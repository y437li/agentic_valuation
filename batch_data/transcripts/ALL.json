At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Pat Macellaro. Sir, you may begin. Pat Macellaro : Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today for Allstate\u2019s first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by Tom Wilson and Steve Shebik, we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the first quarter, and posted a slide presentation to be viewed in conjunction with our prepared remarks. We also posted a document describing our current reinsurance program. These are all available on our website at allstateinvestors.com. As noted on the first slide, our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate\u2019s operations. Allstate\u2019s results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2013, slides and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release and on our website. We are recording this call and a replay will be available following its conclusion. I, along with Steve Shebik, and our Treasurer, Mario Rizzo will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. Now, let\u2019s begin with Tom Wilson. Tom Wilson : Well, good morning. Thank you for investing your time with us to keep updated on Allstate\u2019s progress. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to say a few words about Bob Block, who most of you passed away a couple of weeks ago after a battle with cancer. Bob led our Investor Relations efforts for 17 years and was a member of the Allstate family for 39 years. And everything he did, he was just a consummate professional. He was balanced, direct, thoughtful, respectful. We will miss his expertise and friendship. Bob\u2019s family greatly appreciates all of your messages and prayers as well as the donations many of you made to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network on his behalf. In the room today with me in addition to Pat and Steve are Matt Winter, who leads Allstate Personal Lines; Don Civgin, who is responsible for Allstate Financial and Insurance; Kathy Mabe who leads Allstate Business to Business; Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. Let\u2019s begin with Slide 2. Allstate\u2019s first quarter results show the resiliency and strength of our strategic and operating platform. The strategic decision to create unique customer value propositions for each customer segment in personal lines is providing profitable growth opportunities. Operationally, we are making good progress on all of our 2014 annual operating priorities. Financial results for the quarter were good despite the severe weather in January and February. We also completed two strategic initiatives of the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life was closed on April 1. We also completed the capital restructuring program that we initiated early last year. So, let\u2019s go through each of these and then Steve will cover the operating results. So, the visual depiction of our strategy is on Slide 3. On an overall basis, we achieved policy in force growth of 2% when compared to the previous year quarter, which resulted in a 5.2% increase in net written premiums. Overall, profitability was good with recorded combined ratio of 94.7 despite severe winter weather and the launch of a new advertising program for Esurance. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 88.4, which is in the range we have provided for the full year. Growth was achieved in all segments as you can see from the data in each of the brand specific boxes. If you start in the lower left, which is the largest segment in the market and the largest segment for us which is served by Allstate agencies, we had continued broad-based unit growth of 2.1% in auto, which was offset by a 1.2% decline in homeowners policies given the success of our repositioning of the homeowners line we expect that decline for homeowners to become less of a drag on growth in the future. The recorded and underlying combined ratios were in line with expectations. Esurance in the lower right had another quarter of strong growth. The combined ratio is about where we expected it. There were a number of offsetting pieces. First, there was a large increase in advertising expense. There were the benefits of the profit improvement actions we have put in place in 2013 and then the impact of severe winter weather. The advertising expenses were 28% of premiums in the quarter as we launched new advertising to reinforce the insurance for the modern world positioning. Encompass in the upper left also continued to grow, but at a slower rate than last year. That reflects the profitability improvement actions we have put in place last year and are still working on this year. Answer Financial sells non-proprietary policies through the web and call centers in the upper right, non-proprietary premium increased 10% over the prior year. So, we like the strategic and operating flexibility that the utilization of these different offerings gives us in the marketplace. If you go to Slide 4 our five operating priorities are shown on this page. We just discussed the insurance policies in force growth. So, let\u2019s move to maintaining the combined ratio. The underlying for the combined ratio for the quarter is within our full year outlook. So, it\u2019s a good start to the year. This includes, of course, the impact of severe winter weather. We have been within or better than our expected annual range every year since we started this practice in 2007. And investment returns were good in the quarter. The expected decline in interest income was partially offset by another strong quarter of limited partnership investments. You will remember we shortened the duration of the property liability portfolio, because we did not like the risk and return trade-off of investing in long bonds. As a result, the portfolio yield has decreased versus the last year first quarter. The priority to modernize the operating platform reflects programs to simplify our technology infrastructure and continuous improvement actions, both of which provides greater operating flexibility and improved customer satisfaction levels. Building growth platforms is another important priority given the operating and financial strength of the current business. Improving the Allstate agency effectiveness and expanding capacity to growth in that largest customer segment, expanding Esurance\u2019s product offering will allow us to compete more effectively against the large direct carriers to primarily sell auto insurance. Leveraging the Allstate Benefits platform, which were at 10% over last year is another source of profitable growth. If you move to Slide 5, the financial results generated in the quarter reflect our growth initiatives and proactive approach to managing margins and risk. Revenues were $8.7 billion or 2.6% higher than 2013. This reflects 5.2% growth in the Allstate protection net written premium partially offset by lower capital gains in investment income. Net income of $587 million declined from the prior year quarter primarily due to a decline in operating income and realized capital gains. Operating income of $588 million was 9.1% lower than in the first quarter of 2013 primarily due to higher catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather related losses. Operating income per diluted share decreased only 3.7% to $1.30 reflecting the accretive impact of share repurchases on EPS. Operating income return on equity was 14.4% for the trailing 12 months. We continue to provide strong cash return to the shareholders this quarter, it\u2019s been our history with $113 million of common stock dividend and $987 million in share repurchases for a total of $1.1 billion. Steve will now cover the operating results in greater detail. Steve Shebik : Thanks Tom. I will start by reviewing the first quarter financial highlights on Slide 6. Starting in the upper left, property-liability had earned premium of $7.1 billion in the first quarter, 4.2% higher in the first quarter of 2013 and a recorded combined ratio of 94.7. The underlying combined ratio was 88.4 for the quarter, which is within our full year outlook range of 87 to 89. Catastrophe losses were $445 million, 24% higher in the first quarter of 2013. Net investment income for the property-liability segment was down 8.5% in the prior year quarter, reflecting interest rate risk reduction actions taken during 2012 and 2013. As a result, property-liability operating income in the first quarter was $468 million, 15.8% lower than the first quarter of 2013. The property-liability combined ratio on a recorded and underlying basis is shown in the chart on the upper right hand side of the slide. You can see that both the recorded and underlying combined ratios rose in the first quarter. Severe winter weather as Tom had mentioned impacted the combined ratios of all three brands in the first quarter. The table below this chart provides a view of the underlying combined ratio by brand for the past five quarters. We have also broken out the Esurance underlying loss ratio to provide greater visibility excluding investments in advertising and expansion which are immediately expensed. The Esurance loss ratio remains higher than we would like it to be on a long-term basis so we continued to adjust price \u2013 pricing underwriting to ensure long-term profitable growth. These actions had negative impact on growth which is offset by higher spending on a new advertising campaign to further strengthen the Esurance brand. The Encompass brand\u2019s combined ratio for the first quarter was 102.6. The underlying combined ratio of 91.8% in the first quarter was 6.1 points lower in the first quarter of 2013 and reflects the benefit of ongoing profit improvement actions. We expect to continue our profit improvement initiatives for both Esurance and Encompass brands. Allstate Financial on the bottom end of the slide had a 4.8% increase in premiums and contract charges in the first quarter including a 7.8% increase for Allstate Benefits. Operating income of $189 million was a 31% improvement over the first quarter of 2013, driven by increased investment margin and lower expenses. Net income of $162 million for the first quarter includes an additional $18 million after tax loss on the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. On Slide 7, we showed net written premium and policies in force by brand. For Protection in upper left chart the red line shows the continued trend of policy growth that began in the second quarter of 2013. Overall, policies grew 2% from last year and 0.5% during the first quarter from the fourth quarter of 2013. Each brand achieved growth in the first quarter in both net written premium and policies compared with the prior year\u2019s quarter. Moving to the upper right chart Allstate brand policies ended the quarter 1.1% higher than the first quarter of 2013. Allstate brand grew net written premium 4.3% in the first quarter versus the prior year quarter driven by continued favorable trends in both retention and new business as well as higher average premium. Allstate brand auto net written premium increased 3.3% from the prior year while policies rose 2.1% from the first quarter of 2013. Allstate brand homeowners\u2019 net written premium grew 5.8%, but policied in force declined by 1.2% compared with the prior year. On the bottom two charts you can see growth trends for Encompass and Esurance. Both brands continued their growth in premium and policies in force compared to the first quarter of 2013. Esurance\u2019s rate of growth is slowing due to its increasing size and the pricing and underwriting actions being taken to ensure long-term profitable growth, partially offset by the impact of the higher advertising investment. Keep in mind that the scales on the charts for these businesses are much smaller than the charts at the top of the page. Moving on to Slide 8, the charts on the left hand side show the earned premium and the underlying loss trends for Allstate Brand auto and home, while the charts in the right show the combined ratio trend. For Allstate Brand auto, you can see the impact of non-catastrophe weather in the underlying loss ratio compared with a very favorable first quarter of 2013. Physical damage frequencies increased during the quarter due to challenging winter driving conditions. This increase was concentrated in Midwestern and Eastern states and accounts for almost all of the increase of physical damage frequency in the quarter. Finally, injury frequency declined slightly, while severity showed only modest growth over prior year. We continue to take rate increases as needed in the first quarter as shown on the graph on the upper right, with average state-specific rate increases of 2.5% in 19 states. Despite higher underlying losses in the first quarter, the underlying combined ratio for auto was still within our expected range. For Allstate Brand homeowners, shown on the bottom half of the slide, the first quarter story is similar to auto. Underlying loss costs per policy plus an increase in non-catastrophe weather-related losses such as frozen pipes, ice damage, and higher levels of fire losses. The first quarter increase in homeowners\u2019 losses was driven by states that experienced lower than average temperatures. The combined ratio trends for Allstate Brand homeowners are shown on the lower right hand chart. You can see our underlying 12-month average has essentially flattened out as we approach price adequacy. The composition of our investment portfolio is presented at the top of Slide 9. Over time, we are shifting toward an asset mix we believe will have higher returns. We expect to rely less on interest-bearing assets and more in equity and other assets, where returns is derived from idiosyncratic operating performance. Interest income will remain the largest and more stable component to investment results, while equity investments will have attractive but more available returns in the time. The lower left graph shows first quarter investment income before expenses of $999 million and a portfolio yield of 4.5%. The expected decline in the interest bearing yields 4.1% from 4.3% in the first quarter of 2013 reflects the interest rate reduction in the property liability portfolio and a smaller portfolio due to Allstate financial liability balances. Strong limited partnership income partially offset lower income from the interest bearing portfolio. The last column in the table shows investment results for the quarter exclusive of LDL. The yields are unchanged, but investment income was $126 million lower. Our total portfolio return, presented at the bottom right, was a strong 2.1% for the first quarter reflecting improved fixed income valuations and positive equity market performance. You can see, however, the devaluation impact has been highly variable, while the income yields have been relatively stable in the last five quarters. Finally, on Slide 10, we provide a view of our capital position at the end of the first quarter. During the quarter, we completed the capital restructuring plan commenced last year, which included tendering for and replacing higher fee from senior debt with a mix of lower cost senior debt, hybrids and preferred stock. The result is a capital structure that is stronger and more efficient, along with enhanced financial and strategic flexibility. On the top left chart, we show our capital structure both pre- and post-restructuring, where you can see the substantial reduction in senior debt levels and the increase of hybrid debt preferred stock. A full form review of our capital mix adjusted for the expected pay down of approximately $1 billion of debt during 2014 is also shown on the far left bar. We finished the first quarter with $22.1 billion in total shareholders\u2019 equity, book value per share of 46.70 increased 3.1% since year end and 7.5% since March 31 of last year. The statutory surplus of our operating companies continues to reflect the financial strength of our insurance operations, while deployable assets at the holding company level increased to $3.4 billion at quarter\u2019s end. During the quarter, our Board authorized a new $2.5 billion common stock repurchase program, increased our common share dividend by 12%, which enabled us to return $1.1 billion in cash to common shareholders during the quarter. After completing our previous $2 billion authorization, we began repurchasing common shares under the new program both through open market purchases and the execution of an accelerated share repurchase agreement. Overall, during the first quarter, we repurchased 17.8 million common shares for $987 million. The final number of shares we repurchased under the ASR will be determined when the contract is approved. In addition, we paid 113 million in common stock dividends during the quarter. Overall, in the first quarter, we made good progress in the execution of our customer-focused strategy and achieved each of our operating priorities. We\u2019re well-positioned to continue to effectively execute our differentiated strategy, while delivering strong returns to shareholders. Now, let\u2019s open up the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And first question is from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Capital. Your question please. Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital : Good morning, and let me echo your kind memories of Bob, Tom, he\u2019s definitely be missed by all. Question on Esurance, what exactly is the strategy right now? It seems like the increase in advertising would suggest that you think you\u2019ve got the underwriting fixed within the plan. Is that a fair read of the scenario? Tom Wilson : Bob thanks for the comments about, Bob. They make a macro comment about Esurance is to how it fits into our overall portfolio and then Don can talk about the new advertising program. So, first, we like having four approaches to the marketplace. It gives us ability to get very clean customer value propositions for each of those target segments. For example, an Esurance segment is one of the components of the customer value proposition is give me tools to make me smart, whereas in the Allstate agency channel, it would be my agency \u2013 and my agent knows me so, we can see the difference that \u2013 you can think of that difference as it relates to our operating so, we like the ability it gives us to really hone in and get a customer exactly what they want. It also gives us the ability to compete more effectively against those people who are trying to serve multiple brands and so, we use those brands in conjunction to compete on two fronts as suppose to just competing on one front. We \u2013 obviously in all brands, they are supposed to make the adequate return on capital and we\u2019ve talked about Esurance is progress to improve their loss ratio. We\u2019re happy with where the progress they\u2019re making but they are not where they need to be at. That said that doesn\u2019t stop us from wanting to continue to invest and compete aggressively because the returns are still above our cost of capital in that business. So, Don, perhaps you want to talk about the new advertising program john, you\u2019re actually want to talk about the new advertising program and what we have going. Don Civgin : Yes, hey, Bob, first of all, let me reiterate, I mean our strategy with Esurance is to grow the business as fast as possible while maintaining positive economics over the lifetime of the business we\u2019re running. And we\u2019ve talked about this many times before, but that\u2019s, by definition, going to be reflected in a higher GAAP combined ratio, which you saw again this quarter. It was a pretty exciting quarter for Esurance and they built on a number of things that they\u2019ve been doing with the customer value proposition by continuing to build their advantage. So they continue to be the only direct multiline carrier with the addition of motorcycle homeowners. They continue to build out their features which are making their product differentiated from the competitors and they continue to improve the ease of doing business. The ad campaign, I think we transitioned this past quarter. In the past, we talked about Esurance and what quadrant and what customers they were serving. This past quarter we spent more effort to make sure people understood just how good we were getting within that quartile and against the competitor. So you see us \u2013 went very aggressively against the fact that we can do quotes on the Esurance website instead of the half minutes and obviously we put a lot of advertising rate behind that you can see in the supplement, another 12.8 points in expense. I say by all measures that campaign has worked quite well. The Super Bowl campaign, we had 3.4 million entrants, we had 2.7 billion social impressions. Unaided awareness and consideration of the brand is up to all-time highs. The trust level is up. The quotes are obviously up pretty dramatically in the quarter. And I think those are good results in particular because we\u2019ve been taking a lot of pricing action and lot of underwriting action to get the loss ratio back to where we wanted to be and while we\u2019re not entirely there, as Tom said, absent the January, February whether we\u2019ve actually seen a nice improvement in the loss ratio during the first quarter. I would also say that the results for Esurance in the first quarter are particularly good because we know at least through February, that the main competitors had substantially increased their spend as well. So, I think we feel good about where the campaign is working, it is all predicated our Esurance building a customer value proposition that is differentiated than the competition. And so I think we will continue to build that out, but we still have work to do on the loss ratio and Gary and the team are all over that and we continued to expect \u2013 I would continue to expect us to improve the loss ratio throughout this year. But it\u2019s going to come at same on pressure on the top line. Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital : Okay. And the final question is what free cash was generated from your life company, is it consistent with what your earlier guidance was going to be? Tom Wilson : Bob, do you mean free cash on the sale of Lincoln Benefit or free cash in total? Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital : Yes. Tom Wilson : It\u2019s consistent with what we have, which was $1 billion of freed up capital, but we got \u2013 as you know we got to move it through the system to get it up to the holding company. Bob Glasspiegel - Janney Capital : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Josh Stirling of Bernstein. Your question please. Josh Stirling - Bernstein: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the call. So I wanted to ask you a question, a follow-up on Bob\u2019s question on Esurance, so just to be clear you guys have doubled your ad spend at least in sort of recent run rate. I am wondering if that\u2019s sort of a sense of how you expect to continue to spend money in Esurance. And as we think about looking to profitability of the business going forward should we expect you to continue to spend that kind of money should end and as we think about sort of total earnings is this sort of thing that pays off over the next year or two. Are we going to be lagging sort of the additional ad spend in terms of sort of Esurance driven profitability and Esurance driven underlying growth for some time? Thank you. Tom Wilson : Good morning, Josh. Thanks for your question. Let me split it into a couple of pieces when we launch a new advertising program that\u2019s trying to get new features across, we invest every year upfront in that than we would on a continuing basis. So you saw that whether that\u2019s you buy a Super Bowl ad which is expensive or you just buy a lot more media in February, March. We don\u2019t disclose what our future advertising program will be because that tends to competitive. But the normal pattern will be you invest heavier upfront and then you come back to something that\u2019s more sustainable over time. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to see it at the same \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t expect to see it at the same level and for the rest of the year as you would here. But that said we do believe that to the extent we are writing economic business, we have the earnings capacity as the total company to continue to grow. We have brands that we will continue invest to the extent it is economic. So I would \u2013 our commitment is to grow the business in total to balance between the brands that deliver the right strategy and to serve each customer. How we move that the money around between them as long as we are meeting our overall underlying combined ratio commitment to the street, we feel like we \u2013 it should use the strategic and operating flexibility to drive what are the ultimate economics for the shareholders which is discounted of cash flow. Is that helpful? Josh Stirling - Bernstein: Yes. That\u2019s helpful Tom. Thank you. And if I can ask you just sort of a bigger question and I was sort of looking beyond the numbers to trying to link some of your strategies together, you guys have a very broad product set auto, home, accident, house and traditional life and a couple years ago, you are talking about sort of cross selling I think we are seeing you started to do that, obviously, Esurance, Encompass has been successful for \u2013 with the package for long time and you got sort of the voluntary benefits thing working and in your Allstate brand I am wondering if you can sort of give us the sense of how big a lever this is especially in your more mature channels, will you actually be able to get any meaningful sort of cross selling opportunities from selling say voluntary benefits to PNC or term life and things like that to PNC customers? Tom Wilson : I will make a general comment and Matt can talk about the efforts he has undertaken on what we would call the trusted advisor. So you are right we do have a broad range of products in the portfolio. We are thrilled actually, you saw that Allstate Benefits has now over $3 million policyholders that sometimes gets lost by people. Our Good Hands Roadside is well over 1.5 customers. So we have garnered these \u2013 and that\u2019s product we launched like three years ago or something. We garnered these people like with millions and it tends to get lost because they are so large, but we do think it is an advantage for us. We obviously Don mentioned the work that Esurance is doing to leverage the skills and capabilities we have in the company. We have also created our business-to-business unit under Kathy Mabe, we\u2019re just trying to leverage that broad set of skills and capabilities as it relates to business customers because we\u2019ve always been highly focused on consumers. We think we have plenty to offer businesses, particularly small businesses, and so we have a lot of work going on there. And then, as you point out, we\u2019ve been at in our main channel with Allstate agencies, we\u2019ve been working on having multiline relationships for as long as I been here, which is 19 years. And made some progress, but it\u2019s been one of those areas where we feel like we have much greater potential. And Matt is hard at work on that trusted advisor piece. Matt, do you want to talk a little about\u2026 Matt Winter : Thanks, Tom. So that the company as Tom has described it several times before is really in an evolutionary status. So, we went through period early on where there was an attempt to create a bundled offering for our customers. But that was disrupted somewhat by what happened with homeowners for a four to five period as we had to do some risk mitigation there. When you take homeowners out of the mix, it really is problematic to try to create a diverse set of offerings and present a whole bundled offering to your customers. Now that as you can see homeowners business is back in a fully fledged mode, we then able to shift out of what I call the subcontractor auto specialist mode to more of a general contractor trusted advisor mode for our agency owners who are able to position themselves as the personal risk advisors for their customers offering a variety of risk mitigation and protection products including not only auto, not only home, but life products, but retirement products, motorcycle, renters, LPP, the full line of personalized products in life and retirement products that an individual customer might need and might come to an Allstate agency owner for. The trusted advisor model is based upon some work done by David Meister \u2013 the Meister model and many of you in consulting and others probably familiar with that model and we begun shifting towards a trust based advisory model here and are building the entire system around including the technology, information, capabilities for the agency owners. The processes we\u2019re doing a fair amount of continuous improvement, re-engineering work to change some of the work flows. We\u2019re doing some work that we call unbundling the value chain to make sure that our agency owners are spending their time and energy and the staff is spending their time and energy and think that truly add value to the customers. When you take all of that and combine it, the impact should be and we\u2019re seeing very encouraging early signs of it that they are shifting to more bundled offerings. They are approaching their clients, their customers in a more holistic manner and when we look at our new homeowners business, our homeowners new business right now that 80% of that is bundled with auto, 40% already have an existing auto policy and our purchasing homeowners on top of that, and 40% added a new auto policy at the same time as they purchased the homeowners policy. That\u2019s combined with what are exceptionally strong growth trends in our consumer household lines now shows us that our agency owners are now living into that new model. Life and retirement is going to be more difficult voluntary benefits I could along with that, just because it\u2019s a different type of business from many of them for their longer term agents, it\u2019s something they are not that familiar with for many years. They were used to passing on those leads to others and involving our financial specialists from a distance in that opportunity and now we\u2019re asking them to work with their financial specialist in the more integrated manner. So, I think it holds, and Tom thinks it holds, great promise for us as a company. I think it\u2019s core to our differentiated value proposition for the Allstate agency owners. And I think you should expect to see it receive the increasing degree of emphasis and importance over the next several years. Josh Stirling - Bernstein: Thanks, Matt, Tom. I appreciate the thorough answer. Good luck. Tom Wilson : Thank you. I am very excited about what Matt has got going there. Beside, as Matt pointed out the alignment with customers, we are building stronger local businesses \u2013 those agencies which are worth billions of dollars. One of Matt\u2019s jobs is also to make those agencies worth more and to the extent they have a stronger relationship with customers, it makes them more valuable. I am very excited about what it does for them and for us. Operator : Our next question is from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Your question, please. Jay Gelb - Barclays: Thank you. First, for the impact of non-cat weather on the underlying combined ratio in the quarter, what was that versus a year ago? Tom Wilson : Jay- Matt do you want to I think maybe just talk about winter weather frequency. You are talking about frequencies, is that right Jay. Jay Gelb - Barclays: Yes. I mean I am sure there is a good portion of winter weather that\u2019s not included in the cat impacts I am just trying to get a better sense of the baseline on the underlying excluding the impact of non-cat weather? Tom Wilson : No, it\u2019s really a good question and as you know we manage our business with great precision. Matt can deal with that\u2026 Matt Winter : Yes. So Jay, it\u2019s interesting it was intuitive to all of us that winter weather is going to have an impact on first quarter. But we wanted to really spend some time looking at it in a granular \u2013 at a granular level to ensure that we weren\u2019t just kind of discounting the rise in frequency as the result of winter weather when we weren\u2019t absolutely 100% sure that was the causing factor. So we did some a fairly intense work on a state-by-state basis. So let me give you some facts because I think rather than just conclusions the facts should be helpful. And I will do it on auto and I will do with then on a home for you. So when you look at physical damage frequency for total auto, it was \u2013 the increase was driven entirely by states that experienced increased snowfall or dramatically lower temperatures that caused icing, so let me give you a breakdown there. We had 25 states and we do this comparison by month, by state comparing this year\u2019s snowfall and temperature with last year\u2019s snowfall and temperature looking for statistically significant deviations and what the impact was on frequency. We had 25 states that had increased snowfall and elevated frequency and those 25 states represented about 55% of our premium (indiscernible). The first quarter PD frequency in those states was 7% above the three year average. If you look at the 10 states with the largest increase in snowfall that account for 25% of the total, they contributed over 50% of the unfavorable variance in frequency. So that\u2019s just on the snowfall side. Now look at the temperature side which as I said caused unexpected icing there we had 32 states with colder temperatures that includes 24 of the 25 snowfall states. For some reason Wyoming was an outlier there, that represented 60% of premium in it. And there too we had a 7% rise in three year \u2013 above our three year average for PD frequency. And if you look at those 10 states with the largest decrease in temperature, they contributed over 75% of the unfavorable variance in frequency. So clearly the frequency actually improved in the rest of the country that wasn\u2019t impacted by statistically significant increased snowfall or dramatically lower temperatures. We did the same thing on the homeowner side and remember homeowners we basically experienced three major winter impacts frozen pipes in the Eastern half of the company \u2013 country, fire losses from heating sources in the South especially in Georgia and Texas and ice damming from temperature fluctuations in the Midwest. And the non-cat examples of those \u2013 the space heaters, the fire, the ice damming, many of the frozen pipe claims would not come as cats, they would show up in underlying due to reporting delays, it\u2019s hard to attach them to one particular stronger event and as you know, house fires aren\u2019t cats either. So you look at the impact there 30 states with colder temperature and higher loss ratios representing 70% of the premium NF, that was a 16 percentage point loss ratio increase including cash. So, fairly significant, one other little factoid for you, we had more freeze claims in January alone than the previous 24 months combined, which is a fairly significant occurrence and the biggest one was the January 2nd freeze event in the Midwest and Northeast down to Georgia so, again if you take out those areas impacted by the lower temperatures that cause the house fires, the frozen pipes and the ice damming, the loss ratio absolutely improved in the rest of the country. Did I answer your question, Jay? Jay Gelb - Barclays: Yes, just back on the original point, what was the \u2013 can you quantify the impact of non-cat weather in that underlying combined ratio of 88.4? Tom Wilson : Matt gave you the impact on our frequency. We haven\u2019t taken it so close to say it\u2019s X point of the combined ratio. I would say when you go above all that if you look at our auto combined ratio it\u2019s 93 to 94, depending on which one that you want to use, whether it\u2019s underlying reported. And so, we covered at that way or if you look at homeowners, what we\u2019ve done with homeowners is combined ratio was 87.25 basis. So, while it\u2019s clearly \u2013 and you would expect it to bounce around, so we don\u2019t want to \u2013 weather happens every quarter, sometimes it happens in January and February and it\u2019s cold, sometimes it\u2019s fog, sometimes it\u2019s other things, so we don\u2019t want to act like you should ignore the impact of weather. We still are responsible for an overall combined ratio, but that gave you was the information to help you see that. We don\u2019t think the bump in the underlying combined ratio up is a sustainable bump to the general trends around the country, which are not weather related. But I don\u2019t want you also just taken out and say that next quarter that we\u2019re not going to have weather because we\u2019ll have weather every quarter, is that make sense. Jay Gelb - Barclays: I understand. Absolutely, and then just a quick follow-up on Esurance, it looks like the company is looking to raise rates to address the loss ratio issue. But at the same time, ad spend is also going up, so how do you clarify those two countervailing issues? Tom Wilson : How about we want it all? We want to grow and we want to make money. Jay Gelb - Barclays: Fair enough. Thank you. Tom Wilson : I\u2019m looking at Don as I say that. Operator : Our next question is from John Hall of Wells Fargo. Your question please. John Hall - Wells Fargo : Good morning, everyone. My first question has to do with Allstate Financial. During the quarter, there was a quite significant drop in the expenses over there. I was just wondering if you could comment on sort of the profit profile of Allstate Financial going forward ex-LVL and whether that drop in expenses is a permanent stair step down. Tom Wilson : Okay, Don will take that. Don Civgin : Yes, let me first address the LVL question, it\u2019s \u2013 we had about $34 million of operating income in the quarter that was related to LVL and so obviously going forward that business is no longer part of Allstate. As it relates to expenses given that we reduced the size of our business pretty substantially, you should expect that expenses will come down. We\u2019ve been hard at work during the last six or nine months of expenses. A lot of it is driven by the headcount. The fact is we\u2019re running the smaller business, we\u2019re running a simpler business. Matt and Tom talked earlier about advancing the Allstate customer value proposition with the Trusted Advisor and Allstate Financial over the last 10 years or so has been in a lot of distribution channels that takes a lot of resources, a lot of efforts. With the conclusion of the LVL transaction, we are now committed 100% to the Allstate customer. There\u2019s only one channel. We\u2019re all in on the Trusted Advisor Model. So we\u2019re changing our expense structure and our organization around to simplify it quite honestly make the adjustments we need to because we simply can\u2019t spend the way we did two or three years ago and we\u2019ve been successful in that. We\u2019ve also had benefits from lower pension expense from what we did last year and some shared services expenses and so forth as well. It isn\u2019t all just what we\u2019ve done. But yes we\u2019re committed to getting the expenses down so we can maintain our profitability. Tom Wilson : John, there is a paragraph in the queue that does a good job of breaking out the three components of that which \u2013 when you get a chance we can direct it to you. John Hall - Wells Fargo : Great, thank you. And then just following up on the homeowners if I look at the ads that you guys have been running fire kitchen \u2013 kitchen fire and return of Mayhem as a cleaning person, it seems that you\u2019re actually targeting homeowners rather directly. Should we be expecting homeowners to go from a negative PIF to a positive PIF over the near term? Tom Wilson : I would agree with everything you said other than perhaps near term. We\u2019re obviously working and Matt\u2019s team\u2019s hard work as we talked about and Trusted Advisor is driving that. We\u2019ve not yet called when we think that negative will become positive but obviously with what we\u2019ve done with the homeowners business we like to turn it into a growth initiative as well. John Hall - Wells Fargo : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Vinay Misquith of Evercore. Your question please. Vinay Misquith - Evercore: Hi, good morning. The first question is really on the loss trends versus the earned premiums. In the last four quarters, the loss trends seemed to be up around 1.9% to 2.4% on the Allstate brand auto. And the earned premiums I believe are up around 0.7%. So \u2013 now you guys are taking pricing up (2.4%) now, so that should be a positive for the future. Just curious as to whether we should expect pressure on margins at least in the near term while the earned premiums catch up with the loss trends? Tom Wilson : Vinay, this is Tom, I\u2019ll ask Matt to deal with both where he feels they are in pricing and loss cost trends in auto in general. We do read all of your \u2013 everybody stuff and earlier this morning we\u2019re trying to figure out to you 19. So we couldn\u2019t, so we\u2019ll get back to you on the specific on the 19 after the call. But Matt can talk in general about both where he feels the business and what he is doing to make sure we keep in line with our second priority which is to maintain underlying combined ratios. Matt Winter : Good morning, Vinay. We\u2019re overall feeling very good about where we stand in auto in the underlying and our margin and our capabilities for continued growth and maintenance of good profitability. As I\u2019ve talked about on previous calls we really run the auto business by geography not solely as one large system and it\u2019s managed on a real-time basis by quite confident teams at the market operating committee level who are aware of what\u2019s going on in each geography, watching trends emerge, looking at regulatory issues, watching demographics and other factors and making calls on a day-to-day basis to ensure we\u2019re staying ahead of those trends to the extent we can and that we\u2019re maintaining the margins. And as I said before we breakdown our combined ratio and our loss ratio in what I would call almost agonizing detail. We know what\u2019s happening there. We\u2019re not surprised by any and we feel confident that we\u2019re approaching it in a rational way. We\u2019re as I\u2019ve said also previously trying to optimize the point between growth and profitability to ensure we\u2019re able to continue the kind of growth that we\u2019ve been experiencing recently. We just had in terms of new business production, one of the best total auto quarters since 2001. We like that. Retention is up significantly and it has been up for a steady period of time now and we like that. And we\u2019re balancing our desire to grow, capture market share and retain profitability and ensure we meet all the commitments we\u2019ve made regarding underlying combined ratio. Vinay Misquith - Evercore: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. The second question was on the net investment income on the P&C portfolio and I\u2019m looking at it ex-prepays and litigation. And we actually saw per stabilization in the \u2013 some interest-earning securities there and a stabilization in the yield. Are you doing something now more positive in a sense that changing the asset mix there where we\u2019ll see a stable yield and should we and is your move away from longer duration to shorter duration securities or instead we\u2019ll see more stable net investment income from the earn-out? Tom Wilson : Judy will answer that question and let me make sure I get the math right. So the stabilization are you talking about the earned deals fourth quarter of 2013 to first quarter of 2014 or. Vinay Misquith - Evercore: Yes. Tom Wilson : Stabilization, okay, because it is down about 20 basis points versus a year ago. Vinay Misquith - Evercore: Yes, yes. Judy Greffin : So there is stabilization and as Tom mentioned over the past year we have moved \u2013 shortened the duration in the portfolio. And that work is largely done. So when you look at the portfolio at this point we\u2019ve got a duration a little bit under three years and you plan to stay there for the time-being. So it isn\u2019t necessarily a change in the mix, it\u2019s more that we\u2019ve done the work that we wanted to do. We\u2019re going to continue to see the impact of the work that we did last year in terms of year-over-year but quarter-over-quarter it has largely stabilized where we are today. And the portfolio yield is down so the differential between where we\u2019re investing today in the portfolio yields isn\u2019t as great as it would have been a few years ago. Vinay Misquith - Evercore: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs : Thanks. Tom, I wanted to ask you a little bit about the other personal lines business I mean it\u2019s come up a little bit more recently in some of the calls. A couple billion dollar book I mean it looks like now three quarters of double-digit growth, margins are in mid-to-high 80s on an underlying basis. Want to just get a little bit better understanding of what\u2019s in there. I mean I guess specifically it looks like the growth is coming from Dealer Services and Roadside. What are the margins in those businesses specifically and are those higher \u2013 if you can tell us higher-margin business than the rest of the stuff that\u2019s in there? Thanks. Tom Wilson : Okay. I\u2019ll make some general comments and then Kathy you can talk specifically about what we\u2019re doing in Roadside and Dealer Services. But first when you go all the way up in other personal lines there\u2019s lots of other stuff in there. So there is a number of consumer household products where that be personal umbrella policies, many of the policies Matt talked about that fit inside of that organization and are fully integrated with the way we do with our agencies just like auto, home and everything else. In those businesses Matt mentioned are also growing well. So renters and some other things we\u2019re having a good year there. In addition to that as you pointed out we have a number of other really strong and significant businesses that oftentimes don\u2019t get the attention that auto and home do. So one of those would be Roadside, the other would be Dealer Services. Roadside we have really three parts to that business. There is our standard, our auto \u2013 our Motor Club policies we sell for fee, then we have our Good Hands Roadside where it\u2019s paid when you use it that\u2019s why I mentioned we have over 1.5 customers. And then there is our wholesale business. Kathy, if you can talk about that business is growing quite rapidly in that third piece if she can talk about what she is doing there and what we need to do to \u2013 in terms of profitability there. And then Dealer Services sales extended warranties and things through dealers. That\u2019s also a pretty large business. That\u2019s a longer tail business. So the profitability as you have to \u2013 turns in over time, if she could talk about what we have going there as well. Kathy Mabe : Thank you, and thank you, Michael. With regard to Roadside, Tom talked about the different components. Inside that in terms of it\u2019s profitability the business is growing rapidly. The wholesale business is less profitable than what we call the retail business or the Allstate segment of the business. So in the short term we\u2019re focused on slowing the growth a little bit in the wholesale side while we focus on increasing the profitability of that segment. Where at the same time we\u2019re doing picking steps to aggressively grow the Allstate branded part of Roadside which is highly attractive and we\u2019re doing that, Matt talked about the Trusted Advisor that\u2019s a component of key steps we want to sell through the Allstate agency distribution force. With regard to Dealer Services, there are a number of things going on there. It is a rapidly growing business, most of the growth is coming from the vehicle service contract portion of the business. We feel the \u2013 that it\u2019s adequately priced although we\u2019re taking steps to make sure that we\u2019re getting the profit margin that we need on that business and working aggressively to pursue that. We love some of the synergies that we see in Dealer Services with regard to the property casualty business as well and some of the other businesses in B2B. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs : And I guess the question is I mean you\u2019ve seen them really I mean just looking at your supplement I mean those two have seen the lion\u2019s share of growth in other personal lines over the last at least quarter over the last year. And over that \u2013 over the past couple of years the underlyings have come down and really kind of settled into that 80s, low 90s sort of range. I\u2019m just wondering like are the areas that are growing, are those just more profitable than the others or is there something else that\u2019s happening at the same time that these two areas are growing that\u2019s caused that profitability to kind of settle in? Thanks. Tom Wilson : I think where Kathy was is the wholesale business, it grew quite rapidly, we picked up GM which was the giant account and actually that business is not as profitable of the other businesses, they actually reduced our overall profitability. And in the Dealer Services business we like to profiting, we think it\u2019s got good pricing and it\u2019s growth is profitable. I think Michael there maybe some other pieces in there in terms of what we\u2019re doing in renters and personal umbrella policies. So I would say let us help you we\u2019ll dissect that for you because I think you\u2019re looking at a broader combined ratio measure than just the businesses that we\u2019re talking about. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs : Got it. Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Joshua Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Your question please. Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank : I apologize I have between Jay and John. My questions were answered. Tom Wilson : Okay. It\u2019s easy. Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Meyer Shields of KBW. Your question please. Meyer Shields - KBW: Thanks. One nitpicky question. The corporate expenses went down \u2013 were flat year-over-year, but were down significantly from the fourth quarter. Is the first quarter number a good run rate going forward? Tom Wilson : You\u2019re talking about the corporate expense line we\u2019ve broken out. So there is \u2013 you have \u2013 yes interest expenses down some and then there are some shared service cost that rattled through their pension and other things that are down. In terms of the number we mentioned we took a big shot because we restructured the pension plans added to the balance sheet and as a result in terms of \u2013 we took the liability down and reduced our expenses by well over $100 million a year. So part of that rattles through but a large part of that also as Don mentioned gets allocated back out to him, so which is a good thing so \u2013 because it gets reflected in the profitability of our businesses. So but there is no big trends going on in corporate I guess \u2013 I\u2019d say once you get through the capital restructuring plan and you got to look at the preferred dividends relative to interest expense because that shows up in a different line item. So\u2026 Meyer Shields - KBW: Okay, no, that\u2019s helpful. Bigger picture I guess is there a time frame for expanding the target focus of the Encompass to maybe attack a more broad segment of the independent agency customer base? Tom Wilson : Our current strategy with Encompass is to continue to rollout and expand the package policy because we think we have room geographically to do that and room within some of the agencies to do it that we exist to do business with. And why we\u2019re doing that we\u2019re still working to improve profitability in some of the space. So we\u2019ve actually shrunk Meyer the \u2013 what we would call the segment business which is the standalone auto policy over the last four, five years. Over time I believe you\u2019re right that we know how to price auto, we ought to be back and expanding that business, but right now it\u2019s not on our list of priorities. Meyer Shields - KBW: Okay, great. Thanks very much. Tom Wilson : We\u2019ll take one last question. Operator : Our final question is from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your question please. Adam Klauber - William Blair : Thanks. Good morning. The BI severity was pretty low. It\u2019s been trending down. Is that more Allstate specific actions or is that some market phenomena? Tom Wilson : It\u2019s hard to answer what the market phenomena is, but Matt might want to talk some about the actual results we have. Matt Winter : Yes. I think well that\u2019s an interesting question to try to break it down from the entire market. We have \u2013 as I said before we\u2019ve taken a fair amount of effort to look at this on a state-by-state basis and manage it as well as we could. We \u2013 there is always geographic mix issues and policy limit shifts and other things that impact that. And I guess I would say I don\u2019t believe that we\u2019ve done anything dramatic recently to indicate a trend line that you should read into this. Tom Wilson : So remember part of the trend is Florida. We have some profit issues in Florida and New York, they tend to be BI space. So it\u2019s (definitely) \u2013 you really got to look at it by state. And I would say if you go all the way up and it\u2019s we\u2019re \u2013 to the extent our BI cost severities go up, frequency goes up in BI or same with PD frequency or severity will reflect that in our pricing and all of it is manageable if you look at our average pricing and we\u2019re feeling pretty good about it. Adam Klauber - William Blair : Okay, thanks a lot. Very helpful. Tom Wilson : Thank you all for participating in our strategy. It gives us the flexibility as you can see they\u2019re operating in a variety of different customer segments and we\u2019re going to stay highly focused on our 2014 priorities. And the success we\u2019ve had maybe proactive from an operating and strategic standpoint over the last four years. It put us in a position to just begin to build on a great franchise. Thank you all. We\u2019ll see you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Operator : Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Allstate Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Pat Macellaro, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patrick Macellaro : Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Allstate's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by Tom Wilson and Steve Shebik, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the second quarter, posted a slide presentation to be viewed in conjunction with our prepared remarks. We also posted an update to the description of our reinsurance program. These are all available on our website at allstateinvestors.com. As noted on the first slide, our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2013, our 10-Q for the second quarter, slides and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures which there are reconciliations in our news release and on our website. We're recording the call today and a replay will be available following its conclusion. I, along with Steve Shebik, will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. And now, let's begin with Tom Wilson. Thomas J. Wilson: Well, good morning and thank you for investing your time to keep updated on Allstate's progress. In addition to Pat and Steve with us today in the room is the team that delivered these results. Matt Winter, who leads Allstate personal lines; Don Civgin, who's responsible for Allstate Financial and Insurance; Kathy Mabe, who leads Business to Business; Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. Let's begin on Slide 2. Allstate's second quarter results demonstrated our ability to concurrently grow the business and generate attractive returns. Our strategy to create unique customer value propositions for each consumer segment is working and has helped us compete in new and different ways. So in the last 12 months, we've added almost 750,000 Property-Liability policies in force. In addition, we added another 900,000 relationships through our Good Hands Roadside in Allstate Benefits offerings. Positive growth momentum is building, particularly in the Allstate brand. Secondly, we made good progress on all of our 2014 operating priorities. Third, we recorded very good financial results. Net income was $614 million for the quarter, which you can see in that bottom table, which was higher than last year since there was a loss on the extinguishment of high-cost debt in the 2013 results. Operating income was $1.01 per share, excellent results in light of incurring $936 million of catastrophe losses. Strong underlying profitability, lower expenses and good investment results all contributed to the positive operating result. The decline in operating earnings versus the prior year was due to higher catastrophe losses. Lastly, we improved our financial strength while returning capital to shareholders. The 18-month $2.5 billion share repurchase program approved in February is now 40% complete after 4 months. Open-market purchases were made throughout the quarter to accelerate the stock repurchase program and the company share repurchases, which were alongside that program. I think, when you look at the supplemental number of people that didn't understand the fact that the company's repurchases are in addition to the open-market purchases made under the ASR. Overall, we're executing well and we're poised to grow with attractive returns and further leverage our capabilities to create shareholder value. We go to Slide 3, this visually combines our strategy and our current operating results for each customer segment. So overall, the 750,000 increase in Property-Liability policies represents a unit growth rate of 2.2%. Increased average premiums for our Allstate Protection net written premium growth to 5.5% over the prior year. The reported combined ratio of 97.4% reflects 13 points of catastrophe losses. Therefore, the underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 84.7%. Let's walk through each of the customer segments, starting with the Allstate brand, which represents 91% of written premiums. As you can see in the lower left quadrant, Auto policy growth increased again this quarter and was 2.3%. Working across the growth line, the decline in homeowners continues to shrink and was now down to 0.5% this quarter. Other personal lines are growing, bringing total policy in the fourth -- force growth in this segment to 1.5% and net written premium growth to 5%. We're also pleased with the profitability in this segment with a recorded combined ratio of 95.4%, which you can see in the third line on the far right there. If you go back to the left, the Auto reported combined ratio was also 95.4%, which results from a disciplined and precise set of operating processes focused on matching price to risk and costs. We continue to have modest increases in Auto prices, which were up 0.5% this quarter, excluding Canada. A few analyst called about the investor supplement, which shows no increase in total because it impacts a large mandatory reduction in Ontario auto pricing. Another measure of Auto pricing discipline is average gross written premium, which is 2.6% higher than a year ago. Moving to the next column. The reported homeowners combined ratio was 98.6%, despite almost 39 points of catastrophe losses. An underlying combined ratio of 60.2 for this product gives us confidence that we can create shareholder value and improve our competitive position by growing this line. Esurance in the lower right had another quarter of strong growth with policies in force of 17.5%, although this is lower than last year, as expected. The combined ratio of this brand reflects the immediate expensing of acquisition costs has improved from last year due to profit-improvement actions taken to ensure we get acceptable economic returns. Encompass in the upper left also continued to grow policies, but at a slower rate than last year, also as expected. With an underlying combined ratio of 94.8%, there's still more work to be done to raise returns. Answer Financial sells nonproprietary policies, that's in the upper right, through the Web and call centers. Nonproprietary premium increased 12.6% over the prior year. Our 5 operating priorities are shown on Slide 4. So we just covered the second quarter results on growth and profitability, so I'll give you a chance to just read the bullet points, then I'll move on to the next 3 priorities. Investment returns were favorable in the quarter as higher limited partnership income more than offset the expected decline in interest income. You will remember the risk and return trade out we made in shortening the duration of the Property-Liability portfolio, which resulted in capital gains but lowered investment income by over $100 million annually. Our efforts to modernize the operating model showed up in lower operating expenses at Allstate Financial, reflecting actions taken because of the sale of Lincoln Benefit. The benefit plan changes made in 2013 also led to lower expenses. Long-term growth efforts include expanding our Allstate agency capacity in underserved markets. Allstate agencies are also investing in growth alongside the company, and collectively, we're working to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of this powerful local model. Esurance continue to expand its business and it offers auto insurance in 43 states; renters insurance in 18 states; motorcycle insurance in 9 states; and homeowners insurance in 7 states as of the end of the quarter, and we continue to expand that product portfolio throughout the year. The breadth of this set of underwritten products is designed to give us a competitive advantage by better serving customers and lowering acquisition costs in comparison to other direct writers. We're also investing aggressively in telematics and are achieving rapid growth in utilization of the Allstate-branded Drivewise and Esurance DriveSense offerings. We're testing additional features, which extend the benefits of being connected beyond more accurate pricing. In summary, halfway through the year, we've made very good progress on our 2014 priorities. Steve will now cover the operating results in greater detail. Steven E. Shebik: Thanks, Tom. I'll begin by reviewing the second quarter financial highlights on Slide 5. Beginning with the upper left, Property-Liability earned premium of $7.2 billion in the second quarter was 5% higher than the second quarter of 2013. Recorded combined ratio of 97.4% increased 1.3 points versus the comparable 2013 quarter, driven by $936 million in catastrophe losses, which were 45% higher than the prior year. The underlying combined ratio was an 84.7% for the second quarter and 86.6% year-to-date, which is below our full year outlook range of 87% to 89%. Net investment income for the Property-Liability segment increased 2.3% from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by limited partnership income. Property-Liability operating income in the second quarter was $364 million, 15.9% lower than the second quarter of 2013. The Property-Liability combined ratio on a recorded underlying basis is shown in the chart on the upper right-hand side of this slide. You can see that while the recorded combined ratio rose in the second quarter due to catastrophe losses, the underlying combined ratio was very favorable, as we did not experience a repeat of the adverse weather encountered in the first quarter. A tail below this chart provides a view of the underlying combined ratio of trends by brand for the past 6 quarters. We have also broken out Esurance underlying loss ratio to remove the impact of investments in advertising and expansion, which are immediately expensed and provide greater transparency to our ongoing profit-improvement actions. As Tom mentioned earlier, you can see the Esurance loss ratio starting to benefit from the actions that we've taken to date. Allstate Financial, on the bottom half of the slide, had a 10.5% decrease in premiums and contract charges in the second quarter, resulting from the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. Operating income of $165 million was a 5.1% improvement over the second quarter of 2013, driven by higher investment and benefit spreads and lower operating expenses. Net income of $145 million for the second quarter includes an additional $13 million after-tax loss on the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. Excluding LBL's second quarter 2013 results, operating income increased by 31%, and net income declined by 10.5% in the second quarter of 2014. Our second quarter 2014 10-Q and investor supplement both contained estimated historical results for Lincoln Benefit Life, provided with further contexts. Allstate Financial is now a smaller but more focused company, but still capable of producing meaningful operating income. On Slide 6, we showed net written premium and policies in force growth rates for Allstate Protection and by brand. For Allstate Protection, in the upper left chart, the red line shows the continued trend of policy growth that began in the second quarter of 2013. Policies have grown by 735,000 or 2.2% from last year's second quarter and 407,000 or 1.2% from yearend 2013. Each brand where we accept underwriting risk achieved growth in the second quarter in both written premium and policies compared with the prior year quarter. Moving over to the upper right chart. Allstate Brand policies ended the quarter 1.5% higher than the second quarter of 2013, growing 463,000 policies. The Allstate Brand grew net written premium 5% in the second quarter versus the prior year quarter, driven by continued variable trends in new business, retention and higher average premium. Allstate Brand Auto net written premium increased 4.9% from the prior year, while policies rose 450,000 or 2.3% from the second quarter of 2013. Allstate Brand homeowners net written premium grew 4.3%, while the rate of decline in policies in force slowed to 0.5% or 28,000 policies compared with the prior year quarter. On the bottom 2 charts, you can see the growth trends for Encompass and Esurance. Encompass policy in force growth continues to slow, reflecting actions taken to ensure acceptable, long-term returns. Net written premium growth of 8.3% in the second quarter compared to the second quarter 2013 reflects higher average premiums due to rate increases that are earning in over time. Esurance's rate of premium and policy growth continues to slow due to its increasing size, as well as the ongoing pricing and underwriting actions underway to ensure long-term profitability. Total Esurance premium has grown over 65% and policies in force over 80% since its acquisition in October of 2011. Slide 7 highlights Allstate Brand auto and homeowners underlying margin trends. The charts on the left side show Allstate Brand auto and home combined ratio trends, while the charts on the right show quarterly change in earned premium and underwriting loss trends. As you can see, while there's volatility in the trends in the charts on the right, longer-term, underlying combined ratio results on the left have been fairly stable and demonstrate the success we experience with maintaining auto margins while improving homeowners. For Allstate Brand Auto, in the upper right-hand chart, we expect frequency results that performed within historical ranges in the second quarter, as the adverse impact of severe winter weather in the first quarter was not repeated. Severity results showed only modest increase over the prior year, resulting in a decline in the average underlying loss in the second quarter of 1% compared with the second quarter of 2013. We continue to earn previously approved Auto rate increases as average earned premium increased 1.6% in the second quarter compared to the prior year quarter. For Allstate Brand homeowners, in the lower right-hand chart, we also experienced more favorable underlying losses in the second quarter compared with the first quarter. Average earned premium continues to increase, although at a slowing rate as we approach rate adequacy in total. We continue to take rate increases as needed in both lines to keep pace with loss trends and maintain our underlying combined ratio. On Slide 8, in the top left graph, you see the composition of the investment portfolio and the impact of the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life, which reduced the size of the portfolio by $12 million. Over time, we are shifting the portfolio composition to an asset mix we believe will have higher returns, relying less on interest-bearing assets and more on equity and other assets where return is derived from idiosyncratic operating performance. Our total portfolio return presented in the top right was a strong 2.2% in the second quarter, reflecting increased fixed income valuations and positive equity market performance. You can see, however, the devaluation impact is highly variable, while the income yield has been relatively constant over the last 5 quarters. Our second quarter investment income before expenses was $932 million, with a total portfolio yield of 4.7%. The lower half of the slide provides the investment income in yield for the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial portfolios, each of which now comprise approximately 50% of the portfolio. For the Property-Liability portfolio, in the lower left graph, the interest-bearing yield has stabilized after the 2013 rate risk reduction actions Tom mentioned, while the total yield illustrates the variability in income, then a result of equity investments, including our limited partnership investments. The Allstate Financial Portfolio in the lower right graph trends more consistently. However, you can see the decline in our second quarter income driven by the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. Our capital position is strong. Turning to Slide 9. On the left side, you can see the change in the composition of our capital structure over time from senior debt to hybrid debt and preferred stock. A pro forma view of our capital mix adjusted for the expected repayment of $650 million of senior debt in August is also shown on the far left bar. We took advantage of favorable market conditions in the second quarter, issued additional $250 million of noncumulative actual preferred stock, providing further financial and strategic flexibility. During the quarter, we repurchased 142 million of common shares through open-market purchases and paid $125 million in common stock dividends for a total cash return to common shareholders of $267 million, bringing total common shareholder cash returns to $1,370,000,000 year-to-date. We completed the accelerated share repurchase program announced in March on June 29, with receipt of 1.77 million in additional shares. Book value per common share was a record $47.97, increasing 5.9% since yearend, and 15.2% since June 30th of last year. Our estimated statutory surplus at June 30 is $18 billion. Allstate Life distributed $700 million in a return of capital to its parent, the Allstate Esurance company during the quarter. Our operating income return on equity was a strong 13.7% in the second quarter on a trailing 12-month basis, but lowered in the full year 2013 return of 14.5%, reflecting the impact of higher catastrophe losses in the first half of this year, along with higher equity. The increased equity is a result of our 2013 benefit and planned assumption changes. As you can see in the table in the upper right, average trailering equity is essentially flat from yearend 2013 to June 30. The impact of the benefit changes were entered into the calculation in the third quarter. Overall, we continue to make good progress on the execution of our customer-focused strategy and our operating priorities in the second quarter. Now let's open the call up for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division : The underlying P&C combined ratio of 84.7%, if my data is right, that's the best of any quarter in the past 6 years. So first, it's a great result. Second, just wanted to see if there was any lack of knockout weather or other factors that would cause that to be lower than you might think on a go-forward basis? Thomas J. Wilson: Jay, make sure I get the second part of that question, so the question was whether weather had an impact on growth? Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division : No. I'm sorry. The underlying combined ratio of knockout weather or any other factors. Thomas J. Wilson: Yes. First, thank you. We feel like we've made a lot of progress. Matt can talk about the underlying combined ratio. Matthew E. Winter: Jay, there was nothing out of the ordinary this quarter from an underlying standpoint. As you know, we just had -- we had a lot of rate earning in, we had a fairly careful management of claims continuing and we had an underwriting expense ratio that was down. And as a result, all of the discipline that's been put into the business over the past many years is just starting to show through. Frequency improved, trends were broad-based, paid severity was pretty much in line on the BI side. On the PD, actually, we had some claims that shifted over from first quarter to second quarter because of such a high claim volume in the first quarter. So some third-party subro demands came in, in the second quarter. And so that just changed quarter-over-quarter a little bit on the PD side. But overall, there was nothing extraordinary there, nothing out of the ordinary. And we think it's just a continuation of the hard work that's been put into the business. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division : All right. And then, the pace of share buybacks slowed pretty meaningfully in 2Q relative to 1Q. And as you mentioned in the prepared remarks, the accelerated share repurchase program probably had a fair amount to do with that. But I'm just trying to get a better sense of what a normalized buyback pace might be on a go-forward perspective. Steven E. Shebik: So as I said, we completed our accelerated share buyback program we started in March. I think, Tom noted, instead of June 29, it was actually July 29 that we completed it. When we got into a program like that, effectively we give the buyback program for that piece to another party, in this case, it was Barclays. So they buy over a period of time, in this case, 4 months. So we buy alongside them, but we effectively get a fair amount of the shares, from the money we provide to Barclays, upfront. So we recorded all that in the first quarter. So we had such a strong buyback number in the first quarter. In the second quarter is really open-market purchases alongside the program and that program has now ended this week and we are back in the market ourselves buying. So if you think we are -- it was announced within the $2.5 billion buyback over 18 months essentially, you do some division, it's about $150 million a month is kind of the ongoing rate we go and there are times when we accelerate that generally earlier in the program. Over the summer, we generally go a little bit slower than $150 million. Now we do have a strong capital position, clearly. So we have probably more flexibility than we've had in prior years when during the hurricane season, probably July to September, we'd slow down our program. Thomas J. Wilson: Jay, let me build on Steve's answer there. So we're 40% of the way done in 20% at the time. So there should be no confusion as to our commitment to do this aggressively. I think, what you do see is the way the numbers get accounted that makes it look like we're not active in the market. We're active in the market and we're aggressively buying back as much as we think is prudent, given the flow. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Capital. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : I want to pyramid into your bullet point on modernizing operating structure in Allstate Financial, just to get a sense of where the cost structure is on a go-forward basis. You have a program that reduce expenses, you're absorbing a little bit more of corporate overhead without Lincoln in the mix. When are you sort of at your right run rate of expenses and how much lower can it go from the current rate? Thomas J. Wilson: Bob, let me make a comment about general corporate expenses. And then, Don can address Allstate Financial. So we've always been about reducing expenses, whether that be the benefit plan changes we talked about last year, which reduced expenses and you see ran through the P&L, or just our normal continuous improvement simplification. The benefit we now have is by growing revenues, you'll see more of that flow through the bottom line. So in the past, when revenues and PIF counts were going down, it's hard to get ahead of that in terms of your expense ratio. So what you should begin to see is our growth rate a little more incremental margin for us. And Don can talk specifically about Allstate Financial because he's doing a great job of getting ahead of the downsides in there. Donald J. Bailey: All right. Thanks, Tom. So the strategy for Allstate Financial has been the same for a number of years, that's been to simplify our focus so that we're all about the Allstate customer and the Allstate Agency. The Lincoln benefit transaction, obviously, was an important step in that because it not only reduced the size of the balance sheet, allowed us to free up some capital for the parent company, but also then allowed us to focus all of our efforts on 1 distribution channel, which is the Allstate channel. There has been a lot of hard work, and thanks for noticing it, that has taken place to try and get our cost structure down because we're a smaller company. I think, we've made good progress, you see it in the numbers. At the same time, we're taking cost down, we're simplifying what we do so that we can be more effective, it's serving the Allstate customers and the Allstate agencies. We're not through the transition yet with Lincoln Benefit Life. We still have a good year or so of work to do to get that behind us. But I expect to see us continue to work hard to manage our expenses so that we can continue to deliver really strong operating results. Thomas J. Wilson: And Bob, I'd just add 1 other point, as part of corporate overhead, I prefer to call it corporate value add. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Tom, you sort of anticipated my follow-up and gave a partial answer to the question I was going to ask which is on the PC side, you see it in the solid expense ratio improvements. Going forward, are we likely to see any underwriting improvement more likely to come from the expense ratio than a loss ratio given that you're saying you're trying to move rates up in line with loss cost growth? Thomas J. Wilson: I'll let Matt answer it for ff course, our biggest business, which is the Allstate agency piece. I would just point out, as it relates to Esurance, the expense ratio is dependent on how aggressively we want to grow the business and how much advertising we're doing. Matthew E. Winter: Bob, it's Matt. Thanks for your question. We're looking -- we try to manage both components. I wouldn't say that we're trying to use 1 lever over the other lever. I think, we have to be conscious of and monitor and manage both the loss cause and the expense side of the house. As Tom mentioned, now that we're in growth mode, it gives us the flexibility of making some investments for the long term. It gives us the ability to leverage our scale and efficiency. It gives us the ability to do some things, some of the work we're doing now in continuous improvement to really go through some of our processes, really make sure they're as efficient, effective and customer-focused as possible. That will help us leverage our scale and size that will help us be more efficient. And so my expectation and the team's expectation is that we will be diligent on both components of the combined ratio and not look to just use 1 lever versus the other. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling from Bernstein. Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : So listen, I wanted to switch gears a bit and talk a bit about growth. You guys have come out of a number of years of sort of stabilizing the business and shrinking volumes in some of your lines, you've been growing for the past year. Longer term, really interested in what you guys can do to get more leverage out of your -- the other core Allstate Agency platform. It sounds, from, what, your presentation this morning, that it sounds like you're starting to add agents again. Kind of curious if that's new headcount in agencies, is it new principals? And also, you've done a lot, I think, to sort of reposition the organization to focus more on cross-selling and trying to leverage benefits package and things like that. I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of sort of broadly what you're doing? And then, for big picture, whether these are the sorts of things that can kind of help you maintain share, whether there's -- whether any of them are sort of material to allow them -- you to actually begin to grow unit volumes, say, in excess of household formations or something like that? Thomas J. Wilson: Let me start with the last part, and Matt can give you the specifics on the Allstate Agency piece. So our overall plan to increase share of the business is really focused on having unique customer value propositions for each segment. And so Matt has a unique customer value proposition that for those people who want local advice and a branded product, he can talk about the things he's doing to make that resonate, which includes many of the things you mentioned. At the same time, we look at both share of revenue and policies, as well as share of profits. So as you know, the overall industry return in the property casualty business, broadly defined, including commercial and personal lines, is about 7%. We'd like to continue to maintain our attractive returns and have a greater share of that than we do the top line, we believe we can grow both with our differentiated proposition and Matt will talk about specifically what he's doing. And he is -- that business is building momentum, I feel good -- the flywheel is turning on that one. Matthew E. Winter: Josh, thanks for your question. As you noted, there's been a fairly strong emphasis on getting the Allstate agency force growing again and getting the entire Allstate brand business growing again. So we look at it in a couple of different categories and we refer to capacity building, capability building and activity creation. And so on the capacity building, we are, in fact, increasing points of presence, points of distribution presence, both EAs and license sales professionals. So we do have a fairly significant and aggressive campaign to grow the Allstate agency force, but it is not just putting on numbers, it's putting on quality agencies in strategically deployed areas where we're under-penetrated and we believe that there's extra market potential. And we will continue to do that fairly aggressively because it's working for us, we're doing that in areas where we have not historically been able to penetrate. And we're using new and fairly creative methods of doing that, including the Allstate Auto dealer program, where we place Allstate agencies in car dealerships, which, in the heartland especially, is enabling us to service a very wide geographic area in a very efficient way. We're also using what was formerly the Allstate direct group in a support mode for the Allstate agencies, we call it the extra hands. And so we are deploying that large call center force to create additional capacity for the agencies, both after hours, weekends, and in additionally, for overflow, when they're capacity-constrained during the day. So in the capacity creation, lots of things going on that we think create long-term sustainable growth capacity. On the capabilities side, Tom has mentioned, I think, on several calls, our push to create an advisory capability within the Allstate agency and grow that. So we refer to it as trusted advisor. It's our initiative to focus the Allstate agency force on more advisory and service functions and less transactional functions where we believe their differentiation stands through to the customer base where we think that they provide extra value, where we de-commoditize Esurance and do not accept the fact that auto or homeowner insurance is merely a pricing play. That's truly just a commodity. We don't believe that and so we're expending a lot of energy and effort building the advisory capability within our Allstate agency force from a technology perspective, from a service perspective, information perspective, process and marketing perspective, you'll see a lot of our recent marketing and our agent recruiting materials are very focused on the trusted advisor piece. And on the activity side, we spent a lot of energy and effort improving our close rates, improving quote activity, improving retention through customer-focused experience work and other things to improve our relationships with our customers and retain them for a longer period of time. So on the activity side, we think we've been quite successful with our broadening the target, with our quote generation. And you'll see -- you have seen how that's flowed through in the Auto results. On the home side, as Tom mentioned, the deceleration in the decline in homeowners is just accelerating. So we are flattening out and positioning to grow there as well. And as Tom mentioned many times, our goal there has been to grow in a very disciplined manner so that the volatility of that line is still acceptable for our shareholders, our customers and for the corporation. And we think we've been pretty successful on that. If you just look at the last 8 quarters, we've had 8 consecutive quarters with a recorded combined ratio under 100. And during that time, we had $2.1 billion of underwriting income at a combined ratio of 83.1%, despite $2.5 billion in tax. That's a pretty significant event, that's a fairly significant accomplishment. And that has given us the confidence to begin growing the homeowners line again in a thoughtful and disciplined manner. And when we look at that and we look at the underlying combined ratio during that same 8 quarter periods was 63.2%. And as we've said multiple times, our goal is to deliver low 60s combined ratio in the homeowners business and we did that in a period that included Superstorm Sandy and some of the worst winter weather we've seen in quite a while. So the last part of your question, which was the ability to cross-sell, we -- you've seen an uptick in our other personal lines business. You saw that in 2013 that, that line was declining. In 2014, we began growing again in that. Most of that growth is driven by renters and condo, which we think are very important to creating long-term relationships with our customers and enabling cross-sell of other products, including auto. It probably would have been faster had it not been for the decline in the involuntary auto piece of that line. And as you know, the involuntary auto is what we get depending upon whether other auto carriers, specifically in New York and New Jersey, accept higher-risk customers. And lately, they've accepted more customers. We've had less involuntary auto, and so that has slowed down the growth in other personal lines. But overall, we feel quite good about our ability to serve all the needs of our customers. We have stopped really referring to it as cross-sell and refer to it as providing household solutions to meet the needs of our customers. So we're not so interested in trying to acquire a customer and then push another product on them, but to acquire a customer and meet all of their needs and the needs of their households with our full product portfolio. So we feel quite good about our positioning for growth and our ability to sustain that growth over the long term. Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Matt, that's really pretty comprehensive. I guess, maybe sort of a high-level question for Tom. You've increasingly given more visibility in your communications to all of us talking about telematics and you mentioned the strategic investments here today. I'm wondering if you can give us some color on how you guys thinking about sort of your go-to-market strategy is evolving in Esurance and Allstate? And big picture, is this something that's going to be a growth engine for you guys? Or is it more an opportunity to increase your connectivity with customers and something we should basically look for as a benefit to, say, retention, for example? Thomas J. Wilson: It's a good question. I would say that the connected car space is developing rapidly. We're right in the middle of it and it's hard to determine exactly where it will come out. But I can give you the 3 components that we're working on. So first and most importantly, being able to be connected with our customers helps us get more accurate pricing on their behalf. And as we've talked about in the past, we're making estimates as to what an individual customer should have. We've been very good at that, and that's given us a competitive advantage. You can see that in the homeowner results that Matt was talking about. Knowing how a specific person drives gives us the ability to do an even better job, and we can provide them a 10% to 30% discount if in fact they connect with us. And it's every bit as powerful as credit, so we're actively and aggressively working to expand that portion of our business. Secondly, we're working to improve the driving experience. So we have a number of features that we're developing, which improves somebody's driving experience which takes their relationship with us essentially beyond auto insurance. We don't know where that will exactly come out yet, we're investing aggressively. And to Bob Glasspiegel's point, and what Matt said, was look, we invest where we want to invest, and we cut cost where we think it's not really adding customer value. In that component of our telematics offering, we're investing aggressively in trying to decide what are the number of alternatives. We've launched some new features last quarter on teen driving and we'll continue to roll out new features to better the driving experience. The last component of our offering is how do we best utilize and monetize some of the data that will be created from that connection on behalf of our customers. And we're collecting billions of miles of traffic data and all kinds of other data, how cars work, what they work, what they're like in different weather condition. And that is the most nascent of our efforts. It's not an area where we have a traditional source of expertise in monetizing data. I was very good in using data. And we make a lot of money by monetizing on behalf of our shareholders, how we help other people use that data and how we capture that revenue source on behalf of the company is yet to be determined. So it is both more accurate pricing, better experience which lead in part to retention. But we also think mainly to other revenue streams and then just solely new revenue streams. So it's really all 3 of those components. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I guess, 1 question I had, sort of bigger picture, I mean, the homeowners trending well, underlyings are good, PIF trends moving in the right direction, auto underlying was nice, and it doesn't like -- or from your comments, it doesn't sounds like it was a one-off. Other personal lines growing, looks like low 80s underlying there. And then, Esurance is improving. So I'm just trying -- I guess, I'm trying to understand, your 87 to 89 combined as a target, it would seem that we're on a glide path to come in below that, unless I'm missing something. Can you comment on how we should think about that? Thomas J. Wilson: Sure, Michael. First, we, of course, as you point out, we give an operating range of a couple of points for the year, at the beginning of the year, because we want you all to have some confidence that this is where we think the business will come out. And this year, we picked 87 to 89 which was a point lower than the range we had last year, which was reflective of our team -- here is confidence in the -- in all the metrics you just talked about. So for the first 6 months, I would point out, you're right, we're slightly below that in terms of the underlying combined ratio over towards the lower end. But as you also know, frequency can bounce around a good point in any period of time. So we don't feel any need to change that range. We don't do it to try to help people get -- do operating EPS calculation. We do it to give you a sense to how good we feel about the business. We still feel good about the business. We think 87 to 89 generates really attractive returns and we can grow in that range. So we don't have any plans to change it at this point. What I would take the opportunity to do is sales message, we saw all the things you talked about, that means evaluation should be a much higher multiple of both. Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : All right. That's fair. I guess, the other question I have was just, so would you guys calculate an industry loss estimate for 2Q just across the country? Because it looks like you guys are at about 900, just over that. I mean, I look at some industry loss estimates, it did show that 2Q was a relatively light quarter. Can you try to help -- I was trying to square that, is it where you're located or maybe just a conservative view of where losses may end up? I'm just trying to... Thomas J. Wilson: Are you talking about auto and home? Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Yes. So I mean, you're not -- looking at some cat losses for the second quarter, 930. It looks like industry loss estimates are somewhere in the $6 billion to $7 billion range and that's commercial, personal, across-the-board and domestically. So I mean, just trying to square that versus your sort of market share. Thomas J. Wilson: Yes, I think, I would make 2 comments. One, it's a little early to figure out where exactly the industry is because people are just reporting now and it takes us a while to get the information. Secondly, we do obviously look externally at how our results compare to everybody else. But we break it down. We look in total, but we're really more concerned about what happens locally. So this is a local business. We underwrite price, do our agencies, everything is local. And so we would really look and say, well, how are we doing it in Colorado relative to other people in Colorado on all fronts. That would be not just in catastrophes, it would be BI, it would be physical damage. And we have a number of tools we use to do that. Obviously, starting with pricing, but going all the way through to claims or some industry databases we use on claims. And I think, the summary, I would say, of all that is the machine that we have in place, which is a set of business processes, disciplines, rewards, recognition, analytics, they help us maintain our profitability. And the zones we talked about is working, we think it's working well. We see Matt's team is adjusting where they need to adjust and that has obviously been through for a long time on auto insurance. You're now seeing that same discipline and set of practices being applied to the homeowner's business. And so we feel good about where we're at relative to the industry. Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Great. And then, just really quickly, Esurance, as your actions continue, I mean, it looks like you took mid single-digit rate, PIF is still in that high teens. What do you expect or what are you hoping to kind of get that to or when were you hoping to get that to sort of underlying profitability or at least getting that loss back down as close to 0 as possible? Thomas J. Wilson: I'll let Don talk about the specifics that they're doing at Esurance. I would tell you though, from a capital allocation standpoint, the conversations that Steve and I, and Don and I have about that business are it should grow as fast as they can, assuming we are earning above our cost of capital on the business that we write. If we're not getting the right return on it, then we're not interested in growing. The returns on the business we write are well above our cost of capital, slightly below what we would make in a large existing business like Allstate, which has a huge legacy book associated with generating a lot of profitability. But it's got to be profitable what we do. Donald J. Bailey: I mean, there's a -- little I can add to that. I mean, the reality, our goal is to run Esurance in a way where we're economically profitable. What you're looking at is the GAAP profitability, which of course, is impacted by the fact that we're expensing the advertising upfront and there's also a couple of points of investment in other products and expansion that doesn't necessarily pay off in the quarter as well. I'm really pleased that the work that Gary and his team have done over the last year or so, the loss ratio is beginning to pay off. We're beginning to see it in the numbers with the loss ratio coming down again. So I feel good about where they are. We'd just like to see them continue to grow. And I don't think we want to put an artificial target of a GAAP combined ratio because I think that will stifle the growth that we're seeing at economic terms right now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Just first question is on the loss cost trend. If you would look at your Slide 7, it looks like both from auto and homeowner, the underlying loss trend have been ticking down from recent adequate levels. So could you give a little bit more color on that? And how do you think about sort of, in general, the economy, the inflation and as the economy recovering? Matthew E. Winter: Yes, Kai, it's Matt. Well, I'm looking at that, I looked at those same 2 charts on 7, and I look at it as kind of reverting more towards the norm. I don't see it as that much of a directional change. I think, we had an aberration on the auto side for a couple of quarters. It looks like it's stabilized where it should be and where it has been historically and the same on homeowners. So we feel very good about the underlying margin trends in both of those businesses. As we've been saying historically, we manage this very disciplined. We keep on top of loss cost and we keep on top of expense cost and we manage it on a micro basis for the benefit of the overall system. So we manage those in each geography and each micro-geography and the result of that is a systemic result that looks the way you see on these charts with positive long-term trends. From the overall economy, if you look at our current severity, we haven't seen that much of an impact from the inflationary trends. Obviously, there's some. But really, it's been relatively mild and relatively benign. Most of the severity fluctuations that we've seen have been the result of age of closures, geographic mix, policy limit shifts and things like I discussed earlier about just backlog of third-party subro demands and things like that. So, so far, the trends have been relatively benign. That being said, it's 1 of the reasons that we have to stay on top of taking rate, it's 1 of the reasons we thought it's so important to point out that we have continued to take rate on the Auto side even though it was masked a little bit by the Ontario rate decrease. We believe it's essential that we take rate as needed on a moderate basis consistently across the business. It's less disruptive to customers, it's less disruptive to the agency force, it improves retention and it allows us to stay ahead of any inflationary trends that might occur. Thomas J. Wilson: Let me provide a point of clarification on these 2 charts on Page 7 as well. Obviously, 2 drivers of profitability are price and loss cost, and we've shown them to you because we think they're relevant. Unfortunately, I think, sometimes, it shifts the focus to just price as a tool to manage profitability. And let me expound on what Matt just said and give you the example of homeowners. So risk selection, product design, claims, performances, are all equally important to profitability. So if you look at homeowners over the last 5 years and you look at our cumulative price increases relative to our competitors, you're not really that much different at the end of this 5-year period. That said, we took a whole bunch of other actions, which give us the confidence that what we've done has made it sustainable. So for example, we used to have it as peak 7.8 million policies, we now have a little over 6 million. That's 1.8 million down. We're down 1.2 million just since 2009. What we do is went through re-underwrote the book, decided that those risker underpriced pieces of business we were no longer going to insure. We moved those to somebody else. We Improved. Matt's got a whole new set of inspection processes going on in terms of the way we look at new business. We obviously use sophisticated technology in claims. And then, they've redesigned the product in House & Home. I think, you're in what percentage of the country it is? Matthew E. Winter: We're in about... Steven E. Shebik: 31 states and it's a growing percentage of the book of business. Matthew E. Winter: It's about 12% of our overall book, 85% of our new business writings. Thomas J. Wilson: So all of that stuff is underneath that story. So when we're -- I would encourage you to think about it, we have to look at these charts and show you price, but price is not the only tool we have to manage profitability. Matt was talking about that system. It has all of those tools available to it. And the strength of our execution is in being able to have a leadership that knows how to manage that well. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : That's very comprehensive. Second question is on Encompass. It looks like that's the only segment you have year-over-year deterioration in terms of underlying combined ratio. I see that you're taking pricing action, as evidenced in the PIF growth slowing down. Could you talk a little bit more about the competition in the independent agency channel? Unknown Executive : In Encompass, we're focused, as you know, on the mass affluent, and so we compete day-to-day with Met, Hanover, Chubb, AIG and Crestbrook. Right now, we see that it's competitive, certainly, but it's not irrational from a pricing perspective. We're still seeing really solid growth on our package policy, we had 10% quarter-over-quarter on our package policy growth, which now makes up the majority of our book. And we see more room, more elasticity in Auto. So if you look at Auto, quarter-over-quarter, we're up almost 2 points in retention. So that tells me we have more room to increase margin in the back half of the year and we plan to do that to get our underlying in line. With regard to deterioration you're seeing on the overall underlying of 2 points, you have some non-cat quoted weather in there, we had a really tough quarter in terms of weather and you have non-cat quoted weather, and you see the impact of a onetime rather sizable premium refund that's driving some of that, too. So all those things combined are driving that underlying. But overall, we still see room for margin expansion in the back half of the year. And if you look at the investor supplement, you'll see that we take most of our rates in the back half of the year on Encompass. And so, you'll see us earn an even more rate on Auto and Home as the year progresses. And we think we have room to do that. Thomas J. Wilson: Why don't we do 1 more question? Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Back to Allstate Financial, the results were just excellent and it's not just on expenses. I know it's the spread of net investment income to interest credit after I take out the impact of Lincoln Benefit, it's also growing and the benefits to premium ratio has been declining. There's a lot of good stuff going on there. Can you sort of talk about not just the efficiencies, but actually the underlying profitability of the business, I guess, being generated, what's happening? Steven E. Shebik: Yes, I'm happy to do that. I do feel good about the overall results at Allstate Financial. And the operating income, obviously, at $165 million, given the size of our business today, is a terrific result. We're hitting on a lot of cylinders, as you pointed out. It isn't just expenses. I think, benefit spread continues to be nice and stable and we're seeing good results on that year-over-year. Where we're seeing a really great result year-over-year is investment spread. So it looks, if you look at the reported numbers, we're up $12 million in investment spread. If you take out LBL, it was actually $68 million. And so we've talked about that in the past with the investment strategy we've taken, we are hoping for higher returns, we're expecting higher returns, it will come with some volatility and we're prepared for that. But at the moment, the investment income, benefit spread, expenses, everything has worked well for us and that's why you see the results you're seeing. Thomas J. Wilson: Okay. Thank you all. I know there's number of calls today. So I'll close it off where we began. This quarter's results show the benefits of both having a focused strategy and solid execution. The net is growth at attractive returns. Thank you very much, we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Pat Macellaro. Please go ahead. Patrick Macellaro : Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Allstate's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. To begin, Tom Wilson, Steve Shebik and I will provide some color on our results for the quarter, and then we'll answer your questions. We realize there are other calls this morning so we've shortened our comments. [Operator Instructions]. Yesterday we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the third quarter and posted the slides we'll use this morning. These are all available on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2013, our 10-Q for the third quarter, the slides and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release and on our website. We're recording this call and a replay will be available following its conclusion. I'll be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. And now I'll turn it over to Tom, for his thoughts on the quarter. Thomas J. Wilson: Well, good morning, everybody. We appreciate your interest and investment in Allstate. I'm going to start by providing an overview of the third quarter results, in particular how they tie to our strategy and our 2014 operating priorities. Then Pat and Steve will go -- provide some more context around results, then our leadership team will be here to answer your questions. So in the room with us are Matt Winter, who leads Allstate personal lines; Don Civgin, who's responsible for Allstate Financial and Insurance; Kathy Mabe, who leads Business to Business; Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. So let's begin with Slide 2. If you -- put simply, Allstate had a really good quarter this time. We continue to proactively take action, which is to enhance our competitive position, execute our strategy and deliver our current results. And while not everything is where it ultimately needs to be, most of the trends are in line with expectations. The strategy of focusing on unique value propositions for different customer segments is working. Growth increased, as we added almost 800,000 Property-Liability policies in force and increased annual net written premiums by $1.4 billion over the trailing 12 months. Financial results for the quarter were also excellent. Net income was $750 million for the third quarter. As you can see, that's in the table on the bottom, which is significantly higher than last year's third quarter. But you remember last year, we reported the initial loss estimate on the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life in 2013 results. Operating income for the third quarter was $1.39 per share. The Property-Liability business generated good combined ratios in aggregate, despite catastrophe losses and investments in growth. Allstate Financial had good growth in the voluntary workplace benefits business with policies increasing almost 8% in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Allstate Financial returns were up, which reflects higher investment yields, lower expenses and a declining capital base. We also made progress on our 5 2014 operating priorities and delivered strong cash returns to our shareholders. If you go to Slide 3, that breaks out the Property-Liability operating results for the 4 customer segments. Starting at top of the slide, Property-Liability policies in force increased 2.4% and net written premiums were 4.9% higher than the prior year quarter. Overall, profitability was strong with the Property-Liability recorded combined ratio of 93.5, which included 7.1 points of Cat losses. The underlying combined ratio for the third quarter was 86.1, which brings that year-to-date total then for the first 9 months to 86.4, which is better than the full year outlook range of 87 to 89 that we provided in February. The Property-Liability results by customer segment are shown on the bottom half of the page. If you start with the largest segment, served by the Allstate agencies, that's in the lower left, profitability was good across all products and Matt's team continues to execute a comprehensive profitable growth plan. We continue to have broad-based auto policy growth, which is 2.6% higher than the prior year. There was also a modest increase of about 0.1% in homeowners, and other personalized policies were 1.7% higher than the prior year. Esurance, which is in the lower right, had policy growth of 14% over the prior year quarter, which is a decline from last year's growth rate, reflecting the profit improvement initiatives. Growth investments continue to have a negative impact on the recorded combined ratio. And as we discussed in prior quarters, Don's team is focused on reducing the underlying loss ratio, which at 75.3 was about 2 points better than the prior year. The lifetime profitability of growth at this loss ratio is above our cost of capital, so we remain committed to increasing market share in this segment. Encompass, in the upper left, has slowed growth, particularly of its packaged [ph] policy offering as they expand profit improvement initiatives. Encompass' path to growth under Kathy will be first to improve profitability. Answer Financial, in the upper right, sold nonproprietary policies through the web and call centers. Nonproprietary premiums increased almost 10% over the prior year quarter. So if we go to Slide 4, our 5 2014 operating priorities are shown there. And since we just discussed both growth and profit, I'll focus on the remaining priorities. We experienced another good quarter of investment returns. The total portfolio return in the quarter was 0.4%, but it's 4.7% for the first 9 months of 2014, reflecting the proactive approach taken by Judy's team. Net investment income, however, was lower than the prior year quarter, as strong limited partnership income was not enough to offset the impact of the $12 billion reduction in the portfolio because of the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. Modernizing the operating model will improve the customer value proposition by enhancing customer service and lowering cost. This includes simplifying technology applications and using continuous improvement to improve effectiveness and efficiency. We also are looking to build long-term growth platforms. So to increase growth in our largest customer segment, we're building on the existing comprehensive growth plans by helping Allstate agents become trusted advisers and expanding into more local markets. Our broad product line, household focus and innovation by Good Hands Roadside and Drivewise further enhance those customer relationships. The Drivewise telematics offering, we've expanded that to include a mobile phone application, which is now in 16 states, so we can compare the utilization of that method to the devices that are tied to the car's OBD ports. Esurance's advertising messages of insurance for the modern world and 7.5 minutes, not 15 minutes, has further strengthened the brand for self-serve customers. Our broader product line, geographical expansion and more sophisticated pricing will also support market share gains. So in summary, Allstate had strong results across a number of fronts in the quarter. The strategy to better meet the unique needs of customers and proactively manage both investments and capital continues to serve our shareholders well. So let me turn it over to Pat. Patrick Macellaro : Thanks, Tom. I'll begin by reviewing the Property-Liability highlights on Slide 5. Beginning with the chart on the top of this page, Property-Liability earned premium of $7.3 billion in the third quarter, was 4.8% higher than the third quarter of 2013. Recorded combined ratio of 93.5 increased 3.5 points versus the third quarter of 2013 driven by increased catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio was 86.1 for the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date result to 86.4. Net investment income for the Property-Liability segment increased 11.3% from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by limited partnership income. Property-Liability operating income in the third quarter was $553 million, 19.3% lower than the third quarter of 2013, which, as you may recall, was a very benign quarter in terms of weather. During the third quarter, the annual review of discontinued lines and coverage reserve levels led to an increase of $102 million in reserves, most of which pertain to asbestos liabilities. This increased the Property-Liability recorded combined ratio by 1.4 points for the third quarter. Reserves were increased by $133 million in the third quarter of 2013 as a result of last year's annual review. The chart on the lower left shows net written premium and policy-in-force growth rates for Allstate Protection. The red line shows the continued positive policy growth trend that began in the second quarter of 2013. Policies in force have grown by 2.4% from last year's third quarter and 1.8% from year-end 2013. The exhibit to the right of this chart highlights the Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratio trends, as well as results by brand. Esurance's underlying loss ratio of 75.3 for the third quarter of 2014 is also shown to isolate the impact of ongoing profit-improvement actions from the impact of growth investments. Moving to Page 6, we show the components of premium and policy growth by brand. Focusing on the Allstate brand in the upper left chart, policies increased by 572,000 in the third quarter, which is 1.9% higher than the third quarter of 2013, driven by both favorable new business and retention trends. The Allstate brand grew net written premium by 4.5% in the third quarter versus the prior year quarter as average premiums continued to increase. Total growth in net written premium was driven by a 4.9% increase in the Allstate brand auto and a 2.9% increase in Allstate brand homeowners compared with third quarter of 2013. Moving to the chart on the right-hand side, you can see the policy-in-force growth trends for Allstate brand auto and homeowners going back to 2005. Current results compare favorably to recent history due to having substantially completed the repositioning of the homeowners business. In this quarter, Allstate brand auto policies rose by 504,000 or 2.6% from the prior year quarter. Allstate brand homeowners rose by a modest 5,000 policies from the prior year quarter, which is indicative of continued progress in leveraging this product as a competitive advantage versus monoline auto carriers. Allstate brand auto -- Allstate brand policy growth is geographically broad-based and reflects both better customer retention and new business sales. There are currently 42 states growing Allstate brand auto policies and 21 states growing Allstate brand homeowner policies versus the prior year. Esurance's read of premium and policy growth in the lower left continues to slow due to ongoing pricing and underwriting actions underway to ensure a long-term profitable growth as well as Esurance's increasing size. Total Esurance premium grew by 14%, policies in force grew by 14.1% in the third quarter compared with the third quarter of 2013. Spending on expansion contributed approximately 2 points to the combined ratio in the third quarter. Encompass policy-in-force growth, highlighted in the lower right, also continues to slow, reflecting actions taken to ensure acceptable long-term returns. Net written premium growth of 4.3% in the third quarter compared with third quarter of 2013 includes the impact of higher average premiums that are the result of the profit improvement plan. Slide 7 highlights Allstate brand auto and homeowner underlying margin trends. The charts on the left show Allstate brand auto and home recorded and underlying combined ratio trends, while the charts on the right show the components of the quarterly underwriting combined ratio. As you can see on the charts on the left-hand side, while there's volatility in the recorded combined ratio trends from quarter-to-quarter due to catastrophes, the long-term underlying combined ratio results have been both very good and stable for auto insurance and steadily improving for homeowners. The Allstate brand auto under its [ph] current premium continued to increase in the quarter, up 1.7% from the prior year quarter. Premium increases have been improved in 35 states so far in 2014, reflecting an organizational focus on maintaining margins by making frequent adjustments based on actual results. The underlying losses and expenses per policy increased slightly in the third quarter by 1/10 of 1% compared with the third quarter of 2013. This resulted from a lower frequency of claims and expected increase in severity of losses, along with the benefit from the lower expense ratio. We experienced similar results in the third quarter for Allstate brand homeowners. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy reflect prior year quarter and average earned premium continued to increase, although at a slowing rate, as more states approach rate adequacy. Allstate brand homeowners underlying combined ratio was 60 in the third quarter. We're continuing to take rate increases and make underwriting and product changes as needed to continue to keep pace with loss trends and maintain the underlying combined ratio in both of these lines. Now I'll turn it over to Steve, to cover Allstate financial, investments and capital management. Steven E. Shebik: Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 8, our strategy is for Allstate Financial to become more strategically integrated with the Allstate brand's customer value proposition. Allstate Life and Retirement has been refocused on the Allstate agencies, but the integration in the Allstate brand customer value proposition will require a multi-year effort. The chart on the bottom of this page highlights operating income by quarter, including and excluding the impact of the sold Lincoln Benefit Life business. Operating income for the quarter was $125 million, 1.6% lower than the third quarter of 2013, but higher when excluding LBL results from the prior year. Operating income return on equity has continued to improve given our efforts to focus the business; a lower cost structure; strong investment income over the past 4 quarters, reflecting limited partnership income; and the $1.2 billion return of capital by the Allstate Life Insurance Company over the past 12 months. So that estimated historical results with Lincoln Benefit Life are provided on our third quarter 2014 10-Q and the investor supplement to provide you with further context. On Slide 9, in the top left graph, you can see the composition of the investment portfolio and the impact of the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life, which reduced the size of the portfolio by $12 billion. We are taking a measured approach over time to shift the portfolio composition from fixed income assets to equity and other assets, where returns are driven primarily by idiosyncratic performance. Our equity and owned portfolio is lower compared to the prior year end primarily due to the reclassification of tax credit investments to other assets and the sale of approximately $300 million of limited partnership positions. Our total portfolio return, presented at the top right, was 0.4% for the third quarter as investment income of 1% was partially offset by lower fixed income and equity valuations. You can see the valuation impact varies from quarter-to-quarter, while the income yield has remained relatively constant. Total return for the first 9 months of 2014 was 4.7%. The lower half of the slide provides the investment income and yield for the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial portfolios, each of which comprise approximately half of the portfolio. This approximate equal split reflects the strategic decision to deploy capital out of Allstate Financial. The Property-Liability portfolio in the lower left graph shows the interest-bearing yield has stabilized after our 2013 rate risk reduction actions and illustrates the variability in income that may result from limited partnership and other equity investments. The Allstate Financial portfolio, in the lower right graph, has a more stable yield due to the longer duration of these investments and the limited reinvestment activity. The decline in quarterly income versus the prior year is due to the sale of LBL. Allstate Financial's portfolio has been reduced through a variety of actions that resulted in a decline of total invested assets from a peak of $78 billion in the first quarter of 2007 to $39 billion in the third quarter of 2014. Slide 10 provides an overview of how our capital structure has changed over time. On the left-hand side of the page, you can see the capital structure at the end of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2014, and the shift from predominantly senior debt to include more hybrid debt and preferred stock, increasing both our strategic and financial flexibility. With the repayment of $650 million of senior debt in August, the capital restructuring plan we started early last year is complete. That said, we constantly evaluate alternative sources of capital to lower our cost or decrease volatility in order to create additional shareholder value. Shareholders received cash returns of over $1 billion in the third quarter, as we repurchased $926 million of common stock and paid $122 million in common stock dividends. Through the first 9 months of the year, total common shareholder cash returns were $2.42 billion, including quarterly dividends, the completion of one $750 million accelerated share repurchase program, the initiation of a second $750 million accelerated share repurchase program and open market purchases. We have now completed just over 75% of the $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization approved in February in about 40% of the authorized 18-month repurchase period. Book value per common share reached $48.28, increasing 6.6% since year end and 11% since September 30 of last year. Operating income return on equity was a strong 13% in the third quarter on a trailing 12-month basis, but lower than the full year 2013 return of 14.5%, reflecting the impact of higher catastrophe losses in the first 9 months of this year and a higher equity base. As I mentioned last quarter, much of the increased equity is a result of the positive impact of the 2013 change to pension and retiree benefits and plan assumption changes. Now let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : First question, can you -- Tom, could you talk a little bit about the other personal lines business? That roughly $2.5 billion of premium. What were the trends in that line up from a profitability perspective? Thomas J. Wilson: Sure, let me provide some overall context and then Matt can give you some specifics by line. But first, as you know, in that customer segment, where they want local advice and branded products, that is -- that's served by the Allstate Agency. They want to buy most of their stuff from the same person. The logic is that I don't want to have to have a relationship with somebody to buy auto insurance and home and boat and PUP policies and renters policies. So we try to -- we do offer them a broad range of stuff. And we have -- Matt's team has been working on more of a household focus, which includes those policies. So we've, of course, sold those for years. I think we have about 5 million policies in total in force, when you look at them in total. Matt can take you through sort of both the growth trends, where we've had some good success, and profitability. Matthew E. Winter: Thanks, Tom. Thanks, first of all, for asking about the other personal lines. We often get through call without ever mentioning these. And as Tom mentioned, we're trying to incorporate all the products a customer might need within the Allstate Agency value proposition. And so we've had an increased emphasis on the other personal lines products. As you know, there's a wide group of products grouped within this category, and we do, do the breakdown on the -- in the investor sup on both Pages 15 and 30 that gives you some of the net written premium trends and the policy-in-force trends. What you see on the profit side is we've had a fair amount of margin actions this year in the landlord, manufactured home and the PUP areas. And so that has suppressed some of our IIF growth, because of those margin actions in those lines. Most of our item-in-force growth has come from renters and condo, which are where we need them to be from a profitability standpoint. We did have some decline in involuntary auto, as more companies are willing to take on more of those drivers. That somewhat dampened our growth. But overall, when we look at our other personal lines products, other than the work that we have ongoing in landlord, manufactured home and PUP, we feel very good about the profitability, very good about the growth prospects in all those individual product areas. Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Great. And could you provide sort of an underlying or just an indication of kind of where that business is running maybe relative to auto and home? Thomas J. Wilson: Well, you can see that on Slide 3, Mike. The combined -- the recorded combined ratio for other personal lines for this quarter was 85, that compares to 81 for home and 93 for auto. And as Matt pointed out, there's a wide range of products, so the capital under those products varies significantly. [indiscernible] returns. Matthew E. Winter: You might also look, Mike, Page 23 of the investor sup, shows the loss ratio, cat ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio for that category. Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Got it, great. And then just in terms of the homeowners lines, so now that's ticking on the plus side for the first time in a while, and the new issued apps [ph] seem to be moving in the right direction. Can you kind of talk about what you expect there? I mean, do you still see opportunities now for PIF growth to move further into positive territory? And what are the factors driving that? And how should we think about the interaction between that and auto if you look to get more on the offensive there? Thomas J. Wilson: I'll provide a longer term perspective and Matt can talk about -- well, his current growth plans and the profit improvement plans because while we're happy with the overall combined ratio where it is today, this is -- it's a country with 50 states and -- and a couple of territories, and so we have to do things differently in each of those and so they're not all perfect. But if you -- there is -- we put in a slightly longer view. If you really look at homeowners in total, I think, it peaked, Mike, about 7.8 million policies and it's a little above 6 million now. And it's really been coming down since the '06 period of time, where we started taking pretty drastic action in, at the time, relatively narrowly focused cat areas, being Florida and Louisiana, a few places. Then as the weather got worse in '08 and '09, we expanded that activity by both increasing prices and, as importantly, our re-underwriting the book and making sure we like the individual properties we had taken risk on. And you can see, the business kept coming down on an overall items-in-force level. That does -- auto does track with it. If you look at our -- the growth rate of those 2, they track together. That said, we weren't willing in the depths of the -- getting smaller in the homeowners business to give ourselves a complete out for that because there are, of course, monoline auto companies that grow and we felt that we should be able to grow as well. It's a little harder though when you're telling somebody, \"I'm not going to insure your house. Please keep your auto with me, then please give me your auto if you don't have it.\" So they do trend together, but they are also separate. And so auto has had higher growth rates over the last couple of years than home has. Home has finally ticked positive. It's 5,000 on 6 million. That doesn't count as sustainable growth. So Matt can talk about what they're doing to get sustainable growth out of that business and how it turns into a competitive advantage for us relative to both the local advice and branded Allstate segment, and -- but we won't go there right now. But you also know we're adding this to the Esurance platform as well so that they can be in that segment. Matthew E. Winter: Thanks, Tom, and Mike, thanks for the question. As you noted, this is the first quarter since 2006 that we grew items on a year-over-year basis. And while it's by a small number of policies, it's pretty widespread, widespread geographically and widespread in terms of its drivers, being both favorable new business and retention. As Pat noted in his opening remarks, we now have 21 states that are growing year-over-year. New business is 12% above prior year, and we actually have 36 states with higher new business levels than last year. As we've talked about on previous calls, we've been putting in House & Home. House & Home growth has been higher than our countrywide average. And as we've also discussed, House & Home gives us some benefits on the profitability side in that it normally goes in rate adequate when we launch it. And due to its product design, tends to be more stable and tends to require less rate. And so it gives us a competitive advantage in terms of stability in the marketplace. On the retention side, retention in homeowners continues to improve. We're now up 1.2 percentage points since 2012, and we have 38 states that are above prior year retention levels. What's interesting to us is that while we monitor both first and subsequent retention, and both are showing favorable trends, we've noticed that subsequent retention has now reached its highest level since 2005. So we feel quite good about the new business growth. We feel quite good about the retention trends and we feel quite good about the profitability of that business to enable us to maintain that trend line. So we believe we have more room to go. We did have some benefit of opening up in some PML areas that had previously been closed, where we figured diversification benefit was worth allowing small policy growth there. But by no means do we feel like we've capped out. We think we have geographic areas within the United States that are under-penetrated compared to what our market potential is. And we think we have room to grow as we expand our agency footprint in some of those areas. So we're cautiously optimistic about the future. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Capital. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Question on Allstate Financial. Where is the expense structure relative to where you want to be without LBL? You mentioned expenses, I think, is bullet 4 or 5, as a priority, but what sort of timing should we expect on getting the expenses rightsized to the smaller operation? Don Civgin : Bob, it's Don. Thanks for the question, and thanks for noticing that the expenses are down. Sometimes, it's thankless work, but I appreciate you pointing it out. The Allstate Financial strategy, which we've been consistently following for the last 4 or 5 years, really results in a business that's smaller and far better aligned with the Allstate customer value proposition. Part of that -- and Steve mentioned how much smaller the investment assets are. A lot of that happened actually over the course of the last 4 years or so, even though we pointed out a 7-year timeframe. And so that has put a lot of pressure on the expense structure. We're down this year about 22% in Life and Retirement business. I'll exclude Allstate Benefits, because they're growing. But in the Allstate Life and Retirement business we're down about 22% in expenses from last year's quarter. I expect those numbers to continue coming down some. But we're getting to the point where we're about the right size -- or the expense structure is about the right size for the company. What we really want to do now is make sure that we're focused on supporting the customer, the Allstate customer, through the Allstate agencies and generating some growth for the company. I think that's going to take a bit longer to get through the transition with Lincoln Benefit Life. But the expense piece of it has come down nicely, and we still have a little bit more to go. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : And the follow-up is on auto. With gas sub $3 in a lot of areas, are you pricing for increased frequency yet? Or you're waiting to see what will happen? Thomas J. Wilson: Okay, Bob, Bob, I love the follow-up from the life to auto. But I love you anyway. Matt can talk specifically about all these, of course. Frequency has all kinds of components in it, right? It's got miles driven, it's got who drives the car, it's got -- that's affected by a lot things including gas prices. The biggest driver historically, from our analysis, which is kind of hard to get between that, is really on the economic growth. So people are working, unemployment rates are down, economic activity is up, people are going to restaurants, they're driving places. And so as you look at the progress, and of course, unemployment and economic activity has trended up for the last 3 or 4 years. Matt's team has reflected that into the results, and you see we've been able to maintain ratios. Gas prices may have an impact on mileage driving. And we track it. It's not as close, right? Because gas prices aren't really that significant a cost that they keep people from driving. So if you're paying $4 a gallon and you suddenly pay $3 a gallon, even if you're getting 10 miles per gallon, you're saving $0.10 a mile. It's not really a barrier to people going places. That said, you tend to get more like summer driving vacations and stuff like that. I would just say Matt's team has proven their ability to micro-target that stuff and drive it in a way there. So Matt, if you want to make comment about frequency and profitability? Matthew E. Winter: Sure. Thanks, Tom. I don't really have much to add as far as the gas price impact. As Tom said, it's something we'll watch and watch carefully. But we don't expect it to be a core driver. That being said, our frequency so far has been extremely favorable to prior year. It's within our historical ranges, it's broad geographically. So our frequency trends are -- have been good. We stay on top of them, as Tom says. This is a national business managed very locally. And so even if the change in gas prices drives behavior and miles driven in some small geographies, it will be geographically specific. It won't be widespread. And so we'll manage it that way, and we'll continue to do what the company has been quite good at doing. As you see on page 7 of our presentation, we have a pretty long-term history of managing our margins well and keeping an eye on both frequency and severity and reacting accordingly. So it's something to watch, but not something to obsess over. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division : The first topic I want to cover is on reinsurance cost. Reinsurance costs appear to be coming down pretty dramatically over the course of this year and probably into next year. Could you update us on your reinsurance protection strategy in terms of whether you expect those savings to fall through to the bottom line? Or perhaps you've used a portion of those savings to buy more coverage? Thomas J. Wilson: Steve, do you want to talk about the [indiscernible]. Jay, we redid those programs in June. It was just -- even if current -- if pricing is lower today than it was in June, we put our plan in place. It was a multi-year plan. Steven E. Shebik: So Jay, this is Steve. As Tom said, we put in place a multi-year plan, the core reinsurance is a 3-year plan rolling 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. And this year, well, actually last year and going into this year, we started issuing catastrophe bonds again, which we had not done for about 5 or 6 years. This year in particular, we issued over $1 billion and it was in excess, I think, of $2.75 billion if I remember it correctly. So the core part of the program is really subject to the changing pricing in the reinsurance market. But it would only be -- kick in about 1/3 at a time each year going forward. And as you know, our pricing is adjusted for reinsurance costs, so that kind of bleeds into the pricing over a period of time. We did take the chance -- opportunity this year for the lower -- with the lower prices in the core reinsurance market to buy more coverage up top, so -- and also at the bottom. So for those several years, we've had a first event $750 million retention, we lowered that to $500 million this year, and we increased the amount of coverage on the topside of the program. So we have the best coverage, I believe, we've ever had. And we have multiple sources, both the traditional reinsurance program and the catastrophe bonds that are 4- and 5-year maturity type bonds. So we're covered over a longer period of time. Thomas J. Wilson: Jay, this is Tom, maybe to take it up a level in terms of capital management. We kind of look at reinsurance as just capital at this point. And so Steve talked about how we use it to reduce volatility. We, of course, are trying to be proactive everywhere in the capital structure. So we put a bunch -- as Steve pointed out, we took a bunch of debt out, put on preferred, put on hybrids, which lowers our cost of capital and puts us in a really strong financial position. As the market develops, I think what you're seeing in reinsurance pricing is really the growth of -- the increased interest in insurance-related investments and assets. And so we think you'll continue to see new forms of alternative capital being developed, which will enable us to either lower reinsurance costs, take advantage of other things in the capital structure or find other ways to lower our cost of capital or take volatility out of the business. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division : That's helpful. On the capital management front, Tom or Steve, I find it interesting that Allstate appears to be moving towards share buybacks and dividends being in excess of annual operating earnings. There's only a few companies in the property-casualty sector that did that -- or have done that so far, mostly on the commercial line side, but Allstate doesn't have the pricing pressure they're facing. So can you update us a bit in terms of level of magnitude and in terms of what you're thinking on the pace of buybacks and dividends relative to earnings? Thomas J. Wilson: We don't -- I know some of the banks, Jay, do it that way. They say 80% of their earnings. We don't do it that way. We obviously look at it relative to how much capital we have, which is dependent on earnings. But we look at how -- for example, some of the things, we got rid of -- we've reduced, as Steve pointed out, we've reduced the size of the Allstate Life and Retirement balance sheet by about $40 billion, which is equal to some life insurance companies. And so the capital that supported that, we either can deploy in growing our property casualty business or in giving it to shareholders. We -- included in that was the sale of Lincoln Benefit. So that's been factored in. We don't forecast where we'll go after we get done with this share repurchase program. But Steve's been very aggressive in buying back the current shares because we have plenty of capital, and we're feeling good about returns. And we do want to keep that capital and have our ROE go down. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Hall from Wells Fargo. John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I have a question starting with Allstate Financial. In the quarter, there was a fair amount of difference between the third quarter and the second quarter operating earnings. I was wondering if we're at a level that we can start to think of building off of the third quarter going forward. Thomas J. Wilson: I'll give my view. Steve and Don may have their own views. I think this quarter looks more like the future than last quarter, John. Yes, I think they're going to agree. Don Civgin : No one is answering, so I think we all agree. Thomas J. Wilson: We're not -- we don't do forecasts by line or by company or something like that. But you had some increased limited partnership returns last quarter, the second quarter of this year than this year. Now I will point out, I know there's been some questions from people about the volatility about limited partnership returns. And yes, it is true that limited partnership returns are more volatile. But that's specifically why we break them out for you, and it's also specifically why we do it. And so if you think about that, our investment philosophy is get a good risk adjusted for return, not to try and optimize any given quarter. And then we -- the return -- we look for attractive returns. And because these investments are volatile, they tend to get higher returns. And it also puts another -- with the idiosyncratic or the asset-specific concentration on investment results, it puts some diversification into the portfolio rather than just the market. So it's a good reason for that standpoint. And also if you look at our overall volatility, we've reduced volatility in the investment portfolio because of interest rates. You see that in lower operating income, but if you look at how we've shortened the duration in the Property-Liability portfolio, that's reduced volatility. While this injects a little more volatility, we think it's volatility that is higher return than just keeping interest rates -- our duration out there. So we thought the trade between the 2 and the risk return. And then if you look at the volatility across the company, and go up a level, while I know this makes it harder for you all to forecast what that -- the limited partnership returns will be, and then hence, what Allstate Financial's returns will be. If you look at the volatility in the overall company P&L, we have plenty of places. We've have plenty of volatility and this is just an uncorrelated piece of volatility. So we have catastrophe volatility, frequency volatility and then the partnership volatility. But we spike it out so you can get it, but we think overall, it's exactly the right thing to be doing with our investments, even though it creates a little bit of confusion as to, is your run rate 150 or 125. John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Great. No, that all make sense. And you sort of got to my follow-up, which had to do with whether you're making any changes to the investment portfolio allocation towards these types of investments. Judith Pepple Greffin : So this is Judy. And yes, we are changing our allocation towards these types of investments. As Tom just said, we like this trade off versus interest rates currently and, frankly, into the future. But we're doing that at a measured pace. There's no denying that the market is pretty fully priced in terms of valuations. So we're looking at the space, we like the space over the long term. It's just finding the right investments for us, and those idiosyncratic investments that we think will deliver higher returns again, over the long-term. Thomas J. Wilson: And Judy, you're highly diversified in the space you're in right? So if... Judith Pepple Greffin : Yes. Within the overall portfolio, we're highly diversified; and then this part of the portfolio, we're highly diversified as well. And you can see that in the Q, we break that out. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research : Two quick questions, the first question is on loss-cost trends. Can you talk about what you might be seeing in Personal Injury Protection, auto severity trends, concerning the fact that one of your competitors pointed out to a 17% increase recently? Thomas J. Wilson: Well, of course you know PIF coverage is in about 5 states. I'm not sure what their 17% was, if that was one state or across the country. It seems like a pretty -- it seemed high to me if it was across all 5 states. If it was us, we'd be really worried about that. I don't know if they are or not, and I don't know who you are talking about at this point, but I'll soon find out. Matt, do you want to talk -- it's really a relatively highly focused, but important question, because those states tend to be pretty large states, being New York, Florida, Michigan, anyway, Matthew? Matthew E. Winter: So as Tom said, I'm not sure specifically who you're referring to. So I can't comment on what they might have said. Obviously, PIF and BI are things that we watch constantly. They tend to be somewhat volatile. And they move around and bounce around. And if they're not managed carefully, they can get out of control. We watch them carefully and we react in a variety of different ways, depending upon the geography. In some cases, it's pricing action, it's -- in other cases, it's underwriting actions. In other cases, it's managing where we're growing and where we're not. And so we'll continue to manage those 2 coverages fairly aggressively. We're not seeing anything get out of control from our perspective, I can say that. We're seeing normal volatility that we would expect. But we're not seeing anything out of control. Thomas J. Wilson: I would -- a couple of things I would look at too if -- on the subject [ph] without trying to [indiscernible], but I'd first look at their size of the book, if they have a small book. I'd also look at what happened the prior year. That -- as Matt pointed out, that PIP line could be highly volatile. You get some pretty good cases in there, and all of a sudden, the quarter-over-quarter looks really wild, but the absolute level looks okay in the long term. So I don't know whether something has a problem or not. There's also the claim procedures and the schedules in which we operate. And sometimes you can't control that, which is -- so they'll put a schedule in to say chiropractors get a certain amount of money, and you have to pay according to that. So it doesn't mean that the company's not well managed, it just means you're doing what you're required to do. But the way in which you manage that is exactly what Matt said, which is you're keeping -- paying attention to it and either you're controlling your cost and making sure people get the right amount of money or you're changing your pricing. And as he pointed out, we were -- we have -- I think, when people look at our business on profitability, they tend to take a commercial lines perspective and look at sort of price and loss cost, and assume it's all about price. We really have a system. And you really have to think about the system, how it works at a granular level, which makes adjustments all the time. And it's that system that's generated the good combined ratios in auto insurance for a decade. And it's managing and leading that system which we have to do to make sure we get good returns. Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research : The only other question I had was going back to the discussion on telematics and I think you mentioned the mobile app is in 15 states. What I was wondering was, why not skip the OBD or the app step and work directly with car manufacturers? We all are talking about the connected car concept. Why -- what would preclude you from working out some sort of arrangement with, let's say, the big 3 car manufacturers and installing something on those vehicles which allows the customer to get a code from Allstate. Thomas J. Wilson: It's a good question and the answer is nothing, but it wouldn't be comprehensive, in part because the average age of the fleet is 11 years. And so there's a whole bunch of people out there driving that we'd like to offer them the opportunity to get more sophisticated pricing and a better driving experience now as opposed to waiting until they buy a new car. So we're actively in conversations with everybody. And that range of potential participants in the connected car, obviously, includes the OEs, the auto manufacturers, but it also includes the telcos. Some of the telcos are interested, some of the other connected customer technology companies are interested. So we're active in all the fronts. We'd like to think of this as a tremendous opportunity for our company. And it will evolve, and so we're trying to put as many oars in the water as we can so that we at least stay with the tide, if not get ahead of it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : So I thought I'd ask a big picture question about Esurance. I'm wondering if you can walk us through how you guys are thinking about the economics of ad spend, really rough numbers. It kind of looks like you spent maybe $500 million, $600 million on advertising since you've bought the business. You've driven a similar amount of new business growth. And so I'm curious on how you think about or we should think about what the returns of that investment would be. And big pictures, is this something where you should be advertising more if you could scale up the organization and you can handle the level of growth? Thomas J. Wilson: I'll give you a strategic answer and Don can jump into the specifics, and we look at it both ways, Josh. So certainly, we think it is an important growth element in our plan. So we -- to a certain extent, if you go way up, what we've done is we now have a diversified set of growth opportunities with -- inside the Property-Liability space. We've traded some of that off for diversification and growth opportunities by reducing the size of our life business. So we used to have -- so we have -- and we had this opportunity with a highly focused customer value proposition to go at that self-serve space and really take on GEICO and Progressive Direct head on with, in our words, out self-serve them. And so that's why we talk about 7.5 minutes, not 15. We also are good at that. The reason that diversification by customer segment works is because it's something we're really good at, both pricing, settling claims, and all that has turned out to be true in aggregate for us. I think the business is up about not quite double yet, we're about 80% bigger than when we bought it. And you're right, we've invested a lot of money in it. We also think we've enhanced the underlying processes, not all of which you see in the current P&L, because we continue to invest aggressively in, like, rolling out homeowners, motorcycle, renters. I think that, Don, that's eaten up a couple of points of profit just last quarter. So we continue to invest in that. And we think it's an opportunity for us to compete more directly and stop them from coming to compete with the -- in the multiline customers in the lower left. And so we like the portfolio approach it gives us. So that said, we like the deal, we're glad we paid a lot of money for it. And we're even happier that it's turned out to be growing and we're going to make money on it. As it relates to the individual annual amount, that gets balanced a couple of ways. One is we look at our overall profitability of the company. And I like there to be a balance between that. So while we certainly could spend more money, I don't want to put too much pressure on other parts of the business that also have growth opportunities. We've got lots of places we can grow. Matt's adding agencies, Kathy's growing the benefits business. We've got plenty of places we can grow. So we try to balance it in the overall portfolio of growth opportunities. And then Don looks specifically at the returns and the efficiency curve, so to speak. So Don, you might want to talk about how you figure out where the efficiency curve is and then the economics by kind of segment. Don Civgin : Yes, Josh, it's -- clearly as Tom said, the Esurance acquisition was done to give us a strategic advantage with that particular customer segment, not to make our GAAP results easier to explain. And it has grown -- 14% growth this last quarter, on top of 27% last year, it's been growing really nicely. But it forces us to balance between the growth and the profitability. The way we run the company, the objective function is to grow it as quickly as we can while maintaining the economics so that the returns are above our cost of capital. Now that requires balancing a few things. So if I look at this year's result so far, we've been working hard on the loss ratio. That came down a couple of points again this quarter. It's down a little bit more than that year-to-date. We feel really good about the loss ratio. The expenses year-to-date are lower if you take out advertising. And then as Tom mentioned, we've got a couple of points of investment in things like motorcycle, homeowners, renters, other product launches and so forth. And what we're really trying to do then is balance how much we spend on marketing with the acquisition cost that creates so that we can continue to manage our combined ratio on a lifetime basis to be something under 100. Should we -- if we wanted to strategically, we could relax some of those constraints. But as Tom said, we don't want to use more than our share of the resources of the company. And they're growing really nicely. I mean, the fact that they're up 80%, 85% since we bought them and still running on a sustainable economic basis is good. So that's the construct under which we're operating. We'll continue to balance that kind of quarter-by-quarter as it relates to marketing. But my suspicion is we'll continue to see improvements in loss ratio because it's been a focus area, which will allow us to spend a little bit more on acquisition and still make the equation work. Patrick Macellaro : Jonathan, this is Pat, we'll take one more question. Operator : Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith from Evercore. Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Just one question. Management's stated goal has been to maintain the margin, and yet you've gone past it and done extremely well for the last couple of quarters. Curious as to whether you intend to keep this margin or do you think that your overrunning just a tad and would like to maybe just grow some more? Thomas J. Wilson: Well, as you point out, we're operating at the bottom end of the range that we provided to everybody in February. We provided that range to give you all a sense for how good we think the underlying economics are of the business, and we'll do that again in February, of the outcome here [ph]. We put a range on it obviously because frequency and severity can bounce around a good point each without actually -- the underlying -- the actual economics being just volatile as opposed to you've done something right or wrong. So we like where we're operating today. As you could hear from Don's comments, we're all in for growth, but it's got to be profitable growth. Sometimes we get growth and it's not profitable and then we shrink it. Other times, we get growth and it's profitable, a little more profitable than we think. So we toggle between those at a relatively micro level. But we don't have any desire to reduce our returns in auto or homeowners or our other businesses today to get more growth. We don't think we need to, we think we're accurately priced. We think the combination of our pricing sophistication, claim skills, distribution, unique value propositions, marketing, all that adds up to customer value where they're prepared to let us earn the economic rents we do. So we're happy with where we're at. So we're not looking to sort of say combined ratio's going to go up so we can grow another point. That's not a good trade for shareholders. Well, thank you all. I know you've got an incredible amount of work between -- in the next couple of days. So thank you for listening. Our strategy is working, it's profit growth, shareholder returns. We're proactive in running the business. We have a number of initiatives underway, which will enable us to continue to do those things. So we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Pat Macellaro. Please go ahead. Patrick Macellaro : Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Allstate's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. After prepared remarks by Tom Wilson, Steve Shebik and myself, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted the slides we'll use this morning. These are all available on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2013, our 10-Q for the third quarter, the slides and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release and in our investor supplement. We're recording the call, and a replay will be available following its conclusion. I'll be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. Now I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas J. Wilson: Well, good morning. Thank you for your continued interest and investment in Allstate. I'll provide an overview of where we stand strategically and operationally, and then Pat and Steve will go through the results in detail. And as always, our senior leadership team is here with us, so Matt Winter, who's Allstate's President and the leader of all the Allstate branded operations; Don Civgin, the President of Emerging Businesses; Kathy Mabe, who's President of our Business to Business Operations; Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; and then Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. Let's start with Page -- Slide 2, Allstate's 2014 results. It demonstrates that our consumer-focused strategy when combined with strong execution creates real value for shareholders. We had 5 operating priorities for 2014. Let me go through each of those with you, starting with growth. We had a good year with total policies in force growing by 840,000 or 2.5%. The Allstate brand had accelerating growth throughout the year as auto insurance built up momentum, and we've put increased focus on growing the homeowners business now that we're comfortable with its returns. The number of Allstate agencies increased by 4% for the year, and auto new business in 2014 hit a historical high. When combined with improving customer satisfaction and retention, that's leading to sustainable growth. We intentionally slowed growth at Esurance and Encompass to focus on improving returns. The second priority was to maintain margins, and we did this through the year with the underlying combined ratio being at the favorable end of the range we set at the beginning the year with you. Fourth quarter auto margins were off somewhat, and Pat will discuss that in a few minutes. The Allstate brand homeowners business had a great quarter with recorded combined ratio of below 70. Despite a 42% increase in catastrophe losses from the prior year, the combined ratio for this line and this brand was 82.5 for the full year, which results in a good long-term return on capital. Esurance's underlying combined ratio improved by 1 point for the year, and Encompass' average premiums were up, and frequency was down, but that's yet to translate into a lower combined ratio. You can also see the benefits this year of having a broad product portfolio on profitable growth, both on the upside in terms of growth and then balancing out our returns. The homeowners business now generates strong returns as do many of our other non-auto insurance products. Proactively managing our investment portfolio is also obviously required to generate good economic results for our shareholders. Our total return on the $81 billion portfolio was 5.80% for the year, which is a strong result given the large position in investment-grade corporate debt. We have maintained a shorter duration in the Property-Liability portfolio, which is focused on the 3- to 5-year portion of the curve because the return per unit of risk for going longer did not meet our objectives. We also made good progress of being more active in leveraging our position in buying and selling fixed income securities, so if you look at the 10-K, you'll see that our portfolio turnover is up a little bit there. In addition, allocations to investments with less correlation to public markets such as private equity, infrastructure, real estate, continue to be increasing. The last 2 priorities are longer term and include modernizing the operating model and building long-term growth platforms. The integration of data analytics and technology are enabling us to improve both the effectiveness and then the efficiency of -- throughout the company. Allstate Financial did a good job of reducing expenses given the reduced size of the business following the sale of Lincoln Benefit. We're now positioned to increase investments to further integrate this into the Allstate Agency channel with a customer focus. Esurance is a good growth platform for us, and we're increasing market share in that self-serve and branded customer segment through incremental marketing investments and by expanding into homeowners and other insurance lines and entering some new geographic markets. We're also investing heavily in telematics in growing our online aggregator Answer Financial. Go to Slide 3. The financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year are shown on this slide. Growth momentum continued. We increased net written premium by $1.4 billion this year or 5.1%, which reflects the policy in force growth and an increase in average premiums. Let me put this in perspective. That growth alone would be enough to rank us a top 25 personal lines carrier. Our financial results for the year were excellent. Net income was -- for the year was $2.7 billion. It was significantly higher than last year, but you remember last year, we recorded the initial estimated loss on the sale of Lincoln Benefit in 2013 results. Operating income was $5.40 a share, $5.40, which includes an increase of $742 million in pretax catastrophe losses compared with what was a relatively benign 2013. Capital management and shareholder returns are also priorities that did not change from year-to-year, and we had excellent results in those as well. Shareholders received $2.8 billion in cash, which represents almost 11% of our average market capitalization for the year. We also just raised the dividend by 7% and announced yesterday a new $3 billion share repurchase program. We further increased our financial strength by taking advantage of the opportunity to issue preferred stock at fixed rates and lower the debt-to-capital ratio to below 19%. Slide 4 then shows the full year operating results under the way in which we construct the market, so that's the 4 Property-Liability customer segments. This slide, we talked about every quarter for a while. If you start at the top of the slide, in aggregate, profitability was strong with a recorded combined ratio of 93.9, which included 6.9 points of catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio for the year that excludes catastrophes and reserve changes was 87.2, which was at the favorable end of the outlook of 87 to 89 provided for 2014. The Property-Liability results by customer segment are shown on the bottom half of this page. If you start in the lower left, the Allstate brand is our largest segment. It comprises over 90% of our property liability written premiums. Profitability in this segment was good across all products in 2014, and growth accelerated throughout the year. Auto policy growth of 2.9% versus the prior year was broad based and driven by strong new business results and stable retention. Homeowner policies grew 0.5 point so -- over the prior year, and other personal lines policies were 2.1% higher than the year-end 2013. Esurance in the lower right grew policies in force by 12.6% over the prior year. Our growth rate there was impacted by profit improvement actions and the growing size of the business. Advertising and expansion investments continue to have a negative impact on the recorded combined ratio, so therefore, we look at the underlying loss ratio, which, of course, excludes expenses, which removes the -- and then you look at catastrophes and prior reserve changes come out of that as well, and that was 76.6 of the full year, a full point better than 2013. While the returns on new business are above our cost of capital, we believe we can do better. So growth has been slowed, but we're still working on increasing market share. Encompass, in the upper left,, further slowed growth in 2014 as we expanded our profit improvement actions. This business is highly focused on lowering the underlying combined ratio in both auto and homeowners in 2015. Answer Financial, on the upper right, is an insurance aggregator and sells nonproprietary policies through the web and call centers to self-serve customers. Nonproprietary premiums of $527 million in 2014 increased over 10% versus the prior year. Go to Slide 5. I'd like to look forward before we dig deeper into the current results. On Slide 5, you can see there are 5 operating priorities for 2015, which are the same as they were for this year. The specifics under each of those, obviously, are evolving based on the progress we've made this year, but the overall categories are the same. We're also not changing our underlying combined ratio guidance from 87 to 89. That's the same in 2015 as it was in 2014. Now let me turn it over to Pat. Patrick Macellaro : Thanks, Tom. I'll begin by reviewing the Property-Liability highlights on Slide 6. Beginning with the chart on the top of this page, Property-Liability earned premium of $28.9 billion in 2014 grew $1.3 billion or 4.7% over 2013. Recorded combined ratio for the year of 93.9 increased 1.9 points versus 2013 driven by an increase in catastrophe losses of $742 million or 59.3% compared to the historically low level recorded in 2013. As Tom mentioned earlier, the year-to-date underlying combined ratio was an 87.2, at the lower end of our full year outlook range. Net investment income for the Property-Liability segment decreased 5.4% from the prior year due primarily to lower returns from the fixed income portfolio. Property-Liability operating income in 2014 was $2.1 billion, 16% lower than 2013, reflecting the higher catastrophe losses. Chart on the lower left shows net written premium and policy in force growth rates for Allstate Protection. The red line representing policy in force growth shows a continued positive trend that's being driven by all 3 underwriting brands. Policies in force grew by 840,000 or 2.5% from year-end 2013. The Allstate brand accounted for 78% of policy growth in 2014 compared with 27% in 2013. Average premium increases to reflect increased costs raised the total premium growth rate above unit growth. Exhibit to the right of this chart highlights the Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratio trends. You can see the consistency in our underlying results for the last 8 quarters as well as the quarterly seasonality we experienced in both the first and fourth quarters each year. You can also see from the red line that while the fourth quarter recorded combined ratio of 90 was the lowest in the year, it was due to the fact that lower catastrophe losses offset an increase in non-catastrophe losses driven by higher auto accident frequency. Page 7 highlights Allstate brand auto growth and margin trends. Focusing on growth in the chart on the top. Policies increased by 554,000 in 2014, which was 2.9% higher than 2013 driven by continued favorable new business and stable retention trends. Net written premium grew 4.5% in 2014 as average premiums increased to reflect loss cost increases. Chart on the lower left shows the consistent range of margin performance of Allstate brand auto. Maintaining auto profitability remains a critical priority for us and one of which we have established a long history of success through pricing discipline, underwriting and claims management. The underlying combined ratio was 94.2 in 2014, 0.2 point better than 2013. While the annual result was within our expected range of performance, we did experience a spike in the underlying combined ratio in the fourth quarter as you can see in the details on the right. Annualized average premium per policy, shown by the blue line, continued to increase over the prior year in the quarter. However, average underlying losses and expenses per policy, shown by the red line, increased 4% in the fourth quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. This increase was the result of higher levels of accident frequency experienced in the first 2 months of the quarter, which was driven by a combination of increased economic activity and non-catastrophe weather. Table below the graph shows the dollar margin per policy on this business by quarter to show the impact of seasonality. The blue boxes show the auto margin for the fourth quarter for the last 5 years. You can see that the $16 for 2014 is below 2012 and '13 but is in line with 2010 and '11. There's obviously a story for every statistic underneath these numbers, but this does show how seasonality can impact the results. In addition to adjusting prices for the frequency increases, we also closely watch severity levels. On a paid basis, bodily injury severity in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 6% higher than the prior year quarter. We did not experience a similar increase in our estimates of ultimate incurred severity for BI, but as always, we'll continue to monitor these trends and adjust pricing to hit our return targets. Moving on to Page 8. Allstate brand homeowners increased by 29,000 policies from the prior year quarter. Homeowner policy growth continues to be geographically focused in markets with adequate pricing and acceptable catastrophe exposure. Both increased new business sales and higher customer retention led to the growth. The chart on the bottom left shows the continued strength of homeowner profitability. We earned $1.1 billion in homeowner underwriting income in 2014 despite paying $1.4 billion in catastrophe losses. Combined ratio of 82.5 for the full year generated an acceptable long-term return on capital. Moving to the lower right. Annualized average premium, shown in blue, continued to increase, although the rate of increase was lower than recent history, reflecting improved returns. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy increased 3.3% to the prior year quarter. Frequency performed below prior year in 2014, and the 7.7% increase we expect -- we experienced in paid severity in the year was due in part to a shift in the distribution of types of claims. As the economy has improved, we received fewer theft claims, which tend to be less costly than the other homeowner perils we cover. Like auto, homeowner rate increases now are mostly intended to keep pace with trends and maintain margins. Page 9 provides an overview of growth and profit trends for Esurance and provides more detail behind Tom's opening comments. Starting on the left-hand side of the slide, Esurance's rate of policy and total net written premium growth continues to slow due to ongoing pricing and underwriting actions underway to ensure long-term profitable growth as well as the increasing size of the business. Total Esurance premiums grew by 15.5% in 2014, and policies in force grew 12.6% compared with 2013. Spending on expansion initiatives contributed approximately 2.7 points to the Esurance expense ratio in 2014, masking a 1 point improvement in the underlying loss ratio from year-end 2013. Page 10 provides an overview of growth and profit for Encompass. Encompass policy in force growth, illustrated by the red line in the chart on the left, continues to slow, reflecting actions taken to ensure acceptable long-term returns. Average premium increases driven by profit improvement actions helped to increase premium as shown by the blue line. As you can see on the right, Encompass' fourth quarter 2014 recorded combined ratio of 93.1 improved sequentially from the previous 2 quarters as homeowner results benefited from less severe weather patterns. Comparison to the prior year quarter was impacted by favorable loss development recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013. Encompass' trailing 12 months recorded combined ratio deteriorated to prior year, primarily driven by catastrophes, non-catastrophe-related weather and lower prior year reserve re-estimates. The underlying combined ratio of 93.7 remained flat to prior year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve to cover Allstate Financial investments and capital management. Steven E. Shebik: Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 11. As we discussed last quarter, our strategy is for Allstate Financial to become more integrated with the Allstate brand's customer value proposition. Expanding Allstate customer relationships to Allstate Financial's products and services will further our agents' positioning as trusted advisers. Allstate Financial results for the quarter and full year are highlighted on the top of this slide. Premiums and contract charges declined by 8.3% in 2014 due to the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. Excluding 2013 LBL results, Allstate Financial grew premiums and contract charges by 2.8% over the prior year. Operating costs declined by 17.5% or $99 million for the full year 2014, the result of actions to improve strategic focus and modernize the operating model. Operating income for the year was $607 million, 31.7% higher than 2013 when excluding the impact of the LBL disposition, due primarily to strong limited partnership income, lower expenses and profitable growth at Allstate Benefits. The chart on the bottom of this page shows the change in reserves and contractholder funds from year-end 2007 to year-end 2014. As you can see, Allstate Financial's product liabilities have been reduced by over 50% since 2007 due to actions taken to reduce exposure to spread-based annuity products along with the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. Select estimated historical results for Lincoln Benefit Life are provided on our investor supplement to provide you with further context. Shifting to investments on Slide 12. Our total portfolio return on the top was 1.1% for the fourth quarter, bringing total return for the full year 2014 to 5.8%. You can see that the valuation impact varies from quarter to quarter, primarily with changes in interest rates, while the income yield has been relatively constant. The lower half of the slide provides the investment income and yield for the Property-Liability in Allstate Financial portfolios. The Property-Liability interest-bearing yield in the lower-left graph reflects the impact of duration shortening in 2012 and 2013 and ongoing investment in the current low-interest-rate environment. The interest-bearing portfolios yield is close to current market yields and will respond more quickly to changes in interest rates as a result of this shorter maturity profile. Moving to the Allstate Financial portfolio in the lower right. The interest-bearing portfolio yield is higher and is more stable than the Property-Liability segment due to its longer duration and because portfolio cash flows had been used largely to fund reductions in our annuity obligations. In addition, total investment income reflects the impact of the LBL disposition in the second quarter of 2014 and the previously mentioned reduction in annuities. Both the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial portfolio total yields illustrate the variability in income that may result from limited partnership and other equity investments. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we expect these investments to increase returns in both portfolios, but results may vary from period to period. Slide 13 provides an overview of our capital position and shareholder returns as of year-end 2014. We continue to be in a strong capital position, a reflection of excellent earnings and a proactive approach to managing our balance sheet. Book value per common share reached $48.24, increasing 6.5% since year-end 2013. Operating income return on equity was 12.6% for the year, reflecting the impact of lower operating income and a higher equity base. Cash return to shareholders is shown in the upper-right graph. Shareholders received cash returns of $368 million in the fourth quarter as we repurchased 251 million of common shares to the settlement of our second accelerated share repurchase program in open market purchases and paid $117 million in common stock dividends. Total common shareholder cash returns for the year were $2.78 billion and included quarterly dividends to $750 million accelerated share repurchase programs and open market share repurchases. As of December 31, 2014, $336 million remained under the company's $2.5 billion share repurchase program authorized last February. We expect to finish this program in the first quarter of this year. Yesterday, the board continued its practice of returning excess capital to shareholders by increasing the dividend and approving a new share repurchase program. The common dividend was raised 7% to $0.30 per common share for the first quarter of 2015. In addition, a $3 billion share repurchase program was approved for execution through July 2016. With $3.4 billion of invested assets at the holding company and a debt-to-capital ratio below 19%, we have the financial capacity both to grow our businesses and execute these programs. Now let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Stirling from Bernstein. Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : So Tom, I wanted to ask a question, if I may, about Esurance and Encompass and thinking about margins for the overall company, driving some higher margins into these 2 smaller segments would seem to be some of your biggest levers for improving the combined -- overall combined ratios. And I'm wondering if you can sort of walk us through a bit more detail what your targets are for these businesses, some of the things you're doing to drive margins and if there's any specific challenges that we should understand because big picture, it feels like these are things that ought to offer you higher margins than you're able to deliver. Today, you've got a mass affluent business at Encompass, and obviously, Esurance has got attractive direct economics. But I'd really love to hear you walk through how you compare and contrast the long-term margin potential of both of these businesses and kind of what you're doing in both of them to get us there. Thomas J. Wilson: All right. Well, thank you, Josh. It's a good question. I'll provide some overview, and then I'll ask Kathy to talk a little bit about Encompass and Don to talk a little about Esurance. First, you're absolutely correct that those 2 businesses -- obviously, the math shows you that they don't generate the same amount of underwriting income as we get from the Allstate brand, and that is one of the reasons why we slowed the growth, is we want to diversify our profit sources amongst those. That said, we have different opportunities in the 2 areas, and we're investing differently in each of those. So -- but let me first talk about -- the Allstate brand is also a growth opportunity, as you can see from this quarter's results, and we can get back into that later if other people have questions. But I don't want people to feel like that's -- you saw we're adding agencies. The growth is picking up across product lines, so that's a good growth vehicle for us as well. The combination of all 3 of those brands gives us really a way to compete aggressively with people on a whole variety of fronts. And so managing those as a portfolio is important both from a go-to-market standpoint, a strategic standpoint and obviously, a financial standpoint. As it relates to Encompass, it is focused on the mass affluent. We need to raise returns in both of the auto and property businesses. The property business actually has a decent combined ratio relative to 100, but it doesn't have a good enough combined ratio relative to the returns we think it needs to have given the long-term volatility in that business. It bumps around a little more in terms of its profitability than you would see in the Allstate brand because it is geographically concentrated east of the Mississippi rather than across the country, so -- which sometimes confuses people as to why its results are down. But it had, obviously, high catastrophe losses this year, and they need to price for that. And Kathy can talk about specifically what they're doing to improve profitability. And as you would expect, a by state and by line kind of issue for us because we run this -- we try to manage this business as we do our other businesses at a local level. The Esurance story is slightly different. That is a good growth opportunity. We believe we can continue to pick up share in that business, and we're willing to invest profitability from around the company to do that. So if you look at our advertising expense, it's relatively high compared to competitors in the direct space. So you might see people spending about 10% in the direct space towards premiums on a sustainable basis. We're in the high teens, high end, so we're okay investing that additional money to drive growth as long as we believe that the returns on a long-term basis are attractive because then it's just a math problem in terms of how the accountants count up the profitability. We look at the cash returns on everything we do. So we think the returns -- we know the returns are above our cost of capital, but we think they can be better, particularly when we compare them to what we're doing by state in the Allstate brand. So Don and the Esurance team are working to both improve that underlying loss ratio and then manage the growth, but the combination of those 2 has brought its growth down, and we're starting to see the benefits to loss ratio, so -- but Don can give you some specifics. Kathy, why don't we start with Encompass? And then let's go to Esurance. Katherine A. Mabe: Okay. Thanks, Josh, for the question. In terms of Encompass, our goal this year is to return Encompass to a true underwriting profit, so we took a number of actions. We're always concerned about elasticity in this channel as we put rate and underwriting actions in. If you look at retention for both auto and home, it looks like we could have taken even stronger action, and we're prepared to do that in 2015 because our retention held as we put rate into auto and somewhat into home. The actions that we are taking are geared toward specific states that really have out-of-balance profitability challenges, and we have 5 key states that really need strong underwriting and pricing action, and that's already well underway. In addition, we're trying to reposition distribution to get to more profitable growth opportunities for Encompass. So those actions are also going on simultaneously. I think the biggest opportunity for us is to continue to have strong discipline on the underwriting side, particularly in those problem states. And so if -- I don't want to take too much time to go into detail, but it's a multiple grouping of levers that we're trying to pull simultaneously to improve the profit for Encompass. I think, also, it's safe to say that if you look at the amount of rate that we put into Encompass for the year, in auto, we took about 6.6%, and I think there's opportunity to take even more in 2015 because our retention was actually up 1 point in auto. Thomas J. Wilson: Don? Don Civgin : Josh, let me see if I can just add a little bit of color to what Tom talked about as it relates to Esurance targets. First, we've been consistent since we put the companies together, that our goal was to run the business in a way that it's economic over the lifetime of the policies that we're writing. And the good news is it's nearly twice as large as it was when we bought it. The bad news is, as a result, it had nearly twice the impact on the overall results, and so it's more noticeable. I would break the combined ratio into 2 pieces when you think about where we're headed with them, the loss ratio and then kind of expenses. The loss ratio showed a point or so improvement this year. That's good. We took a fair amount of rate. We took some underwriting actions because the loss ratio was too high last year. We're seeing it earn into the book. There's more to come. 76.6 is not good enough. We still have more work to do to get that number down. I'd like to think, over time, we'll get another point or 2 out of that. But the loss ratio is still a bit higher than it needs to be. On the expense side, it's a little bit of a different issue. We're trying to balance how much advertising we spend money on so that we can generate what ends up being economically viable long-term growth. And so it's a seasonal advertising spend. It's a bit of a seasonal business. We have quarters like the first quarter of last year where we spent an awful lot due to the Super Bowl and the launching of the campaign. But when you look throughout the year, Tom's right. 17.4 points is high, but it's still resulting in an economic lifetime return for the business. The other piece I wouldn't ignore because it's a big number is that there's a lot of expansion taking place. So Esurance is in far more states. It's got far more product with the bundled homeowners and motorcycles and renters policies, and that is taking its toll on the expenses as well to the tune of about 2.7 points this year. So when you put it together, I think there's some room for improvement that I -- let me say it more affirmatively. There's some expectation for improvement in the loss ratio. But on the advertising and the growth expenses, it's a balancing act, and what we don't want to do is choke the growth on the business just to satisfy a GAAP ratio. But we're conscious that it's impacting the company as Esurance continues to grow, so we just have to balance it. The bottom line is we're continuing to run the business on an economically correct basis. Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : That's really comprehensive. Just a -- sort of a short longer-term question. Tom, you mentioned big investments, 1 of your 5 priorities to modernize the operating model. I'm wondering if there's anything in particular that you'd like to talk about that we should be looking for that might drive margins over the next couple of years. Or on the growth side, I think you mentioned Answer Financial, you give it some visibility here, and then, obviously, you've been investing a lot in telematics and wondering if there's anything in particular we ought to be watching for, for you guys to do over the next year. Thomas J. Wilson: Josh, I think you should assume we will always invest in those things that are long term. We have both the earning power and the capital to invest in things like telematics to try to figure out how to grow in the aggregated channel, what we call, Integrated Digital Enterprise, which is about redoing our system with digitization and sort of straight-through processing. Not such though that those get -- we assume we have to cover that for our shareholders -- cover that with our shareholders, still deliver the profitability and invest for the future, but we don't really have projections as to what that will do for either top line or the bottom line in the short term. But know that we continue to invest for the long term because we recognize that if we don't do something today, we might me unhappy 3 or 4 years from now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I was wondering if you could drill down a little bit further into the auto loss ratio in the fourth quarter. You talked about, Pat -- I think, Pat, you mentioned severe weather, non-cat weather and frequency. Can we get a little bit more idea of how much of each of those contributed and what exactly was the frequency driver on the -- or the driver on the frequency side? Thomas J. Wilson: Mike, thank you for the question. Matt has been waiting anxiously for your question because he spent untold number of hours over the last, really, 3 months since we saw a tick-up in October. So we were on this early, and he can give you all the specifics. Matthew E. Winter: Thanks, Mike. Otherwise, I would feel like I had studied for the wrong question on a test. So let me give you some background. And first of all, both Tom and Pat touched on it in their opening remarks. First, at a high-level look at the seasonality that we always see with a combined ratio in the fourth quarter and when you look at Page 7 of the presentation, you'll see a fairly consistent spike in the fourth quarter. You see it clearly in 2010 and 2011. Recall that 2012 fourth quarter was Sandy, so some of the trends that normally appear were masked that quarter in cat. So there is some seasonality in the fourth quarter in the combined ratio. That's one. Second, as I believe Pat mentioned and I believe it was also highlighted in the release, when we talk about the uptick in frequency in the fourth quarter, we noted that there was an uptick in 2 out of the 3 months. It was an uptick in October and November that seemed to moderate, and we had the December that was more in line with prior trends. So we had a 2- out of 3-month tick-up. Third point is what's driving it and what's not driving it. Let me start with what's not driving it. Number one, we saw nothing to indicate that it's a quality-of-business issue or that it's being driven by growth, which is a natural question that you would have since I hope some time during the call we talk about the growth we're achieving in the auto business. And so with all that growth, you question is this somehow related. Well, we looked at new to renewal ratios. We looked at state mix ratio. We looked at rating plan relativities, and we saw nothing in there that would indicate that it was a quality-of-business or growth-related issue. So what is it likely related to? Well, we went back and looked historically over the last 7 to 8 years, and a couple of things emerged. First, 2 factors traditionally drive PD frequency, miles driven and precipitation, especially precipitation during peak driving times. Between those 2, miles driven has about roughly 3x the impact of precipitation. Within miles driven, the vast majority is driven by unemployment rate and a much smaller impact actually from gas prices. So I know that people tend to think that it's driven by gas prices, but really, it's driven by economic activity and the improvement in unemployment rates. In fact, 11 of the last 12 years with lower unemployment rates saw higher miles driven, and so we see a very, very close correlation there. On the BI side, it was elevated. Frequency was elevated, but I would remind you that we had abnormally favorable results in the fourth quarter of '13 because there were more low-impact collisions last year due to winter weather. So we had this dynamic last year, PD was up 1.4 and BI frequency was down 1.7. When you look at it over a 2-year basis and you take out some of that noise from prior year, PD and BI are much more consistent. PD is up 1.9 and BI, up 2.2. So we take all of that and we say, \"So what do we do with all of that?\" Well, what we do is what we do best as a company, which is continue to manage margins effectively using our combination of a centralized system and a decentralized rate management system. So we are taking our local market operating committee work, looking at what's emerging on a state-by-state and geography-by-geography level, and we take rate as needed. I know some of you believe that we've moderated our rate actions. I would just say that we stabilized our rate actions as we've gotten to the point where rates are more appropriate and we are in a better position to take smaller, more stable, more consistent rate as needed to follow trends, and that's exactly what we're doing. We're under no constraints. We can take rate if indicated and if we need to. And we will take rate if we need to and if the trends indicated. But we've been fortunate that we've been able to take moderately consistent rates, which has enabled us, I think, to compete more effectively with our peers. So I think the system is highly efficient at maintaining margins. I think we are reacting quickly. I think we are, I use a phrase, appropriately paranoid. I think we get paid to worry a lot and to focus intensely a lot, but in no way are we panicked or in no way are we concerned that it's a quality issue, and we'll continue to manage it the way we do and have done for many, many years. Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I mean, I guess, so the bottom line then is, I mean, from your perspective, it sounds like you understand what happened, and you're taking action to address it. So there's not a third factor of why is this happening and what can we do about it that you're concerned about. Matthew E. Winter: We're confident that we have analyzed this to death, some might say. We understand the drivers. We understand the dynamics in the marketplace, and we know how to use the levers available to us to react to it to maintain margins. Thomas J. Wilson: Which is why we committed to 87 to 89 for next year. Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And then just one real quick one on capital. Just looking at $3.4 billion in holdco capital, this year, it's up 20-ish percent from last year, which is up considerably from the year before. Without Lincoln Benefit there and kind of a more streamlined infrastructure, how should we think about what that -- what you want that number to be on a go forward? And also, just trying to reconcile, too, just a bit of a lighter buyback in the fourth quarter. What was the thought process there just given that big capital chunk at the holdco? Thomas J. Wilson: Yes. Mike, let me give you a -- start with the second one first, and then Steve can give you some specifics on ASRs and the impacts. So first, as it relates to the share buyback, the $2.5 billion that we're -- we'll be competing this first quarter, you'll remember when we set that out, there was $2.5 billion over 18 months, and we'll clearly be done with it a lot sooner than that. So we've been buying shares back aggressively and ahead of schedule because we have the capital both in the company and at the holding company level. Steve can talk about the impact. I know you had a question on the fourth quarter rate, so he can help you sort through that piece. And as it relates to holding company cap, we think about capital for the whole company, and we try to have -- to the extent the capital and the cash is at the holding company, we have more flexibility with that. So we have a process of having -- moving it up as often and frequently as we can. If it needs to go down to a subsidiary, like it has in the past, then we do that. If the subsidiaries are appropriately capitalized, then we like to keep somewhere around $1 billion up there, which covers a year's worth of dividends and interest payments so that if anything were to happen in the subsidiaries. But we could obviously, given our debt capacity, run much lower than that, and so if we had a use for that capital, one way or the other, we could run with very little cash at the holding company. You want to talk about... Steven E. Shebik: Yes. So we execute our share buybacks a number of ways, one, open market purchases obviously. A second that we've used the last couple of years are accelerated share repurchase programs, and when you see the bumps between quarters, it's generally because of the accelerated share repurchase buybacks. Those are front-end loaded essentially. So the particular one in the last half of the year, we entered into, after our second quarter earnings, $750 million program, provided 4.5 months of buyback for the investment bank that executed that for us. So over that period of time, in the third quarter, you saw roughly $1 billion of buybacks. In the fourth quarter, you saw $250 million. And that's because we gave the $750 million to the investment bank back at the beginning of the program. They bought back. They effectively gave us a significant portion of the stock they will buy back under that program over the next 4.5 months. We recorded that in the third quarter. And in the fourth quarter, we just have a settle up, which happened in mid-December, which is about $100 million -- a little bit about $100 million and 1.6 million shares, something like that. That's why you saw such a low number in the fourth quarter. Same phenomenon happened in the earlier in the year, if you remember, in the first quarter to second quarter. Thomas J. Wilson: Mike, let me maybe provide some economic perspective. Why would you use an accelerated share repurchase, right? So what happens is Steve writes a check to the investment bank. They give us a whole bunch of shares. Those go off of the share count, which, obviously, has an impact on your recorded shares, which helps with operating earnings per share. But that's not why we do it. We do it because it's economic. We don't do anything for bookkeeping around here. We -- other than keep the books well, as opposed to -- they\u2019re looking at me like he's about to shoot me. But we do it because we essentially sell off the volatility. By entering into an ASR, we can sell off of the volatility, and we end up with a lower net economic cost of purchasing the shares. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith from Evercore. Vinay Misquith - Evercore ISI, Research Division : So the first thing is, Matt, I think you studied for the correct test. So the question is on the frequency on the personal auto, curious as to whether you think this is an industry issue or something that just Allstate is seeing. And as a follow-up to that, how much of rate do you think you need to take to offset this higher frequency? Matthew E. Winter: Thanks, Vinay. First of all, it's really impossible to compare Allstate's results to competitor results. There's different books, different geographic locations, different starting points in history. And remember, a lot of what we're talking about is versus the prior year, so we all started in different places. So I can't talk about what other competitors might be experiencing and might not be and by what measures they are. I can say that precipitation and unemployment rates are not Allstate peculiar issues. They're environmental issues. So they may impact competitors differently based upon our geographic footprint, based upon where the precipitation occurred and based upon the books of business. But they're not going to be related specifically to the company. They're related to the general environment. So I would expect that we would see some indications and we have. I think most people have been attributing it to gas prices, to the miles driven, which I think is, as I said earlier, just a moderately important piece of this, while I think the unemployment rate is more significant. On the rate question, we'll take as much rate as we need to maintain margins as is indicated in each geography as appropriate. I don't tell you in advance because I don't know what will emerge. But you look at our history, you look at our quarterly history over the last many, many years, and we'll take rate as needed, and we maintain margins. We're quick to react. We're fortunate in that our structure allows us to take rate quickly, and it earns in quickly. And as a result, we don't have long-term dislocations between indications and reactions. Thomas J. Wilson: Vinay, this is Tom. To long-term trends, I'd point out what Matt -- and reiterate what Matt just said. If you look at our long-term profitability in auto insurance versus the industry, we're obviously in the upper quartile of that. There's about 3 companies that consistently make money. If you look at the homeowners business, the same thing is true, it's a different group of companies, and we were not in that category 10 years ago. We are in that category now with about 3 companies that make most of the money. And then if you look at fast-track results, which is an industry thing, over a long period of time, we show improvements versus the industry, so that supports that number. And if you look at pricing versus our competitors, Matt is exactly right. Our numbers always look like low single digits in total, obviously, bounces around a lot by state. Matt's had to take a lot of rate in. Your question really, if you ask Matt about Michigan, he'll give you a different answer than if you ask him about Wisconsin. The -- so -- but ours tend to be frequent and small. Some of our other competitors, particularly in the auto space, bump around a little more than we do. Vinay Misquith - Evercore ISI, Research Division : Sure, that\u2019s helpful. The second question is -- I was wondering if you could comment on Google's proposed entry into selling insurance online. Would Allstate be willing to join that marketplace? Thomas J. Wilson: Vinay, I would say we're in that marketplace with the largest aggregator that there is today. So Answer Financial is the largest, at least, as far as we know. It's not really industry specific on that upper-right quadrant. It's not like there's a specific industry study on that. But Answer Financial does over $0.5 billion in premium for other companies. A lot of it is done online through the web or through the call centers. So it is -- it serves that self-serve aggregator customer, which would be the people purportedly that Google would be attempting to -- they've been talking about doing that for some time. We're in the marketplace. It's not as big a market as you would see in the U.K. and other places for a whole bunch of dynamics, which is a longer conversation. But I would say we're there and active. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division : For the Allstate brand, we've seen favorable acceleration of policy in force growth every quarter for the past several, so I just wanted to confirm whether that trend will continue. Thomas J. Wilson: Let me have Matt deal with that because he's very happy that you asked the question and very happy with himself as am I. Matthew E. Winter: Yes. So thank you for noticing. Look, it's widespread and it's -- so we had -- we have 44 states that are growing year-over-year in IF growth and standard auto. And what's interesting about it to us is it's driven almost equally now by new business and retention trends, so it's about 50-50. As you noted, it's our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, and it's actually our 7th consecutive quarter-over-quarter increase. So the trend line and the momentum is building. I obviously can't tell you exactly how long that will continue. That will depend upon a wide variety of factors. I can tell you that the momentum engine is building. We are -- we added a great number of agencies. And despite the fact that we have probably 30% fewer agencies than we did 4 or 5 years ago, we're at historical high levels of new business production. That's because their productivity is at an all-time high. Quote volumes are at an all-time high, and close rates are dramatically better than they were. So we see that momentum continuing to build as we have points of presence continuing to build, and we have an aggressive growth and recruiting plan, aggressive plans to add additional license sales professionals. And we believe that the combination of that existing growth momentum with all the work we have underway, with trusted advisor, with deepening the relationships, with bringing in the other -- the remainder of the product sets, with bringing in life and retirement products, consumer household products and truly managing all the risks for our customers and their households, we believe that all of those factors will act synergistically to perpetuate that growth trend line. So we're -- I'm bullishly optimistic on it, but I cannot give you a time frame for how long it will continue at that quarter-over-quarter increase. Thomas J. Wilson: Jay, I would also encourage everybody to think about growth on a broad basis. So we tend to get into conversations about growth in auto because, obviously, it's our biggest line of business, and the public comparisons are easiest to make between us and other people because that's there. But if you look at -- Matt, is -- the work that's in auto, it's obviously, great. So we're growing, as Matt said, in a whole bunch of states. Homeowners business is also growing as well, and I think in 27 states, Matt, you're up in like 6 of the top 11 or something like that. So he's -- they're -- you're starting to see that grow, too. So as you think about growth, think about it from a customer standpoint, which is selling auto, homeowners, other property lines, which were up 2.1% last year. So this is about building the relationship which also leads to sustainability. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Matt, on the frequency issue, you said that the frequency recovered in December. Was that also the case in January? Thomas J. Wilson: We just closed the month end. Let's just say that, obviously, we were looking at it on the first... Matthew E. Winter: An hourly basis. Thomas J. Wilson: We get claim counts daily, so let's just say we looked at it. We don't give out results, but it didn't -- we did know what the numbers were before we committed to 87-89. Steven E. Shebik: Let you know in May. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, so it doesn't seem -- I mean, it seems like it was more of a 2-month split in 4Q rather than an ongoing basis. Thomas J. Wilson: I think I would focus on the point Matt made, which is think of the system. We have a system of adapting, adjusting. It's local. It's centralized. And whatever happens, whether it's frequency, severity, mix of business, we're about doing a good job for our customers and making sure our shareholders are well compensated for that. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division : That makes sense. And the last one is on the capital management plan. So over the past 2 years, it looks like the share count has been reduced as a result of buybacks by 6% to 7%. It seems like that might even accelerate in 2015. I'm just trying to get a sense of if you think about reducing the share count as a capital management goal consistent with the dollar amount of capital returned. Thomas J. Wilson: No, we look at it on a dollar basis. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Sarah E. DeWitt - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Could you talk about your appetite to do a significant reinsurance deal on the homeowners business? And would you consider reinsuring a significant portion of the business or maybe even the whole thing given that reinsurance market conditions are increasingly favorable? And if so, do you think you can find a counterparty for that? Thomas J. Wilson: It's a good question. As you know, the -- we have number of sources of capital, our own money, which we get from shareholders. We have capital we can get from reinsurers and increasingly a developing alternative source of capital called cat bonds or sidecars or a variety of other things. And that market is growing quite rapidly. There are a number of people who want to get into that market because the returns are uncorrelated with overall market returns. And so we see that growing. That capital has been coming in at a lower cost of capital than provided to us by external sources. So we've been actively using that. Steve, you did a -- what was the size of the cat bond this year? Steven E. Shebik: 2014 was just under $1 billion in total. Thomas J. Wilson: So we did a cat bond this year because we thought it was cheaper than traditional reinsurance. We have looked at replacing some of our own capital with third-party capital. We look at that all the time. It just -- it's whether you use preferred stock or common stock or third-party alternative capital. We have a number of requirements that we have on that, which have not yet been resolved in terms of how to do it. But I can tell you that we continue to look at it quite aggressively. Those requirements are -- we need some stability in our pricing on behalf of our customers. We don't want to be out in the market every year trying to find $2 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion worth of capital and what are we going to charge our customers for it and have to run that through prices. Secondly, it has to meet our economic standards that it's a good trade for us. And then thirdly, there's a whole bunch of, what I would just say, legal accounting hurdles one has to get through so that it's displayed in the reported financials the way the economics are set up. Sometimes things show up as derivatives and stuff like that, and it just makes everybody's life more confusing because the financial structure doesn't show you the economics of that, which we got. So we're hard at work at it. I don't -- I think this is one of those things that develops over time. I think it is -- there's optionality in terms of our ability to further improve our return on capital, and -- but the -- I think the biggest driver will be if we can take some volatility out of the P&L, that should reduce our cost of capital. So if you look at the cost of capital for the auto insurance business, it would be lower than the cost of capital for the homeowners business. To extent Steve can find a way to access alternative capital, reduce volatility, maybe even reduce some of the capital we have in the business, that should not only free up capital, Sarah. It should also improve our PE. So we're hard at work on it. I don't think you expect to see anything in the short term because it is a complicated problem. But if there's -- we are spending a lot of time on it. Sarah E. DeWitt - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And if you could find the capital, how much of the homeowners business would you want to reinsure versus retain? Thomas J. Wilson: All depends on the price. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Capital. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Pension, $700 million swing on penalty to AOCI, so book value didn't grow. Maybe you could walk through -- I assume it's interest rates that drove that addition. And what -- did you use a year-end sort of interest rate compass? Or were you able to take advantage of the increased knowledge of yields coming down higher in 2015? I guess the question is do we look at another hit like this coming next year if rates stay where they are. Steven E. Shebik: So I'll keep -- this is Steve. I'll keep this simple for you. The -- at the end of the year, we mark our pension liabilities to the current interest rate discount -- what we call the discount rate liabilities at 12/31. So the discount rate this year-end 12/31/2014 was almost the same as it was 2 years ago. So what happened is we got a benefit in 2013, and we gave it back at the end of 2014. Secondly, we alone with every other public company, I believe, are adopting new mortality assumptions that the Society of Actuaries issued in October. So that, for financial reporting purposes, increased our liability also. You will -- we will -- we have not and we will not put that in their actual employee calculations until the IRS adopts that same program probably in a couple of years. Those are the 2 principal changes you saw. The Society of Actuaries change -- I don't remember when was it was last changed, the mortality assumptions, but it was well more than a decade ago. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : 6% or 7%. Yes, it's a decade ago. Steven E. Shebik: More than a decade ago. So that happens every decade or so. The discount rate changes every year. So if rates go down at the end of next year, you'll have another increase. If rates go up, you'll get a benefit like we did in 2013. Thomas J. Wilson: Bob, if you'll remember... Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : And -- go ahead, I'm sorry. Thomas J. Wilson: You remember last year, we changed our pension benefits and put them all, everybody into the same plan, which had a substantial benefit to the balance sheet and ongoing operating. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Any implications to funding for 2015 cash flow? Steven E. Shebik: Nothing other than normal funding considerations we would consider the normal cost of the plan. And over time with this mortality assumption change, we'll probably have to fund more in the plan potentially given the investment returns we get in the assets. Thomas J. Wilson: So let me close with 4 thoughts : So our strategy focusing on the unique value propositions is working. The Allstate Agency business has excellent prospects for profitable growth. Our business model being in all 4 segments is working as is the ability to have a broad product portfolio. We're seeing some of our competitors take similar -- try to do what we have built. Secondly, we are delivering sustainable growth and profitability. That's our operating expertise. The process is our culture of adapting. Third, we give outstanding cash returns to shareholders. And lastly, we are financially in an extremely strong position, which gives us the resources. We obviously have the will and the ability to continue to compete effectively. So thank you much. I will talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Pat Macellaro, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patrick Macellaro : Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Allstate's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. After prepared remarks by Tom Wilson, Steve Shebik and myself, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the first quarter and posted the slides we'll use this morning. we also posted a document describing our 2015 country-wide, excluding Florida, reinsurance program. These are all available on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2014, the slides, and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release and in our investor supplement. We are recording the call, and a replay will be available following its conclusion. And I'll be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. Now I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas J. Wilson: Good morning, thank you for investing your time with us. I'll begin with an overview of our results on Slide 2. Then Pat and Steve will go through the results in detail. Also here to engage with you are Matt Winter, Allstate's President, also the leader of our Allstate branded operations; Don Civgin, the President of Emerging Businesses; Kathy Mabe, who leads Business to Business in Encompass; Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. So let me begin, with the strength of our strategy is really evident in this quarter's results. We have a broad-based business model that serves a wide range of customers with a broad range of products. What that does is it enables us to generate profitable growth, despite a changing economic and competitive environment. Our results reflect progress on all 5 operating priorities for 2015, which are to grow, while maintaining the underlying combined ratio, practically manage the $80 billion investment portfolio and invest for sustainable value creation. Our position in multiple customer segments, insurance products, geographies and investments enables us to continue meeting our short and long-term commitment to shareholders, our customers, our agency owners and employees as well as local communities. If you turn to Slide 3, you can see the financial outcomes of our performance in the first quarter of 2015. We continue to build growth momentum by adding 875,000 policies over the last 12 months, and now reaching $34.4 million. When combined with price increases, this resulted in net written premium growth of 4.8%, the benefit of a segmented approach to the market was evident as growth continued to accelerate in the Allstate brand, which gave us room to slow growth in the Esurance and Encompass businesses, given our economic targets for those 2 businesses. The recorded combined ratio was 93.7, which was better than last year. This decline reflected lower catastrophes, which also shows the benefit of having a diversified product portfolio, as an uptick in the Allstate brand auto combined ratio to 96.8 in the first quarter, was offset by an Allstate brand homeowners combined ratio of 78.7. Esurance and Encompass; they're still making progress on improving value creation and the results still need to improve. When you take out the volatility associated with catastrophes and reserve changes, you can see that the underlying combined ratio deteriorated slightly, but within the full year range of 87 to 89. This level of profitability does include expenses, which build long-term value, such as growing Esurance and investing in long-term growth platforms, and I'll talk about that in just a minute. Investment results were good when adjusted for the reduction of asset due to the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life in the second quarter of last year. Our proactive approach to investing to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns, not just operating income continue to benefit our overall results and we had strong results from limited partnerships, which offset the impact of reducing interest rate risk in the fixed income portfolio. We also had really good results from a more focused but smaller Allstate Financial. Total net income was $648 million in the quarter, $1.53 a share as you can see in the box at the top of that slide. Operating income was $1.46 per share, which was 12.3% higher than the same quarter last year, which reflected both higher income and fewer shares outstanding. The first quarter Property-Liability results for each customer segment are shown on Slide 4. I'm just going to comment on the circled numbers in each segment, starting with the Allstate brands in the lower left, which serves, of course, customers that prefer local advice in a branded offering. Policy In Force growth accelerated across all products as Matt's team pursues a comprehensive and fully integrated growth plan. The underlying combined ratio for this business, which represents 90% of our total premiums written was 87.4 in the quarter. Esurance in the lower right focuses on customers who prefer a self-serve approach, but want a branded offering. Policy growth slowed to 8.9%. The underlying combined ratio of $116.5 million included advertising expenses, which are being made to grow share and the costs associated with expanding the product offering and the geographic reach. As a result, we look at the underlying loss ratio, which was 78.2 in the first quarter, which still needs to be lowered. Moving to the customer segment that prefers local advice but is brand neutral, which is in the upper left, that's the segment that we serve with our Encompass business. This business got marginally smaller in first quarter as we seek to improve profitability. So as a management team, we're committed to both delivering these current results as well as investing in sustainable value creation as shown on Slide 5. While these items on this page all had a negative impact on current quarterly earnings, they are an important driver to shareholder value. So therefore, we're completely committed to them. We made good progress in modernizing our operating model. We also continued laying the foundation to reducing low value added activities handled by Allstate Agencies, while increasing their ability to provide trusted advice to customers. Since acquiring Esurance in 2011, we've grown market share by repositioning the brand, expanding its geographic footprint and its product offerings, and supporting this with advertising investments that are higher than justified by current premium levels. We continue to invest in share growth as long as lifetime returns on new customers exceed our cost to capital. We are also seizing the opportunity that comes with connecting customers to telephony by expanding our telematics offering. We now have over 0.75 million customers using Drivewise and DriveSense. We are also innovating our roadside service operating model, which has over 3 million members in the -- under the Allstate brand and many millions more under our weight [ph] label offerings. So in summary, our goal is to both deliver today and build for tomorrow. And now let me turn it over to Pat to go through the Property-Liability results in more detail. Patrick Macellaro : Thanks, Tom. I'll begin by reviewing our Property-Liability results on Slide 6. Starting with the chart on the top of this page, Property-Liability had earned premium of $7.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015, 5.1% higher than the first quarter of 2014. Recorded combined ratio of 93.7 was a 1.0 lower than the prior year quarter driven by catastrophe losses of $294 million, which were 33.9% lower than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 89 was 6/10 of a point higher than the first quarter of 2014. Net investment income for the Property-Liability segment increased 14.7% from the first quarter of 2014, due primarily to strong limited partnership returns in the quarter. As a result, Property-Liability operating income in the first quarter was $555 million, 18.6% higher than the first quarter of 2014. The Chart on the lower left shows Net Written Premiums and Policy In Force growth rates for Allstate Protection. The red line representing Policy In Force growth shows the continued positive policy growth trend that is being driven by the Allstate brand. Policies In Force grew by 875,000 or 2.6% from the first quarter of 2014. The Allstate brand accounted for 86% of policy growth in the first quarter of 2015, based on the strength of Auto, Homeowners and Other personal lines. Total premium grew 4.8% in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year, reflecting the combination of policy and average premium increases. Exhibits to the right of this chart displays the Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratio trends. You can see the recorded first quarter combined ratio was lower than the historical first quarter average and below the first quarter of 2014, due to lower catastrophe losses. Total underlying combined ratio of 89 was more in line with the historical trend and was impacted by higher auto losses in the first quarter of 2015 versus the prior year quarter. Page 7 highlights Allstate brand Auto growth and margin trends. Growth trends are highlighted in the top or in the chart on the top. Policies increased by 623,000 in the first quarter of 2015 or 3.2% higher than the first quarter of 2014, driven by continued broad-based increase in new business and stable retention trends. Auto items In Force grew in 42 states in the first quarter of 2015. Net written premium grew 5.7% as average premiums increased by 2.3% over the prior year quarter. The chart on the lower left shows the past 3 years' quarterly recorded and underlying margin performance for Allstate brand auto. The recorded combined ratio was 96.8 in the first quarter of 2015, 3.4 points worse than the first quarter of 2014, and the underlying combined ratio was 95.6 in the first quarter, 1.8 points higher than the prior year quarter. Further details are shown in the chart on the bottom right. Annualized the average earned premium per policy, shown by the blue line, continue to increase over the prior year in the first quarter. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy, shown by the red line, increased 4.1% in the first quarter compared with the first quarter of 2014 and was impacted by 3 separate drivers. First, Allstate brand prior year auto reserve re-estimates were unfavorable. About half of the impact is due to litigation settlement accruals on older cases, while the rest is driven by variations in reserving. Second, bodily injury frequency increased 6.8% compared with the first quarter of last year. The increase is explained partially by comparisons to a very favorable quarter of BI frequency in the first quarter of 2014. But it also reflects higher frequency experience across our book of business. Third, property damage frequency increased 2.1% in the first quarter compared with the prior year quarter. This increase is due in part to adverse winter weather in the eastern part of the country. But again, we're also seeing higher PD frequency this year than we did for most of last year. You may recall that we did experience elevated property damage frequency in last year's first quarter due to widespread winter weather, when we look at bulk coverages over a multiyear period the trends across as BI and PD are very consistent. As you'd expect, we've continued to dig into the drivers of increased frequency since the trends began to emerge in the fourth quarter of last year. Leverage our data and analytic capabilities to continuously analyze our business from the macro level down to the micro segments that our local teams used to underwrite in price. Some examples of items we've been investigated include the impact of new to renewal loss ratio relativities, often referred to as the new business penalty form writing higher volumes in new business, state mix and geographic mix within states, higher growth books of business versus stable or moderately growing books, monoline versus multiline, liability only versus full coverage, and quality characteristics such as insurance score, driver age and household composition. Based on our analysis, we continue to be comfortable with the quality of both our new and renewal business. This analysis also reinforces our conclusion that recent frequency fluctuations are due primarily to macroeconomic trends in weather. And that while we believe industry-wide auto frequency will continue its long-term downward slope overtime, there will be periods of variability within that trend that are driven by external factors. Our regional teams have been quick to identify these developing trends on a local market basis and have taken and will continue to take appropriate underwriting and pricing actions to achieve our targeted returns. Given current trends, we expect the level of underwriting changes and rate increases to accelerate. Improved rate increases in April of 2015 exceed that of the entire first quarter of 2015. The result of our regional teams adjusting the timing and the amount of rates that were already planned in the year. We do not believe these actions to maintain margins will materially impair current policy growth trends. Moving to page 8. Let's discuss Allstate brand homeowners. Growing homeowners in parts of the country that are adequately priced and have acceptable exposure to catastrophes. Policy growth is being driven by both increased new business and improved retention. The chart on the bottom left shows the continued strength of homeowner profitability and the earnings benefit we experienced in the first quarter of 2015 from having a diversified product portfolio. Recorded combined ratio was 78.7 for the first quarter of 2015 and the underlying combined ratio of 64.5 improved by 1.3 points from the first quarter of 2014 Moving to the lower left, annualized average premiums shown in blue continues to improve the slowing rate versus the recent history, reflecting improved returns. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy were essentially flat to the prior year quarter. Non-catastrophe frequency in the first quarter of 2015 was 7.9 points below the prior year quarter, and the 6.6% increase experienced in paid severity was due to the claim count mix. Individual homeowners severity parallels are performing within expected ranges. Page 9 provides an overview of growth and profit results for Esurance and Encompass. Starting on the upper left of the slide, Esurance's rated policy and total network and premium growth continues to slow due to ongoing pricing and underwriting actions underway to ensure long-term profitable growth as well as the increasing size of the business. Total Esurance premiums grew by 8.9% in the first quarter, policies in force grew 8.6% compared with the first quarter of 2014. Esurance profitability shown in the upper right chart was impacted by higher claim frequency and higher severity on collision and property damage. Esurance's expense ratio decreased 10.7 points in the first quarter of 2015 compared with the prior year quarter, given last year's first quarter spend to reposition the brand. Spending on expansion initiatives, contributed approximately 2.8 points to the Esurance's expense ratio in the first quarter compared with 2 points in the first quarter of 2014. Encompass policy in force growth, illustrated by the gray line in the chart on the bottom left, fell to negative 2/10 due to lower new business and lower retentions, the result of ongoing profit improvement actions. Decline in policies also impacted net written premiums which is 1.4% lower in the first quarter of 2015 compared with the first quarter of 2014. Encompass' first quarter recorded combined ratio of 95.6 improved by 7 points, primarily driven by lower catastrophe losses. And now I'll turn it over to Steve to cover Allstate Financial investments and capital management. Steven E. Shebik: Thanks, Pat. Slide 10 provides an overview of Allstate Financial. As we've discussed previously, we strategically repositioned Allstate Financial over the last several years to focus its business on Allstate brand customers. The most recent action was to sell Lincoln Benefit Life and further integrate the life business into the Allstate brand value proposition. Allstate Financial results for the first quarter are highlighted in the bottom of the slide. Premiums and contract charges increased 2.9% when compared to first quarter of 2014 results, excluding LBL. Growth was driven primarily by increased additional life insurance renewal premiums, Allstate benefit accident and health insurance business. Allstate Benefits now has 3.2 million policies in force, making it a major player in the voluntary workplace benefits business. Operating income for the first quarter was $134 million, 13.5% lower than the first quarter of 2014 after adjusting for the disposition of Lincoln Benefit Life. This reduction in operating income was driven primarily by lower investment income related to prepayment fees and litigation settlements, and higher life mortality and expenses than the prior year first quarter. Moving to investments in the chart at the top of the Slide 11. Our portfolio total return was 1.7% for the first quarter. The components of the total return continue to show that the income yield remains consistent while the valuation impact varies from quarter-to-quarter. Most recently, being driven by reductions in interest rates since year end 2014. Our portfolio valuations have not been materially impacted by lower energy prices as the majority of our assets with exposure to the energy sector are investment-grade corporate bonds, which are currently in an unrealized gain position. The lower half of the slide provides the investment income in yield for the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial portfolios. The Property-Liability interest-bearing yield in the lower left graph reflects the impact of prior duration shortening and ongoing investments in a low interest-rate environment. The interest-bearing portfolios yield is close to current market yields and is expected to respond more quickly to changes in interest rates as a result of its shorter maturity profile. Moving to the Allstate Financial portfolio in the lower right. The interest-bearing portfolio yield is higher and more stable than the Property-Liability segment due to its longer duration and its cash flows being used largely to fund annuity reductions. The drop in investment income primarily reflects the LBL disposition and the aforementioned reduction in annuities. Total first quarter limited partnership income was 39% higher than the same period last year, helped by a strong quarter for our real estate investments. Economic conditions and high liquidity levels have contributed to favorable market performance, which is reflected in strong limited partnership results in both portfolios. As you can see from the charts, limited partnerships and other equity investments bring a higher degree of variability to our income, while more volatile, we expect these investments to increase returns in both portfolios over the long-term. Slide 12 provides an overview of our strong capital position and excellent shareholder returns at the end of the first quarter. During the quarter, we returned $1 billion in cash to common shareholders through a combination of common dividends and share repurchases. We completed our 2014, 2.5 billion common share repurchase authorization in February by initiating new $3 billion authorization. A $500 million accelerate repurchase program was executed in March, which should be completed by mid-June. As of March 31, we had $2.4 billion remaining on our current repurchase authorization, which is expected to be completed by July 2016. We provide additional information on our share repurchase activities this quarter in the chart on the right. In the table under the chart, you can see the impact of accelerated share repurchase initiations and settlements for each of the past 9 quarters. We have also posted an explanatory document on ASRs our Investor Relations website this morning. Yesterday afternoon, we communicate the details of our 2015 catastrophe reinsurance program, excluding Florida. We rolled our expiring nationwide contract in a similar to lower-cost agreements and added approximately $300 million of coverage for growth in our business. As in prior years, I challenged our team to push the envelope a bit. You will see this year's program race through the historic 3-year duration of traditional reinsurance with 2 7-year 2 limit multi-pillar reinsurance covers to provide further stability in our business for our customers. We expect to place our Florida program in the second quarter. And we'll communicate details at that time. Now let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : So I wanted to start off with a question about growth. You guys have nicely increased your production coming from the core agency channel over the past few years. And there's a bunch of different things that have been going on, you talked about new younger agents coming into sort of freshen the footprint, also invest in developing agency management strategies and in cross-selling. And now you're talking a bit about the sort of evolving the -- how you run agencies, to focus more on higher value-added advisory relationships. And I was kind of trying to figure out -- map, I was trying to go through an exercise in my mind of mapping the improving production that you're actually seeing with some of the things you've been trying to do. And I was curious if you could help us sort of walk through, is this your initiatives playing out? Or is this more a function of your willingness now to write more homeowners and basically, having gone through a period of reunderwriting and now kind of having easy comps? Thomas J. Wilson: Good morning, Josh. Thank you for the question. Matt will take you through some of the specifics. It's a good question because it really gets to the substance of that, which we are doing which is our strategy is comprehensive, but it's designed to support profitable growth in any environment. And oftentimes, we might get into an environment where costs are going up and we have to raise prices, everybody thinks that it's all about price. And it is currently price is very -- obviously, very important, but Matt has a much more comprehensive program than that. Matthew E. Winter: Good morning, Josh, and thanks for the question. As you correctly pointed out, we have seen some nice growth overall in the business, both on the auto and the homeowners side. We've also seen growth in the consumer household goods, and we're beginning to see some growth in the life and retirement space as well. We don't believe that it's any one particular item that's led to that. As Tom mentioned, we really -- the entire team views this as one complex system, and we try to pull multiple levers on that system and have multiple influences on it that feed off of each other, as most self-generating systems do. So what we're doing now is a function of trying to improve -- we use the phrase bandwidth and efficiency -- so we're trying to lay more pipe and improve the efficiency and productivity of that pipe. So we're adding a lot of agencies and we're adding agencies in a strategic manner. Not just allowing them to grow and develop wherever they want, but to thoughtfully pick geographic areas that have been underpenetrated in the past, and attempt to recruit in a more targeted way. So that would include some areas that, historically, we've shied away from; some of the more non-urban areas, some of the heartland, the middle of the United States, some of the rural areas. And we're approaching that in a fairly thoughtful way using a bunch of different tools, including our regular agency system. But we're also using our Allstate auto dealer program, which enables us to put Allstate Agencies inside of auto dealerships. We're also using selective independent agency expansion in some of those rural areas to maximize our points of presence around the United States. And then, we're doing a tremendous amount of work to improve the productivity, efficiency and effectiveness of those agents once they are there. And that includes some of the Trusted Advisor work you referred to, where we're trying to take away some of the low value-added work that distracts them, doesn't add value to the customer and just eats up agency time. We're trying to use data analytics, emerging technologies as well as centralized support services to pull those out of the agencies, free them up for more value-added advice, consultation and service on coverage options; and enable them to really do what we think that we have as our competitive advantage, which is to have a local advisor in the community, who actually knows about those customers, can counsel them appropriately, and form a relationship-based business, not just a transactionally based business. The last thing I'll point out on our growth is that while Tom said, and correctly, it's not all about price, it is to some extent driven by our competitiveness and the way we approach the market. And that's not just agent behavior, that's not just our points of presence, but that includes the rest of the system, that includes our marketing effectiveness, our lead generation capabilities, our ability to offer all the products those customers need; not turning any customers away and letting them go to other companies for one of those products. So that's where the homeowners -- opening up homeowners and expanding our product portfolio, and including life and retirement comes in. It allows us to serve the customers holistically, say yes to more customers, and not turn many away. It's where our new rating plans, which provide a -- through broadening the target -- allow us to offer a more competitive price to a broader group of customers coming in. So I would say that the growth that we've achieved is a product of all of those factors, not any one in particular, not any one in isolation. It's one of the reasons that we feel confident that this sustainable growth and will continue, because it's not based upon one lever, it's based upon the system really functioning very effectively as a system. Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay. That's great, Matt. Maybe just a quick question on margin expansion in Encompass and Esurance. I'm wondering if you guys could talk and give us a little bit more sort of the color, the back stories sort of what's creating the opportunities here? And then, help us understand to sort of, to what long-term sort of goals you're trying to drive these 2 businesses to? I mean, when you look at public comps, people make more money and attract business if you're larger and more mature and people make more money at a high net worth business than you do. And I'm wondering if you could long-term drive for these 2 franchises to have profitability to be in line with the core Allstate channel? Thomas J. Wilson: Let me make an overview comment, then Don and Kathy can say. I would say what gives the opportunity as you appropriately classified it, is that it's not good enough. So we have some work to do there. The -- but they're different stories, right. So Esurance, we would like to continue to pick up share in that segment. So we continue to invest ahead of where other competitors would invest in terms of advertising as a percentage of revenues. We could obviously make that business profitable by shutting down advertising and growth and we're choosing not to do that because we want to grow in that segment. The Encompass segment is a different story. It's much more competitive because you're inside the agency. So you have to be more careful as to how you grow there and so it's different set of stories. We're not explicitly seeking to invest in growing share [indiscernible] we're investing to get profitable growth. So Don and Kathy, maybe you can give a quick answer to those 2. Don Civgin : Yes, Josh. As far as the insurance goes, I think we've been very consistent since we put the company together, that our goal is to run the business in a way that's economically attractive over the lifetime value of the business we're writing. That then tends to take out this accounting anomaly of the advertising, which because of the direct model gets expensed immediately in the quarter it's spent, even though it's designed to build value over the lifetime. So when you look at that equation of running the business on economic value, I think you have to breakout loss ratio and I'll say advertising expense separately. On the loss ratio, we still have room to grow. That's what I said last quarter too, we saw similar trends to the Allstate brand in the first quarter. And so we are also accelerating rate increases and taking underwriting actions and there is a need to improve the loss ratio in the Esurance brand over the course of this year. On the advertising side, it's a little bit more complicated. As Pat pointed out in his opening comments, there tends to be volatility from quarter-to-quarter. Part of it is cyclicality, but part of it is what we're trying to accomplish. so last year in the first quarter, we spent a lot of advertising dollars because we were repositioning the brand. This year, we spent less. That you see in the expense ratio going down a little over 10 points. We still ran the awareness ads in the Super Bowl, in fact, we ran 2 of them but we didn't heavy up afterwards, like we did last year because of repositioning. So when we talk about running at -- running Esurance on an economic value basis that includes advertising. So on a year-over-year basis, we continue to look at what the right amount is to make sure that the business we're writing is profitable. But you'll continue to see some variation from quarter-to-quarter. Katherine A. Mabe: Josh, this is Kathy Mabe. Thanks for the question on Encompass. You can see from the investor supplement that we're starting really lean into rates, you can see it on Page 13. But keep in mind, a lot of our rate actions come -- will come midyear and in fourth quarter for Encompass. Part of what you're seeing, I think the best way to tell the stories on Page 18 of the investor supplement. And you can see that we made progress on the underlying combined ratio by about a point, but there is a lot more work to do. From a policies in force perspective, we're about flat with where we were a year ago. And what's driving the net written premium change, is the change in mix, as we really put strong action in a couple of highly unprofitable states, which have high average premiums, and redirect growth to more profitable states, which have lower average premiums. These actions combined will allow us to position Encompass for long-term success. So we're not looking at just short term measures, but how do we reposition -- as Matt talked about -- reposition the channel for long-term profitable growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Capital. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : I remain pretty confident that you guys know what you're doing on pricing, and will keep the margins within your targeted level on auto. I'm less confident that you could continue to grow PIF at the current rate. In fact, you said, I think in your script that you don't think the PIF growth will be materially negatively impacted. Where are we in the environment on pricing at Geico's commentary in Q1. I think it's helpful they're are going to be taking rate actions. Do you feel like you're with the field at the rate actions you're taking? Or maybe pushing ahead little bit and may lose some PIF momentum? Thomas J. Wilson: Bob, I think in terms of your level of confidence and the level of our confidence, the first thing you have to get through is this our problem or is this everybody's problem? If it's our problem, then obviously, the actions we take will be different and the impact on shareholder value and long-term value creation is different then it's everybody's problem. If it's everybody's problem, then the actions we take and the impact on both growth profitability, customer satisfaction, ability to expand agencies is completely different. So we feel like this is, at this point, everybody's problem. Matt can help you understand why we believe that's the case. And if you look at the relative amount of increases necessary to account for increased cost of auto insurance, and that's all that we're talking about in this particular case is auto insurance, not the broad portfolio we have. If you're just talking about auto insurance, it's relatively small dollars when it comes to amount per customer per year. Matthew E. Winter: Yes. Bob, it's Matt. Let me expand a little bit on what Tom just said. As we talked about last quarter actually, the frequency pressure is a combination of miles driven and weather. And I believe I said, last quarter, we thought that miles driven was about 3x as influential as the weather, that pattern seems [indiscernible] pulled up again, this quarter. But we want to validate that and verify it and as Pat referred to in his opening remarks, we did a very intense deep dive into our business to ensure that the increases in the frequency we're seeing are proportional and consistent across multiple segments of the business, no matter how you cut it. To make sure, in effect, that these aren't our problems, but are, in fact, external. And so we looked at new and renewal business, we looked higher growth states versus lower growth states. We looked across quality characteristics. We looked across driver age, household composition, insurance scores, full coverage versus liability, across different rating plans to see whether or not perhaps, the rating plans had influenced it. And all of that review has showed that this trend is externally driven, primarily by miles driven. And then we wanted to validate that. And so we've looked at external data on miles driven. And miles driven February year-to-date was 3.9% above prior year. The 12-month moving average on miles driven is 2.8% above the 5-year average. So we see it from external data. And then we're fortunate because we keep our Drivewise device in the car for an extended period of time. We're able to look at that data on an ongoing basis. And so we have our own specific proprietary data that shows miles driven up a consistent amount to what we see in external data sources. So we validated it with our internal data, we validated it with external data. And then, we looked at other sources to ensure that, that in fact, is true. And I switched my reading material. If you look at CollisionWeek Magazine, that periodical, it reported January production for the auto body repair industry was 6.8% higher than January of 2014. That's a huge increase for increased activity in body shop. So we looked at that and then we looked on the weather side. And for those of you in the Northeast, you experienced most of this. You experienced winter storm, Juno. You saw the coldest February ever recorded in Connecticut and Upstate New York. You saw the second coldest February on record in New York. You saw 200 car pileups in Michigan in January, one of the largest on record. And so we saw precipitation increases and freeze increases in the first quarter that were pretty much unprecedented. So you look at all of that and you come to the conclusion that in fact, this is an external trend. So given that it's an external trend, we believe that our competitors will react to it the same way we will react to it. I don't think they will react to it with a level of sophistication and granularity, we might, or in the exact same ways, but they will have to react to the trends. As I mentioned in my earlier response, competitiveness is not just rate. But if you do look at rate, we saw the auto insurance CPI up 5.9% for March. 5.9% up from February CPI of 5.6% and the 2014 full year auto insurance CPI of 4.2%. So the average premiums paid by customers has been steadily increasing. Then we look at [ph] and we look at competitor rate increases and we believe we're going to be part of the path taken by rates. So as a result, it's going to come down to execution and not just execution on how we take rate and how carefully we do it, but how we execute on the rest of the system, all those other factors; trusted advise from agents, service, product design, excellent claim service, effectiveness of our advertising, the productivity and efficiency in the agencies, their ability to close the business quickly and we feel confident. I feel very confident that the team will manage through this. I like this kind of competition. I think we are very well-suited to deal with it effectively and rise to the top of it. So it does not concern us. Thomas J. Wilson: Bob, let me add something on top of that. First, it's not one product and it's not one market. So -- because we have a couple of competitors where you can see their results and they are one-product companies, we end up tending to focus on just auto. We have a broad-based growth plan as Matt talked about earlier. And so I just want to double-underline what he said earlier, which is broad-based. Secondly, it's not just one market, like, because we report the numbers on a countrywide basis, we tend to have that conversation there, but that's not the way the business has been run. So there are many markets. So if you look at the top 11 states, 6 of them are growing at higher than 3%, but that also means that 5 are growing at less than 3%, in fact, 4 of them are kind of hovering around 0, I think, Matt. So you're -- we don't have to react. We don't react across the country, we react to every local market. And so the results you see, reflect what we've been doing for the last couple of years. And they will reflect the way we go forward in the future. Operator : Our next lesson comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : And to just follow up on Bob's question. Just in terms of the action plan you're taking on pricing side to mitigate some of the impact of rising loss cost trend, I'm wondering when you -- like how much price increase you need to have? And in that price increase, like, do you forecast any further rising in terms of the mileage driven? And also, like in terms of time, how soon can you get pricing into the system and stay [indiscernible] on the others? And then, like I just wonder, going -- are we going to see continued high level, like combined ratio than you desired over the next few quarter as you are taking these pricing actions? Matthew E. Winter: Thanks, Kai, for the question. It's Matt, again. So I think as we pointed out in the Q, I'm sorry, in the Investors sup on Page 13, footnote 9, April rates actually exceeded that of the entire first quarter. So it does take us a while to begin to implement the rate increases. It's a process. We have to recognize the trend, we have to do the filing. We have to do a careful thoughtful approach to it, to make sure we minimize the potential impact on growth and retention. And then, we institute as quickly as possible. So this quarter showed a fairly low-level of filed and approved rates. It doesn't mean it showed us a low-level of activity, because you can't see the activity. And you -- that's one of the reasons we point out the April rate. I would say that we are accelerating some of the rate that had been planned for the rest of the year. But overall, the levels are not something that I think will shock the system. Where rate is not our only lever on managing loss cost. We look at things like our underwriting guidelines. We have correct class programs to make sure we're getting paid the appropriate price for the risk that we're taking on. And so -- and we have expenses. And we will continue to manage all those levers to ensure our combined ratio stays within an appropriate range, so that we earn an appropriate return on the business. I can't predict where miles driven are going to go or where weather is going to go, or what the unemployment rates are going to look like over the next several months or year. I can say that we have a very good handle on the trend. We have a system that's designed just for this in mind, because it's a decentralized rate taking system that looks at each individual geography and manages rate taking by that local geography. And so we're on it, and we will continue to preserve margins. Thomas J. Wilson: Let me make sure you really focused on it. There was a statement Matt made in there, which I want to make sure you're really focused on, which is from a shareholder value standpoint, our auto business generates really good returns, both over time and even this quarter. Okay, so 96.8 was higher than we would have liked in the quarter. But if you look over the last 12 months, its 95.6. That's a recorded number, that's not an underline, that's not anything. That is a really good return on auto insurance. And so we wanted to make sure we continue to earn that return for our customers -- give that product to our customers at the right price so we earn a good return for our shareholders. And we don't feel like we're in a position where we have to react expeditiously because there is something that is our problem. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great, that's very comprehensive. My follow-up is on your reinsurance strategy. Looks like you maintained your, like, retention of $500 million. I just wonder, like, 2 directions on your reinsurance, given the reinsurance environments. But now the pricing is affordable and you have longer-term horizon that 7-year contract now. So on one hand, is that -- what's your strategy to further lower your volatility, basically even reducing your current retention level? And the other direction is really, what about the coastal market? If you can afford to buy long-term affordable reinsurance will you be more interesting expanding into this markets? Steven E. Shebik: So I'll address that in -- this is Steve. I'll just address it in a couple of ways. As you noticed, we effectively placed the same program we did last year, $500 million retention, the nationwide coverage : We kind of rolled over the expiring contracts. We brought $300 million more of coverage as our business is growing. And as you noted, 2 of the contracts above the nationwide program, we placed for 7 years in additional reinsurance market. So that was a major breakthrough we think in terms of our coverage. You heard me talk in the past about we need 7- to 10-year coverage to provide a stability in the business for our customers. So that we thought was a big breakthrough this year by our team. In terms of buying below, making that $500 million less. We look at that and given our capital base, we don't think we need to do that. We're in the business to make good returns, we are making good returns in that business now. And we don't think that economically it makes sense to really bring that down much further. In terms of the coastal business, Matt's talked, off and on, about the optimization of our exposure on the coast. We continue to work on that in terms of agency placements. In addition, to just getting reinsurance, we want to have the people in place, we want to have a spread of risk, not only the coast, but the central part of the country; which provides the most optimal reinsurance buy and the optimal economics for the business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alison Jacobowitz from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Alison Jacobowitz - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just a follow-up on the reinsurance program. A part of it goes out 7 years, does that have positive implications for capital or is that layer just too small? Steven E. Shebik: The implication -- this is Steve, again. The implication is, it's -- we have buy at a high enough level to appropriately meet the capital tests that the rating agencies have. The 7 years is really for us because it provides stability in our capital base and for our customers. Thomas J. Wilson: And this would be Tom. We're way underrated in anyway, so...sorry, I couldn't help myself. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Ryan Tunis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Another quick follow-up for Steve, just on the reinsurance program. Could you guys give us a dollar amount or even just, directionally, what you expect to save on your reinsurance program over the next 12 months? Steven E. Shebik: So if you look at the -- what we placed in the rollover of our nationwide program, it's 1/3 of our program, and market pricing today is 10%, 12% better than it was a year ago. We reinvested a good part of that in buying this other $300 million of coverage at the top. So you shouldn't see a whole lot of savings. If you remember, most of it actually just goes through our rates, a little bit delayed basis. But more than 80% of our reinsurance cost are baked into the rates. So if the reinsurance cost go up, the rates go up as they go down and as they have the last handful of years, our rates actually go down. Ryan Tunis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Got it. That's helpful. And then, I guess just shifting gears to Allstate brand, just a little more color on the 8/10 of a point of unfavorable reserve development in the auto. It sounded like about half is ascribe to litigation settlement accruals. I know that segment, it has been that redundant for a while. I think, because of the severity related reserve releases. Just curious what drove the rest of the noise there? Steven E. Shebik: So let me do it -- look at it in a couple of ways. First, our reserves are appropriately stated in the balance sheet. And we -- they are subject to multiple internal and external use on a regular basis. I just want to make sure we get that out of the way. Second, we do stay that way, because we use a variety of reserving methods and they react quickly to the underlying changes in the data we see. So on the first point, to reiterate that just slightly, the reserves are established by a team under Sam Pilch our controller and under myself. That is separate from our business units. So we have independence in terms of within the company and they are independently evaluated by both our auditors and an annual basis by our appointed actuaries. So that's the process to ensure the integrity of the reserves. In terms of the changes, which is the second point, when we use a variety of methods to enable the accuracy of our reserves -- and when we -- when changes are made in the underlying data, we react quickly, so take a look at particularly, at this quarter, as you just noted, about the half of the unfavorable prior reserve adjustments related to litigation accruals, which really were from many years ago. Secondly, it has to do with an increase in case reserves for our major medical claims. And those case reserves were increased earlier than our past patterns, because of changes we've made in our claim processes to both improve our customer experience and better manage the claims. So while we believe that acceleration of what we think would ultimately have been upward development in the claims, we increased our reserves for both last year; so last 2 or 3 years we had and also this year's severity given the long duration of the settlement of medical claims. So this increase was determined using a variety of methods. We continue to look at those and as the period of time goes along, we believe that the methods will come together as we do the final payouts and the cases are settled. Does that... Ryan Tunis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Yes, that's helpful. And I guess, I had one more. It sounds like you guys are of the view that some of the frequency blip might be an industry issue in general. And I'm just trying to understand, why might we have seen this more at Allstate now and perhaps not in a lot of peers? I'm not sure if it's geographic or anything along those lines. And also just drilling down within the customer base, where are you seeing above average increases at miles driven versus below-average? Steven E. Shebik: I think as it relates to competitive, it's hard to answer that question, right. So you saw the Geico's Q, you can look at Progressive's numbers, you can -- but there is -- it's always a question, in part, of like when you start like you're looking at percentage ups versus absolute levels. So there is some obviously, some state mix in there, there is weather-related mix, there is how you grew your business. So it's -- we can't answer the question as it relates to the other people. We can answer the question which Matt talked extensively about, which is, we don't see anything in the way we have done our business -- and we have the ability to slice and dice our data, as if we were our own competitor, right -- so we can slice and dice it in a whole bunch of ways, and we do think it's comprehensive. Matt, do you want to take the second piece? Matthew E. Winter: The second piece was -- I'm sorry, where we're seeing miles driven? Miles driven is essentially, I think, Tom in the last call referred to it as an indicator of economic activity. And I think that's really a way to view it. And so it's been very consistent when you look at miles driven in those regions of the country that have seen an increase in overall economic activity, lowered unemployment rate or higher investment or higher home construction. There is a whole bunch of different ways of looking at it. But economic activity has spurred miles driven, which has spurred frequency. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : So just a couple of questions here. How important is channels? So if we look at captive versus the independent agency channel, and your ability to push for pricing to offset the impact of these loss trends that you're seeing. It seems like, in retentions looked pretty good in the quarter, new applications were higher. So I'm just trying to get an idea, I mean, is it really just a timing difference in your ability to kind of right size or do you expect to start seeing some pressure from a ceiling on pricing? Thomas J. Wilson: Mike, I would start with, it's really about best value for the customer based on what they want. So if you look at the Allstate agency segment, they want local advice, they want a broad set of products and services. And they obviously, want a good price as well. And so it is price-sensitive. But if you sell them there 2 cars and a house, and a boat and all kinds start raising their price by $15 or $20 a year, isn't going to change that relationship or that value equation in a substantive way. So we tend to look at it in terms of what's the customer value proposition, how you give them best value. That's what the quality of the service and the product is as it meets their needs. And then, what is the cost of it? Obviously, the channel then subjects that value proposition to different levels of competition. So when you're in the Allstate channel, that -- do not really subject to competition from a whole bunch of other people because you've got that local relationship. If you're in the independent agency channel, there is more competition around that value proposition. So it tends to be a little bit more price sensitive up there. And to those people that are in that segment tend to value brands a little differently. They would, sort of, if I know the company that's good enough as opposed to I really have a long-standing relationship and I've been part of Allstate for a long time. That person tends -- that second person tends to be less price-sensitive. So there tends to be more price competition in the upper left of our four quadrants, that's the independent agency channel. There also tends to be a little more competition on the right-hand side of the page, which is the self-serve segment, because the relationship is not as strong. And they're doing a lot of the work themselves, so they can go out and get it. There still is in the branded segment where Esurance is highly focused, a fair some -- a focus on am I getting the right kind of product and service and is it easy for me? So it's not just how do I go get another $5 off on this price? So -- but I would say the lower left tends to be the least price-sensitive segment out of all of them. Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Got it. I guess for Matt. I mean, so taking that into consideration, I mean, you've taken clearly, took some rate action in 4Q that you talked about and you took more in 1Q, then you took more in April. Where are we in the process in terms of kind of getting us back to kind of where we were before we saw this change in trend? And have those actions now sort of addressed the issue, at this point? And you mentioned pulling rate forward, should we expect that you will continue to balance an opportunity for rate in the captive channel to sort of get yourself back to where you want to be. And does the environment -- is the environment at this point conducive to that? Matthew E. Winter: We are earning good returns. We're doing a great job for our customers. Our customer Net Promoter score is up. We're growing the business, we're getting good returns in the auto insurance business. And so I don't want the conversation to be too -- I mean, we are reacting to what is normal in any market place in any business, which is as you have your cost go up, you work to make sure that you're maintaining the returns where you want them to be. The first quarter was a slight blip up. But we're doing what we normally do. Which is what we are trying to explain is, we look to see is it our problem or everybody's problem? If it's everybody's problem we'll just keep compete and keep growing. So I don't think this is about getting back to some place versus being at a place we don't want to be. We had a good profit this quarter. We made really good returns on our homeowner business in part because of low caps. But we didn't make as much money in auto insurance this quarter, in part because of weather, in part because we have to adjust prices reflecting economic activities. The strength of what we got going is we have lots of levers we can pull, whether that's by product, by channel, by customer segment, the way we think about it to help us achieve what we're supposed to do for our shareholders which is to get a good return. Last 12 months, we've had a 13% return on equity, and we just gave back $1 billion in cash. So we think that's a pretty good offer. Michael Steven Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And then, just lastly, I guess, just as a follow-up. Is there a tailwind from more economic activity for your business as well, we sort of focus on the frequency impact, but is there an offsetting tailwind to premium or policies that we should think about as well? Matthew E. Winter: Well, sure. I mean there is couple of tailwinds as the country continues to grow and given where we are, we will continue to grow with it. The other part to that is in the investment portfolio, we are basically long U.S. growth; the way we positioned our portfolio, that being shifting into more performance-based investments and keeping our duration short in the investment portfolio. So as growth goes up, then you would expect to be able to earn higher returns in you fixed income portfolio at some point of time and that would be a huge tailwind for us. We'll take one more question and then we'll finish it up. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I was trying to get your perspective on the underlying combined ratio. The guidance for this year was 87% to 89%. First quarter was 89%. I'm just trying to gauge your level of comfort to stay within the outlook for the full year. Thomas J. Wilson: Jay, if we wanted to change we would've said we wanted to change. I would point out its a full year number, we are committed to that full year number. We see no reason to change that number at this point. Obviously, you would prefer to start a year at the low end of your range rather than outside your range, which we did not. Being at the high end of the range, just means we have to continue to work to get our commitment done. I would also point out that 90% of our business had an underlying combined ratio of 87.4 that's the Allstate brand piece. So we feel like we're in good shape for running the business the way we want to do it. Let me close it off because I know you have other things and we are appreciative of the time you give us. We had good results this quarter, good balanced results. You can see the strength of the broad-base of our business model, which is not just one product, not just one customer segment, not just one investment offering, and investment strategy. We have a lot of levers we can continue to pull to earn good returns for our shareholders. We continue to generate not only good returns on equity, but also good cash returns for our shareholders. And we expect to continue to do that as we go forward. Thank you very much, have a great quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Allstate Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Pat Macellaro, Vice President-Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patrick Macellaro - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome, everyone, to Allstate's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by Tom Wilson, Matt Winter, Steve Shebik and myself, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday afternoon we issued our news release, filed our 10-Q for the second quarter and posted the results presentation we'll use this morning, along with an update to our 2015 countrywide reinsurance program to reflect the placement of our Florida program. We also have posted our second quarter 2015 investor supplement. We strive to provide transparency into our results and trends and to continuously get better. So to that end, you'll find a number of expanded disclosures in the investor supplement this quarter. For example, we provide Allstate brand auto paid frequency in addition to the gross frequency statistics, since paid frequency is more commonly disclosed and used in industry data reports. The investor supplement along with the other documents I mentioned earlier is available on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2014, the slides and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, which there are reconciliations in our news release and in our investor supplement. We're recording this call and a replay will be available following its conclusion and I'll be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. And now I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Thank you for investing your time to keep current on Allstate. I'll begin with an overview and then Pat, Matt and Steve will go through the results in detail. Also here with us are Don Civgin, the President of Emerging Businesses, Kathy Mabe, who leads our Business to Business operations, Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. If you turn to slide two, you can see the financial performance for the second quarter 2015. The primary story for the quarter is that our proactive approach to running the business has accelerated the focus on quickly adapting to an increased auto insurance combined ratio. In addition, we continue to benefit from the repositioning of the homeowners business, make investment decisions that balance risk and return, and invest in long-term growth. Net income was $326 million for the quarter and $974 million for the first six months of 2015, as you can see from the table on the bottom of the slide. Operating profit was $262 million or $0.63 per share for the quarter, which brings the total for the first six months to $878 million or $2.10 per share. Second quarter profit was lower than the prior year, driven by a deterioration in auto insurance margins, which was partially offset by strength in homeowners' margins. Investment income and Allstate Financial income were slightly lower than the prior-year quarter, as expected. Auto insurance margins decreased as higher claim frequency and severity more than offset average auto insurance price increases. The increase in auto frequency is broad based across states, risk class, rating plans and tenure of customer. And while the recent growth in Allstate brand auto policies did increase frequency, since, of course, new business typically has higher relative frequency, this was not the primary driver of our higher combined ratio. Consequently, we believe this is primarily externally driven and supports fast response to loss cost trends. Now, I know many of you have questions about if and how this will show up in competitors' results. We'll explain what our analysis shows, but as you know, each competitor has its own unique position. What is important to emphasize is that we've taken action and will continue to take action to improve profits based on our data. If and when competitors react to their results, it does not change our commitment to profitable growth. We are executing a comprehensive profit improvement plan for all three underwriting brands, it includes raising prices, tightening underwriting standards and lowering expenses. Matt will cover this in a few minutes. The homeowners business continued to generate excellent underlying profitability and growth is accelerating. As a result of the auto profit actions and the strength of the homeowners business, we are not changing the goal of achieving an underlying combined ratio of 89 or less for the full year. Progress was made on the other four operating priorities as well. Policies in force continued to grow in auto, home and other property casualty lines for both the Allstate and the Esurance brands. Encompass policies in force declined. The combination of unit growth and price increases led to a $345 million increase in Property-Liability premiums earned for the quarter to $7.5 billion, which is a growth rate of 4.8% from the prior-year quarter, which you can see on the table on the bottom. Operating income return on equity was 11.9% for latest 12 months. We also continue to provide excellent cash return to our common shareholders, with total cash returned through dividends and share repurchases in the past 12 months of $3.1 billion. The five 2015 operating priorities are shown on the top of slide three and the results for each brand and customer segment are shown below. At the bottom left is the Allstate brand, which represents 90% of premiums. Our strategy here is to increase the local advice provided by Allstate agencies, while profitably expanding the household relationships. We're making good progress on implementing this plan and believe we can execute it, while adapting to the broad-based increase in auto frequency. Policy in force growth was 2.7% in total, as auto policies continued to increase at slightly above 3%. Homeowners' growth accelerated to 1.2% and other personal lines grew by 2.9%. You can see that in the table on the lower left. Net written premium growth was 4.4%, as the largest driver of which was a 4.9% increase in auto insurance premiums. The combined ratio was 98.7 for the quarter, 101.4 auto combined ratio offset attractive results for homeowners and other personal lines. Homeowners insurance had a combined ratio of 92.3, despite $528 million of catastrophe losses in the second quarter. The underlying combined ratio for the Allstate brand was 87.7 for the quarter. Moving to the second largest segment, Esurance, in the lower right, growth in policies in force has come down from the prior year to 6.4%, as we've tightened underwriting standards, reduced discounts, raised auto prices and reduced advertising expenses. These actions were necessary to ensure that the doubling of the size of the business had appropriate pricing, particularly for preferred auto customers. Average auto prices increased by about 2%, which brought net written premium growth to 9.1%. The combined ratio declined by 2.1 points to 110.2 points, reflecting a reduction in expenses. Esurance also made good progress in expanding into homeowners insurance and are now offering the product in 19 states. This will enable us to both better serve customers, while lowering acquisition cost per policy. Encompass in the upper left competes in the independent agency channel which serves customers who want local advice, but are brand neutral. As expected, policies in force have declined by 2.8% in this price sensitive channel, as we've implemented a wide variety of profit improvement actions. The profit improvement actions were initiated in response to our performance in the market before the upturn in auto frequency in the third quarter of 2014. Average auto premium was 4.2% higher than the prior-year quarter, which mitigated the impact of fewer policies in force, so the net written premiums declined by less than 1%. The combined ratio of 115.7 is lower than last year, but it's still too high at an underlying level of 96.5. Answer Financial, our aggregated model, has premium growth of 16% versus the prior-year quarter. Now, across all brands, we continue to invest in two longer-term operating priorities; modernize the operating model and build long-term growth platforms. The operating model is being modernized with the retirement of legacy technology platforms and expansion of continuous improvement practices. New growth platforms such as Drivewise and DriveSense, our two telematics offerings, are expanding, and between them now have 881,000 customers. Now, let me turn it back to Pat to go through our Property-Liability results. Patrick Macellaro - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Tom. Let's start by taking a look at the Property-Liability P&L on slide four. Starting with the chart on the top of the slide, Property-Liability had net written premium of $7.9 billion in the second quarter of 2015, 4.4% higher than the second quarter of 2014. Through the first six months of 2015, net written premium grew by 4.6%, while protection policies in force grew by 2.6%. Catastrophe losses of $797 million in the second quarter of 2015 were 14.9% lower than the prior-year quarter, but the impact was more than offset by deterioration in the underlying combined ratio, resulting in a recorded combined ratio of 100.1 and a small underwriting loss for the quarter. Recorded combined ratio for the first six months of the year was 96.9, which was 0.8 point worse than the first six months of 2014. The underlying combined ratio for the second quarter and first six months of 2015 was 89.1, elevated over the levels we experienced in 2014. Net investment income of $292 million for the Property-Liability segment decreased 16.8% from the second quarter of 2014, due primarily to lower but still strong limited partnership returns in the quarter. As a result, Property-Liability operating income of $198 million in the second quarter of 2015 was significantly below the prior-year result, while the $753 million of operating income through the first six months of 2015 was 9.5% below the first six months of 2014. The chart in the upper right is to help orient you to the respective earned premium contribution our three underwriting brands have for both auto and homeowners insurance. Bottom of the slide contains growth trend information, as well as a view of Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratio trends. Protection premium and policy growth trends are in the chart on the bottom left. Red line represents policy in force growth and shows the continued positive policy growth trend that's being driven by the Allstate brand. Policies in force grew by 881,000, or 2.6% from the second quarter of 2014. Net written premium represented by the blue line grew $330 million, or 4.4% in the second quarter of 2015, compared with the same period last year, reflecting the combination of policy and average premium increases. Exhibit on the bottom right displays the Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratios for the second quarter of 2015, along with some history. Both the recorded combined ratio of 100.1 and the underlying combined ratio of 89.1 were impacted by higher auto losses in the second quarter versus the prior-year quarter. Slide five highlights the margin trends for Allstate brand auto and Allstate brand homeowners. Chart on the top left of the slide provides a historical view of quarterly recorded and underlying margin performance for Allstate brand auto. Echoing Tom's comments on auto profitability, you can see that the Allstate brand auto recorded combined ratio for the second quarter of 2015 deteriorated by 6 points compared to the quarter a year ago. The underlying combined ratio was 97.8 in the second quarter, also 6 points higher than the prior-year quarter. The chart on the right highlights the trends driving the deterioration in the underlying combined ratio. Annualized average earned premium per policy shown by the blue line continued to increase over the prior year in the second quarter, but at a slower rate than average underlying losses and expenses per policy, which are shown in red. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy increased 8.6% in the second quarter compared with the second quarter of 2014. While you can see the second quarter of last year was relatively low, the increase in the results in the second quarter of 2015 was not entirely driven by a low base. Matt will provide some color on what's driving these trends. Similar information is shown for Allstate brand homeowners on the bottom of this slide. On the bottom left, you can see the impact of seasonally-high catastrophes on the homeowners' recorded combined ratio, which was a 92.3 in the second quarter of 2015. The underlying combined ratio of 60.7 in the second quarter of 2015 was a half point higher than the prior-year quarter, but well within its expected range. On a trailing 12-month basis, the underlying homeowners combined ratio was a strong 61.6. Trends that drove the second quarter underlying combined ratio on homeowners are in the chart on the bottom right. As you can see, average earned premium per policy continued to increase over the prior-year quarter, although at a slower rate than in the past, given the achievement of target returns and the subsequent transition to more inflationary rate activity in this line of business. Underlying losses per policy increased 2.7% in the second quarter of 2015, compared to the second quarter of 2014. Allstate brand homeowners frequency was essentially flat to the prior-year quarter, and paid severity increased within our expected range. Now, I'll turn it over to Matt to provide some further context on our auto results. Matthew E. Winter - President of The Allstate Corporation and CEO of Allstate Life Insurance Company : Thanks, Pat. I'll start on slide six by providing some context about what is driving our auto results, how we are thinking through the trends and, most importantly, how we are responding to them. Last quarter, we said that increases in our auto claim frequency trends were evident broadly across geographies, risk classes and customer tenure. We noted that the trend appeared to be driven primarily by external factors, most notably by an increase in miles driven, and to a lesser extent, adverse weather in certain parts of the country. What we observed in the second quarter confirmed that. As you saw in our results, our bodily injury and property damage claim frequency trends were both significantly elevated compared to the second quarter of 2014. As we have noted, frequency can be very volatile on a quarterly basis, and so year-over-year comparisons are difficult. Some of the increase we observed this past quarter was driven by the exceptionally strong performance last year, but our absolute levels of frequency in the second quarter were at the high end of our five-year expected range and were generally consistent with the elevated levels we experienced in the first quarter. The largest difference in the second quarter was that there was not a material impact to auto claim frequency from weather. As a matter of fact, the northeast part of the country, which bore the brunt of the winter weather earlier this year, performed better than other parts of the country in second quarter. We continue to retest our hypothesis around the primary drivers of frequency, and our analysis continues to support the conclusion that these trends are principally driven by external factors. Miles driven and Allstate's auto claim frequency have historically been very tightly correlated with one another, particularly over shorter periods of time, as you can see from the chart on this slide. While miles driven isn't the sole driver of our increased loss trends, it does explain a significant amount of the result. And as you can see, miles driven have continued to increase rapidly over prior year, as the year has progressed. The slope of the three lines is very consistent over the past few quarters. With three additional months of elevated frequency trends, we continued to look for different ways to validate or disprove our preliminary conclusions. One of the more meaningful insights we were able to produce came from an additional analysis we conducted looking at the loss experience of some of our most tenured customers, a block of business with a history of stable profitability. Many of these customers were written in underwriting companies that are not currently writing new risks and were written with a variety of rating plans. What we found for the second quarter is that this group of customers also experienced significant increases in accident frequency, not dissimilar to the overall book of business. This reinforced our conclusion that the increases we're experiencing in auto claim frequency are primarily being driven by external factors that impact our auto book broadly. Frequency also tends to bounce around a bit, so quarterly trends and comparisons can be a bit volatile. When you look at PD and BI frequency over a two-year period and compare the second quarter of 2015 with the same period in 2013, the annual increase is about 2%. As you know, new business normally runs at a higher frequency level than renewal customers. We often refer to this as a new business penalty. With that in mind, we want to quantify this impact in our auto book, particularly in light of the positive growth trends we've experienced over the past couple of years. So we analyzed how the volume of new auto business we've written in the past two years has impacted our results and our analysis indicated that the new business growth rate is having between a half a point and a point impact on the auto loss ratio. This impact was expected and manageable. It is, however, a contributing factor to the higher frequency we are seeing. We continue to monitor new to renewal trends across our 15 local market operating committees in the U.S. and Canada. So, that's what we are experiencing. Let's turn to slide seven and I'll provide some insight into how we are adjusting to these trends. My comments are going to be about Allstate brand auto, which is almost 90% of the auto business. Nevertheless, the actions we are taking in the Allstate brand are consistent with the actions taken by the teams in Esurance and Encompass. We have a multi-faceted plan underway to improve auto margins. First, we are broadly increasing rates to catch up and then keep pace with increased loss costs. Allstate brand auto approved rate increases in the second quarter were worth 1.5% of written premium, which is almost four times the amount of rate increases that were approved in the first quarter. We know this is a number you are interested in, and know that you turn to different sources to attempt to get a sense for what we and others are doing between quarters. Unfortunately, it seems that there is a lot of inconsistency in how those sources identify and report on these rate increases. So I would encourage you to reach out to Pat, if you have any questions on these. In conjunction with our broad rate increases, we are also engaged in very targeted and segmented rate actions and underwriting changes, wherever we identify specific underperforming segments of business. Those rate actions and underwriting changes are taken in conjunction with our ongoing correct classification programs to ensure we are adequately matching price and risk. We've also looked at our internal operations and are taking expense improvement actions across the company, including reductions in advertising, technology, professional services, and employee-related costs. So that's our action plan to address the frequency pressure we've seen. Let me talk for a minute now about severity. There are several trends we are watching that might influence severity in addition to normal inflationary pressures. Many of these trends are related to increasing vehicle complexity. First, there's an increase in newer cars on the road with expensive electronic components. Secondly, there's growth in the average number of parts replaced per claim; and third, we've seen an increase in more labor hours per claim. Additionally, the largest increase in miles driven has been on interstate roads where accidents obviously occur at higher speeds. So while most of our discussion today has been around increasing frequency, we are also concerned about and reacting to what we believe could be some additional pressure on loss severity. As a result, we will continue to focus on operational excellence in our claims operation to ensure maximum efficiency, rapid cycle time and the proactive management of loss cost. Let's turn to slide eight and I'll help you understand what you should expect from all of these actions. The chart on this slide gives you an idea of how much earned premium we would generate through 2016 if filed and approved rate increases had ceased on June 30, which, by the way, they did not. 2015 Allstate brand auto rate increase approved through June 30 will generate written premium of approximately $323 million. The rate at which this premium will be earned by month is shown by the gray bars on the chart. As a reminder, Allstate brand auto brand policies have six month terms, so they take, on average, a little over 12 months to fully earn in a rate increase. Approximately $155 million of the rates approved through June 30 will be earned in the second half of 2015. In addition, we continue to earn in premium from rates approved in 2014, which is shown by the blue bars in the chart. The total we expect to earn in calendar year 2015 from rates approved last year is $243 million. These actions in total will likely result in slower auto policy growth in the Allstate brand. We have already seen the impact of profitability actions on the auto policy growth rates in Esurance and Encompass. So to summarize, our action plans are based on a great deal of detailed analysis of both internal and external data surrounding the recent loss pressure we are experiencing. We will continue to refine our analysis and our understanding the drivers of these frequency trends. Most importantly, however, is that while we continue to do this analysis, we are already taking swift and decisive action to address these trends and bring our auto profitability back to targeted levels. And now I'll turn it over to Steve, who'll cover Allstate Financial, investments and capital management. Steven E. Shebik - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Matt. Slide nine provides an overview of Allstate Financial's results. We have strategically repositioned Allstate Financial to become more integrated with the Allstate brand customer value proposition. Allstate Financial's results for the second quarter are highlighted on the left-hand side of this slide. Premiums and contract charges increased 3.5% when compared to second quarter 2014, as Allstate agencies have become more engaged in selling life and retirement products. Operating income for the second quarter was $139 million, 15.8% lower than the second quarter of 2014. This reduction in operating income was driven primarily by lower limited partnership income and higher life mortality than in the prior year's second quarter. As we did with the Property-Liability portfolio in prior periods, we are reducing the risk of rising interest rates in the Allstate Financial investment portfolio by selling longer-term fixed-income securities and investing the proceeds in shorter-duration fixed-income and equity securities. The chart on the right provides a view of the Allstate Financial fixed income portfolio by scheduled maturity date at June 30, 2015 and the two preceding year ends. While reducing our interest rate risk and repositioning the portfolio maturity profile generates net realized capital gains, investment in operating income will reduce prospectively by the yield on the reinvested proceeds. Moving to investments in the chart at the top of slide 10, following a strong first quarter, our portfolio total return was a negative 0.6% in the second quarter. The income yield has been stable, while our valuations were reduced by higher interest rates and wider credit spreads in the quarter. The bottom of the slide provides investment income and portfolio yield for the Property-Liability and Allstate Financial portfolios and illustrates the consistent earnings profile of the interest bearing portfolio and the variability of our equity investments. The Property-Liability yield reflects prior duration shortening and ongoing investments in low interest rate environment. The Allstate Financial yield is higher and has been more stable than the Property-Liability segment due to its longer duration and the use of its cash flow largely to fund annuity reductions. Slide 11 shows our capital position is strong with excellent cash returns to our shareholders in the quarter. Our deployable holding company assets totaled $3.4 billion at June 30, 2015. During the quarter, we returned $642 million in cash to common shareholders through the combination of common dividends and common share repurchases. We repurchased 7.6 million common shares for $517 million in the open market and under the accelerated share repurchase agreement that settled on May 8, 2015. As of June 30, we had $1.9 billion remaining on the current repurchase authorization, which is expected to be completed by July 2016. Now, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays; your question please. Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Clearly I think the main topic of the call will be on auto insurance and how those margins can be improved. You outline on slide eight the impact of the rate increases beginning to materialize in the third quarter; but I think there's some concern around how fast overall the margins can improve either from the combination of rate increases and also addressing expenses. So perhaps you can give us a bit more clarity in your outlook on that. Thanks. Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Jay, I'll start and then Matt can join in. First, we think this is very doable that we can get margins back to where they were. Obviously, you can do your own estimate. We tried to provide some measure of how much dollars will come through the P&L on that slide that Matt showed. But also, you can look and know that we do disclose that we're increasing our price increases from where we've been so far this year, so you can factor that in. As it relates to expenses, I would say, what we're doing is tightening our belt, but we continue to invest in the future. So, you'll remember in 2011, when we had issues in homeowner profitability, we continued to invest in long-term stuff like advertising and continuing to increase our expenses. Same thing is true this year. We're cutting some expenses, but we'll continue to invest heavily, for example, in things like DriveWise and DriveSense, which is the future for us. Matt can talk about both his prospects for rate increases and expense reductions. Matthew E. Winter - President of The Allstate Corporation and CEO of Allstate Life Insurance Company : Sure. Thanks for the question, Jay. You mentioned rate increases and expense reductions. I'd also remind you that we considered the underwriting actions and correct class programs and things like that a third lever that we're engaging in this effort because we are, in fact, tightening some of our underwriting parameters, providing some increased focus on correct class programs and we'll continue to use underwriting in conjunction with that. On the expenses, I'd point you to page 59 of the Q. We are clear there that the targeted expense reductions will represent approximately 0.4 point on the annualized Allstate brand expense ratio. So you can factor that into your calculations as well. As Tom said, we are accelerating to the extent possible our rate taking and so far we've been quite successful with the states. We're not getting a great deal of pushback. Our acceptance and approval level is high. We are doing it on a micro segmented basis, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. We're attempting to not just take broad rate increases, but to focus them on the specific segments where we're having underperformance or loss pressure, and so we feel good about our prospects for aggressively pursuing that. Obviously, on the slide I showed on earning-in the rate, I have to stop at the end of the second quarter, but you have to hypothetically add on to that what we might be able to take over the rest of this year and into next year, and it will compound and we feel comfortable that we will get back to an appropriate targeted level of auto profitability as quickly as possible. Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I appreciate that. Tom, with regard to the 87 to 89 underlying combined ratio target, given where we are in first half, are you essentially signaling you'll do whatever it takes to get it under 89? Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We made the commitment because we believe we can get there, yes, Jay. Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Can you give us any sense of what you're seeing in terms of auto profitability trends in July? Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, given we just closed, no. Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse; your question please. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, thanks, good morning. I guess the first question is just on the 1.5% of rate that you've gotten on the book. Can we expect that number to be at least 1.5% for the remaining quarters of the year? Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : 1.25%? I'm not... Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): For the Allstate brand auto. The rate increases as a percentage of the starting book. Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the rate increases \u2013 it's 1.25%; that's throwing me for a little bit. So it's 1.5% for the quarter and what we've indicated is we would expect it to go up as we move throughout the rest of this year, up from the 1.5%. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. And then just back to Matt, I guess, on the expense ratio reduction in Allstate brand, the 0.4 points. That's net of the investments you talked about, so we should think about the expense ratio getting 0.4 point better, correct? Matthew E. Winter - President of The Allstate Corporation and CEO of Allstate Life Insurance Company : Yes. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then I guess my last question is just on thinking about trend versus the location specific rate increases. I guess location specific is 3.6%, which actually was a modest deceleration from the previous quarter, and just hearing you talk about your view of frequency, it's sort of 2% and severity picking up. I guess I'm just wondering why the location specific rate increases aren't greater than 3.6%. Matthew E. Winter - President of The Allstate Corporation and CEO of Allstate Life Insurance Company : Yeah, Ryan, the state specific is influenced heavily by mix and that's not really a representative number to look at. Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : As it relates to severity, I think \u2013 Matt's point there was, we have a broad-based approach to making sure we're going to come in where we want to come in and he's just referring to there's no stone unturned. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Understood, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley; your question please. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, good morning. So just follow up on that, if you look at your frequency up more than 6 points and severity like anywhere between 1 point to 4 points, add these together you're close to the high-single digits, so-called loss cost trends increase. So is that pricing increase you're instituting right now enough to catch up for those? And do you expect these loss cost trends continue at these levels that you would need more pricing increases basically to improve your underwriting results? Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, Kai, let me just set the bar. So as Matt mentioned, it is up and your numbers are absolutely correct as it relates to the second quarter. On one of the slides in the presentation you can see the dip down in costs in Q2 of 2014, and what Matt has said is, of course, some of the up is \u2013 that 6.9% is because of that down. But it's also just up higher than we'd want. So we're doing everything we think we need to do to adjust that. Let me maybe make a \u2013 so underneath that, perhaps, as it may be your question about did we react quickly enough, and I think Matt's team has reacted incredibly quickly to this and the system is fully aligned on improving profitability. Just to provide some details to that, when you look at total costs, that's the losses plus expenses, which combines both the frequency and the severity, as you point out, and you compare it to the rate of increases we're taking in pricing, that is an appropriate analysis. If you look at 2014, the first quarter was up a lot because we had bad winter weather. Then it was about the same, as the price increases, the costs were kind of moving along. So about three-quarters of the way through 2014 everything looks fine. The fourth quarter, of course, as you know, went up and it exceeded our price increases. And then in the first quarter they came down a little bit, but were still pretty high. So it was really towards the back end of last year and beginning this year that Matt's team began to accelerate price increases. As we saw things develop in April and May, they accelerated that and increased their activity around profit improvement, which is the plan that Matt just took you through. So I think the system is working as planned. It is highly focused on making sure we earn an appropriate return and reacting quickly. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Just follow on that, you mentioned about that connected rising pricing could negatively impact on your PIF growth. Just wondering, will that be a sort of lagging effect on the PIF growth? And do you still expect for the full year we see some, like, passive growth in the auto PIF? Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'll let Matt comment in specific where he's working, but let me maybe set some historical context. So, our unit growth in auto is over 3%, which is hard to tell whether you're picking up unit share, but it feels like we're picking up unit market share there. Homeowners, of course, accelerating at 1.2% and the other lines are increasing about 3% as well. The \u2013 this is \u2013 Matt mentioned, this'll have some impact on that auto growth line, but this is different than the results we're seeing in Encompass, where we're seeing a decline in PIF, and it's different than the reaction we had when we worked aggressively to adapt to other external conditions called homeowners and severe weather in 2009. So, we do mention in the press release that we expect overall items in force to increase. Matt can talk specifically about the impact on growth competition, what he's seeing even today as it relates to close rates. Matthew E. Winter - President of The Allstate Corporation and CEO of Allstate Life Insurance Company : Yes. Thank you for the question. First of all, it's important to distinguish between impacting growth rate and impacting growth. So, what we said was we expect the rate of growth to dampen a bit as these profitability actions take effect. We have had eight consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in the auto business. We have been consistently improving that growth rate during all of that period. Retention has remained at fairly historic highs. New business has been exceptionally strong. And my only point in saying that the growth rate might decline is we do think that at some point, taking all of these rate and underwriting actions will dampen our ability to continue accelerating. That is not to say we expect not to grow. We will grow and we've said multiple times we intend to continue to add items in here. We just don't believe that we'll continue on the same trend line that we've been on. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Lastly if I may, on capital management, does this frequency issue with the delay, some of your capital management, how do you balance that? Because your operating earnings apparently is down a little bit year-over-year. You still expect this current pace of buybacks, or you'll take them back a little bit to just see how it plays out? And how do you balance also of course with your share price? Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It has no impact on our capital plans. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank; your question please. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Josh. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. So, two questions. First one, you can talk about the methodology behind paid severity versus incurred severity? And what are we seeing and how do those two things differ compared to what you publicly tell the Street? Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Listen, we're struggling with what the question is, because \u2013 between... Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So In terms of your disclosures, when did you know \u2013 is this representing paid losses here? Are these incurred losses? And trying to understand when we see this, what are the chances that Allstate is being proactive and seeing a trend ahead of everybody else versus that Allstate is being reactive here? Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Let me make a general comment and then Steve can fill in here. So, of course, paid is just what we paid out and we don't report incurred. But when we do our reserving, we do it on an absolute claim reported basis. So we look at how many claims are reported, and then we estimate what we think the incurred severity will be. We do that in a number of ways. We look at what's paid out on claims, we look at field reserves. We adjust those field reserves for the fact that they develop upwards over time. And then we have, of course, claims that have been incurred but not reported. So, as opposed to \u2013 some people set their reserves based on a targeted loss ratio. So, they'll say you start the year off and say we're going to write $1,000 worth of business, we think the loss ratio will be 70, so they book $700 worth of losses. That's not the way they do it. I can't speak to whether that is \u2013 how other people do their reserving. I'm sure they're accurate and highly focused on it as well. There's lots of actuarial science and lots of review that goes on for anybody that reports this stuff. So, I can only tell you what we do which is \u2013 and so, the reason we report paid is, it's a good, clean number and it's easy for people to understand; incurred, of course, changes. Steve, I don't know if you want to add anything. Steven E. Shebik - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Really, simply, our incurred, as Tom noted, is the accidents that we're aware that happened. The paid is what we paid. So there's a lag, obviously, in that, but we do our reserving on a very real-time basis, and so that's how it how runs through our financial statements, and our paid is really catches up over time. You can see that in terms of the trends we have between those two lines. Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And a couple of reasons that we do that. First, as it gets into pricing faster when we do it that way. And, secondly, as you look at paid, though, you should also note, it bounces around a little bit as we change claim practices. So, currently, we've changed some of the claim practices on major medical expenses and that's accelerated some of the payments of bigger claims. But we adjust for that when we estimate what we think the actual losses are for the quarter on which we report. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I realize that you don't disclose the incurred frequency number. But given the move in the quarterly combined ratio, is incurred frequency running ahead of paid frequency, or are they the same? Or you just have no comment on that matter? Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We base our profitability based on the number of claims that have been reported and adjusted for those that we think have not been reported. So, it's actually live what happens. So, when we're closing July right now, we know exactly how many claims we had in July, and that's what runs through the P&L. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then another question and I'll get off this topic, but I'm sure someone else will pick it up. Five years ago we said let's just start over at Encompass; it's not working and we need to take major action. We're here five years later. Should I be thinking, even though I can't see it, that Encompass is a better business than it was five years ago? Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. It's a good question and one we talk a lot about. Let me maybe set the really long-term context, and then talk about where we are today. And Kathy can give you some specifics about the profit improvement programs. So, first, we actually bought Encompass in 1999. At the time, it had a combined ratio of 117. We took it down into the low 90's, which was a good thing because it obviously generated a lot of profit for us. The even better news is, we didn't pay much more it. So it generated a good return on our capital. And so, even today, with its results, it looks like an acceptable return on capital. That said, this has been a difficult channel for us to maintain consist profitability. In part, there's intense competition, of course, at the point of customer interaction, and the customers tend to be highly price sensitive. We should be able to leverage both our auto and homeowners insurance expertise to compete effectively. That said, our current results aren't where we'd like them, but we have to continue to develop our capabilities to compete, as you point out, on a long-term basis. Kathy can talk about the things we're doing specifically, today, to get that combined ratio down both on a recorded basis and underlying basis. Katherine A. Mabe - President-Business to Business : Okay, thank you, Tom. Well, as you know, at Encompass we're focused on the mass affluent and we're focused strategically on building core strength around pricing and underwriting discipline, claims excellence, and really good distribution management. And with regard to the profitability challenges we're experiencing and continue to experience at Encompass, we're using a three-pronged approach. So we're looking at the same things that Matt talked about. Rate increases, underwriting actions and expense reductions. And you can see how we're leaning into rates, if you take a look at page 14 of the investor supplement. You can see almost 10 points of rate that we are planning to take or have taken, on the auto line, and it's broad based. It's across 29 states. So 85% of the book is getting a significant rate increase in the auto line. In homeowners, we're also taking rates as well, and you can see that on page 14 of the investor supplement. And you can see, it's even more aggressive in location-specific rates, and we have a couple of really outlier states in terms of problematic performance. We're taking really strong action. And that's impacting that PIF number, that negative PIF number, significantly. From an underwriting perspective, we're focused at agency level actions related to profit and correct class, like Matt talked about. Things like insurance to value. Some of the things that we needed to strengthen to compete in this channel. And then, across the country, we strengthened our inspection standards on homeowners and looked at some of our payment practices around late pays and reinstates. From an expense perspective, you can see on page 59 in the Q that we're down 0.6 in the quarter and 0.8 on a year-to-date basis, and that's from managing our technology expenses, our people expenses, and our distribution costs. So, we've reduced commissions in our monoline auto line of business, because, as you know, in Encompass, we're focused on package policy growth. So, your question is a good one and it's a journey that we've been on for a while in Encompass. We are working aggressively across all those fronts, the strategy around mass affluent, strong disciplined pricing, excellence in claims, and really skillful distribution management to reposition Encompass for long-term profitable growth. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good luck. Would love to see it. Katherine A. Mabe - President-Business to Business : Me too. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. On the Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio of about 98%, how should we think about the trajectory of that going forward? Is it going to get worse before it gets better? Or are the rate actions you've taken so far enough to start to see an inflection point in that soon? Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sarah, we're not \u2013 if you look \u2013 you'll have to do your own estimate, but I think we would expect that, if we are going to be at 89, below 89, we're obviously going to have to at least hold it, because of where we are with \u2013 we're at 89.1 for six months. So in all the actions Matt talked about, the rate slide, all that shows it burning in. You can estimate \u2013 you could calculate that, what you would think it would be by quarter, by fact, and we think we've given enough information about the prices we've already had approved. You can factor in then \u2013 to that what prices you think we will try to get approved and when those will roll in. And then you have the expense ratio number that Matt talked about. On top of that, you'll have to make an estimate of frequency and severity, obviously. And Matt gave some numbers as to what the longer term trends are in frequency and severity. I would say, if you look at miles driven today, they're relatively high on an historical basis, and so frequency is up. Could frequency continue to go up, of course it could, which is why we always have a range and why we're adapting our pricing and profitability actions. So, you'll have to just make your own estimate of that piece. But we are not giving a specific by-quarter underlying combined ratio for auto insurance for the Allstate brand. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And does your guidance of 89% or better, does that contemplate the potential for deterioration in severity trends as well? Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : As you would expect, we've done all kinds of analysis around that. And we have a range of what the underlying combined ratio will be for this year, given that we are six months in and knowing what we know. But also knowing that there's a variety of things we don't know and can't predict. So, there's a range around that. But we felt comfortable that we would be below 89 to stay committed to it. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then if I can just get one more in, on the net investment income, how should we be thinking about the run rate there given some of the changes you made on the duration? Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'll let Judy talk about the specific net investment income. But I'll point out, just in terms of what we have done, right, so if you look at our investment position, we've tried to position the portfolios on the appropriate risk adjusted return basis. We're not trying to be a hedge fund and mark-to-market every quarter. If we don't like the risk per unit of return, then we make changes. And so, the changes we started making two or three years ago was for higher interest rates. And so we shorten the duration on the Property-Liability portfolio. As we disclosed, we started to shorten that duration in the long-term payout annuity block in Allstate Financial and some of the capital accounts this year, because we believe that the return per unit of risk for interest rates was not attractive to us. And then we began to shift into some idiosyncratic equity-like investments called performance based, which generate higher long-term returns on a risk-adjusted basis, but leads to more variability, as in limited partnership returns. Judith P. Greffin - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer : So, Sarah, thanks for the question. As Tom said, we're taking action in Allstate Financial to reduce our interest rate risk, to improve our expected returns, and as a result, you'll see some gains as well as some deterioration in net invested income. As Tom also said, we are taking the actions in basically two places, in our long duration payout block, and there what we are looking to do, as Tom said, is reinvest primarily in equities. Initially, what you'll see is that will likely be in public equities, but over time we're going to move it into more of that idiosyncratic risk that Tom just talked about. On the surplus side, we're shortening the duration, and there \u2013 that surplus account is going to look more and more like the protection account that Tom just mentioned where we shortened duration there and really kept it in fixed income for the most part, even though it's a balanced account. But that fixed income piece to that surplus account is just going to be at a shorter duration. As Tom said, as we look at the risk adjusted return of interest rate risk and just don't feel that we're getting paid to be in the longer end of the curve. Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think the important thing to think about from shareholder value creation is we believe in looking at long-term shareholder value creation, and so when we shortened the Property-Liability portfolio we took a pretty significant hit to operating earnings per share because we thought it was in our shareholders' best interest. You'll see not as large but also a significant impact as it relates to Allstate Financial in the short term because we're harvesting gains and giving up operating income. But we believe that's in the right interest of shareholders and we don't run the place just on operating EPS on a quarterly basis. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney; your question please. Robert R. Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Good morning, Allstate. A quick question on how we should think about \u2013 on the first-quarter call you highlighted that you were seeing frequency ticking up and seeing a need to take decisive action. I was hoping to see that the PIF growth would slow, and in fact the PIF accelerated against a tough comparison. Maybe you could talk to what the dynamics are that led to the acceleration. Is that something we should think is a good thing or a bad thing? Matthew E. Winter - President of The Allstate Corporation and CEO of Allstate Life Insurance Company : Bob, thanks for the question. We spent an awful lot of time and energy getting our agency force engaged, building up capacity, adding points of distribution, adding licensed sales professionals, entering markets where we had been geographically underpenetrated, and over time that along with some of the work we have done on the rating plans has improved close rates and quote rates and we have begun growing and the momentum has built on itself. And so while we have taken a bunch of rate actions and underwriting actions already that growth momentum has been so strong and so systemic that it has still not shown up to dampen those growth rates. But, as we said several times during the call, that has a limit. I don't know exactly when that's going to occur. A lot of it depends upon competitor actions as well, and whether or not competitors are taking rates as well or whether they're waiting this out. It will depend upon the mix in different areas and geographic concentrations of our competitors. So I think that growth is a good thing. Obviously growth with targeted levels of profitability is our goal, and so right now I'm focused, and the team is focused extensively on the profitability challenges to make sure we get that in line and so that the growth yields shareholder value, long term shareholder value in a long term, productive way. Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Bob, let me share some analysis that Matt did as well, which gets to the question of your competitors have better pricing or you are growing by being underpriced, which I think might be underlying your question there. And the data does not show that to be true. So he looked at one measure of competitiveness, of course, is your close rate and that's how many of your customers take the policy after they quote. And while price is not the only reason somebody would close, obviously we think they close because we give them good local advice and have great service, but it is obviously very important. Those states where we have the highest close rate tend to have very low loss ratios, which would lead you to conclude we're not underpriced as a way of driving that growth. If you look at the bigger states, they have lower close rates than some of the \u2013 ones that have higher close rates, which are \u2013 they are more competitive states. But the vast majority of those big states have loss ratios that are below our targets. So the conclusion then is, we're winning through sophistication, not lower price. Robert R. Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Well, I have every conviction that you guys know how to do auto underwriting. The question is sort of what the timing is of getting to where you want to get to. And I think I'd have more conviction if you were shrinking rather than winning due to your good franchise. So I appreciate the answer, and those were thoughtful responses. If I could have one other quick follow-up, your expense ratio cuts, you said advertising. What other areas have you targeted as opportunities to cut expenses without getting to the bone? Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Bob, so it's advertising, technology, professional services and several employee-related costs, and that's what we've disclosed and that's the action that we're taking. Matthew E. Winter - President of The Allstate Corporation and CEO of Allstate Life Insurance Company : Bob, it's belt-tightening. Not draconian. Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Robert R. Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Thank you. Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We will take one last question. Operator : Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs; your question please. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Just I guess following up on Bob's question, if I could. When you guys had \u2013 and I'm not comparing magnitude \u2013 but like when the homeowners business went through a period of difficulty, I mean you guys pulled back from growth, I mean it was no longer even on the table, and you did what you needed to do to get the profitability of that book back where you wanted it to be. And that was very successful. I guess my question is, at what point do you take your foot off the pedal, the growth pedal, not just sort of partially and not just sort of tipping your hat to profitability, but entirely and sort of focus attention exclusively on getting the profitability back where you want it? Matthew E. Winter - President of The Allstate Corporation and CEO of Allstate Life Insurance Company : It's Matt. Michael, let me make sure because maybe I wasn't as clear as I should have been in my opening remarks. One of the bodies of work that we did was to go back and look at whether or not the loss ratio pressure and the frequency pressure was showing up in the growth areas and in the new business, or whether or not it was showing up consistently across the books. And, in fact, when we did that analysis, we saw those old blocks of historically profitable business, long-tenured customers, unrelated to any of our recent growth. We're experiencing significant frequency changes as well, consistent with what the overall book is experiencing. So, the pressure we're seeing is not specific to growth segments. It's not specific to growth geographies. It's not specific to anything related to growth. We're seeing it across the broad book. So slowing down growth, the only part that that will impact is that what we refer to as the new business penalty, which is that differential with the normal new to renewal ratio. And as I said, we are monitoring that closely, and we will take appropriate action to ensure that we hit the targeted underlying combined ratio. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thomas J. Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, let me just close to say, first, Allstate's operating philosophy is profitable growth. When you compete in an industry that has an overall return on capital below our targets that means you have to have the guiding principle that profit is the biggest driver of shareholder value. Obviously, you have to be sophisticated and you have to react quickly, all of which we're doing. We've done this before, whether that's in homeowners or other businesses. We do are proactive in managing shareholder value on a long-term basis. So, for example, in the investment portfolio, we are willing to give up operating earnings per share, if we believe it creates long-term shareholder value. And we'll continue to operate with that philosophy of creating shareholder value. So, we expect to continue to drive results and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Patrick Macellaro - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome, everyone, to Allstate's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by Tom Wilson, Steve Shebik and myself, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday afternoon we issued our news release, filed our 10-Q for the third quarter and posted the results presentation we will use this morning, along with our third quarter 2015 investor supplement. All of these documents are available on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2014, the slides and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release and our investor supplement. We're recording this call and a replay will be available following its conclusion and I'll be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. Now, we'll turn it over Tom. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Thank you for investing time to keep up on our progress at Allstate. I'll cover an overview of results and then Pat, Steve will go through the details. Our operating team is also here to provide additional perspective when we get to the dialogue section. Let's begin on slide 2. We had good overall earnings this quarter, primarily reflecting the continued strength of our homeowners' insurance business. As you know, we repositioned this business so the underlying combined ratio would support good annual returns, even with high catastrophe losses. This quarter, we also benefited from lower catastrophe losses than this quarter last year. This continued strength in homeowners has also led us to reduce the capital requirements for this line, which has now become a competitive advantage. We also made progress in improving auto insurance returns. As you know, in the fourth quarter of last year the combined ratio on this business began to rise, which reflected an increased frequency of losses and higher severity per claim. As a result, we instituted a comprehensive program based on the business model and practices that have been highly successful, really the last 14 years. That, of course, includes raising auto insurance rates for the first nine months of 2015, the approved rate increase. This is in absolute dollars, was about twice the amounts achieved in the average of two prior years. That increase in improved rates has begun to be realized in premiums earned, but of course, the impact will continue to increase over the next year as policies renews. We also made underwriting standards more restrictive, which has the effect of reducing the higher loss ratio new business. As a result, Allstate brand auto policy growth declined at 3.1% with larger reductions at Esurance and Encompass. Given the cost trends we and others are experiencing in auto repairs, there is also a heightened focus on both effectively and efficiently managing claim loss costs. We also reduced advertising expenses and took some other actions so that the underwriting expense ratio in the quarter declined by 1.4 points to 24.9. Now, all of these actions are well thought out. We balanced short-term profitability and long-term economic value creation per share holders. In addition, they are tightly integrated and implemented in a highly targeted and local manner. The recorded combined ratio for the quarter is 93.6, which generated $491 million of underwriting income. The underlying combined ratio for the first nine months of 2015 was 89.1. That's slightly above the outlook we established at the beginning of the year of 87 to 89. We now expect a full year underlying combined ratio to be no higher than 89.5. Common shareholders received $2.6 billion in cash so far this year, due in part to an 8% reduction in a number of shares outstanding. If you move to the box, on the bottom of the slide, operating income was $610 million or $1.52 per share, which is 9.4% higher than the prior year quarter, which you can see in that little red box. Premiums earned were up 4.7%, reflecting an increase in average premiums and a 2.3% increase in the number of items in force. The overall return on equity was 12% on both an operating and net income basis. Let's move on to slide 3. We'll go through the results for the individual segments. Our five operating priorities for the year are shown at the top and those have not changed. The Allstate brand in the lower left is our largest segment, of course, and it comprises about 90% of premiums written and serves customers who prefer branded product and value, local advice and assistance. This business continued its moderate growth across all the product lines, as you can see from the first line in that box. Total policies in force are 2.5% higher than last year's third quarter. Auto insurance growth did decline slightly in the quarter. Homeowner's policy growth up slightly and other personalized policies grew at 3%.The underlying combined ratio for this segment was 88.3, as you can see in the red box at the bottom. Esurance, on the lower right, serves customers that prefer branded product but are comfortable handling their own insurance needs. Growth continued to slow in the segment and was 3.7% versus the prior year. The reduction in auto insurance growth as a percentage absolutely was not offset by the high percentage growth in other product lines, such as homeowner's insurance. The underlying loss ratio did improve and was 105.3 for the third quarter. Encompass, in the upper left, is the smallest segment that we underwrite for and competes for customers that want local advice but are less concerned about the choice of insurance company. Encompass primarily sells a packaged auto and homeowner's insurance policy through independent agencies. This business has gotten smaller and policies in force are down 5.7% from a year ago due to lower retention and less new business. We took aggressive action to improve profitability in both auto and home homeowner's insurance. The underlying combined ratio is 90.9 for the quarter. Answer Financial in the upper right serves brand neutral, self-serve customers and competes in a relatively small segment of the market with aggregators such as Google Compare. Total nonproprietary written premiums of $443 million for the first nine months of 2015 are 11.2% above the same period in a prior year. Now, overall operating results were in line with our expectations and we remain committed to increasing shareholder value by generating good returns, growing profits and providing cash to shareholders. Pat will now go through the Property-Liability results in more detail. Patrick Macellaro - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Tom. Let's start by taking a look at the Property-Liability P&L on slide 4. Starting with the chart on the top of the slide, Property-Liability net written premium was $8.1 billion in the third quarter of 2015. It was 4.2% higher than the third quarter of 2014, reflecting the combination of policy and average premium increases, predominantly from Allstate brand auto and homeowners. For the first nine months of 2015, net written premium grew by 4.5%, while policies in force grew by 2.3%. Property-Liability policies in force were 34.7 million at the end of September. I should note this excludes 5.6 million Allstate Financial policies and 2.1 million Good Hands Roadside relationships. Catastrophe losses of $270 million in the third quarter of 2015 were $247 million lower than the prior year quarter. Recorded combined ratio for the third quarter of 2015 was 93.6, which is one-tenth of a point worse than the prior year quarter. First nine months of 2015, the recorded combined ratio was 95.8, which was 0.6 of a point worse than first nine months of 2014. The underlying combined ratio for the third quarter of 2015 was 89.3 and the underlying combined ratio for the first nine months of 2015 was 89.1, both elevated over the results we experienced in 2014. Property-Liability operating income of $550 million in the third quarter of 2015 was half a percent below the prior year result, while the $1.3 billion of operating income through the first nine months of 2015 was 5.9% below the first nine months of 2014. Bottom of the slide contains growth trend information as well as a view of the Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratio trends. Premium and policy growth trends are in the chart on the bottom left. We mentioned the drivers of premium trend shown in the blue line earlier. The red line represents policy in force growth and shows the slowing policy growth trend that's being driven by auto profit improvement actions in all three brands. Policy in force grew by 772,000, or 2.3% from the third quarter of 2014. Exhibit on the bottom right displays the Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratios for the third quarter of 2015. Both the recorded and underlying combined ratios were impacted by higher auto losses in the third quarter of 2015 versus the prior year quarter. Slide 5 highlights margin trends for Allstate brand auto and Allstate brand homeowners. The chart on the top left of the slide provides a view of quarterly underlying margin performance for Allstate brand auto. Third quarter results were impacted by higher frequency and severity than the prior year quarter, resulting in a 5.2 point deterioration in the underlying combined ratio from what we experienced in the third quarter of 2014. On a sequential basis, the combined ratio was 0.3 of a point higher in the third quarter of 2015 versus the second quarter of 2015. The chart on the right highlights the trends driving the change in the underlying combined ratio. Annualized average earned premium per policy, shown in the blue line, is beginning to pick up momentum given rate increases implemented throughout 2015. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy increased compared with the third quarter of 2014, influenced by higher frequency and severity but lower expenses per policy. Similar information is shown for Allstate brand homeowners on the bottom of this slide. On the bottom left, you can see the impact of low catastrophes in the homeowner's recorded combined ratio, which was a 72.5 in the third quarter of 2015. The underlying combined ratio of 60.9 in the third quarter of 2015 was 0.9 of a point higher than the prior year quarter and about equal to this year's second quarter. On a trailing four-quarter average basis, the underlying homeowner's combined ratio was a favorable 61.8. The components of the third quarter homeowner's underlying combined ratio are in the chart on the bottom right. Average earned premium per policy increased to $1,079 or 1.5% over the prior year quarter. Underlying losses and expenses per policy increased 3% in the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2014, but the difference between premium and underlying losses and expenses per policy is essentially the same in the two periods. Slide 6 provides an update on our multifaceted auto profit improvement plan. Last quarter, we discussed the four components of our plan to lower auto margins, three of them to adjust to higher accident frequency and one of them to adjust to higher claims severity. First, we sought approval for higher auto rates across the country in response to higher loss trends. Second, we implemented underwriting changes wherever we identified specific underperforming segments of business, including ongoing correct classification programs to accurately price policies. Third, we focused on claims operational excellence and precision given cost trends. And fourth, we reduced expenses across the organization. While these actions in total will improve auto margins, they will also slow growth. Detailed results for these initiatives are shown on the bottom two tables. Allstate brand approved auto rate increases in the third quarter of 2015 were 1.6% of prior year-end total Allstate brand auto net written premium, or $277 million. This brings the total for the year to 3.4% or $600 million in net written premium. An outcome of these profit actions that auto growth in the Allstate brand is beginning to slow. Property-Liability expense ratio decreased by 1.4 points in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting expense actions taken across the company. You can see the impacts by underwriting brand in the chart on the lower left. The bottom right hand chart shows the net written premium amounts generated by the auto rates we received approval for in the first three quarters for the past three years for the Allstate brand. You can see the total we've implemented through the first nine months of 2015 is significantly higher than both 2013 and 2014. We know that not every customer will renew their policy and that some customers will decide to change the level of their coverage, which will result in lower levels of premium in aggregate than what is shown on this chart. This is common customer behavior and why we believe premium change is a key process that's enhanced by an Allstate trusted advisor. Cumulatively, the rates we received approval for in 2014 and through the third quarter of 2015 will be worth $816 million in earned premium through the third quarter of 2016. This analysis only includes rates approved through September 30. As we continue to evaluate and run our business on a local market by market basis, we continue to aggressively pursue rate increases and adjust our actions going forward to ensure appropriate auto returns. Slide 7 highlights combined ratio and top line trends for both Esurance and Encompass. The chart on the top of this page includes combined ratio results for both companies. Esurance's recorded combined ratio of 106.5 in the third quarter of 2015 was 10.1 points lower than the same period a year ago, given decreased investment in marketing along with the 3.7 point improvement in the loss ratio. Esurance's underlying combined ratio of 105.3 for the third quarter improved by 7 points. Encompass's recorded combined ratio of 101.3 in the third quarter of 2015 was 8.4 points lower than the prior year quarter, and benefited from an 11.1 point decline in catastrophe losses. Encompass's underlying combined ratio was 90.9 in the third and 92.7 through the first nine months of 2015. As you can see in the two charts on the bottom of this page, growth is being impacted by profit improvement actions. In Esurance, policies in force and net written premium both grew by 3.7% in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the prior year quarter. These growth rates are lower than recent quarters, given impact from rate increases, underlying \u2013 underwriting guideline adjustments and decreased marketing in select geography to manage risks. Both new business and retention in Esurance have been impacted by these actions. In Encompass, net written premium declined by 3.5% in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2014. This 5.7% decline in policies in force was more than offset by higher average premiums from increased rates and underwriting actions. As with the Allstate brand, we continue to evaluate our results and adjust actions to ensure we are generating appropriate returns in both of these businesses going forward. And now, I'll turn it over to Steve who will cover Allstate Financial investments and capital management. Steven E. Shebik - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Pat. Slide 8 provides an overview of Allstate Financial's results for the third quarter, as highlighted on the top of the slide. Premiums and contract charges increased 5.1% when compared to the third quarter 2014, driven by growth at Allstate Benefits' accident and health insurance business as well as increased traditional life insurance renewal premiums. Operating income for the third quarter was $138 million, 10.4% higher than third quarter of 2014. The increase in operating income compared to prior year quarter was driven primarily by higher returns on performance based investments, which were partially offset by higher mortality and a lower return from the fixed income portfolio. We reduced the maturity profile of Allstate Financial's investment portfolio in the third quarter by selling longer term fixed income securities that backed long-dated immediate annuities. The proceeds from these sales will be invested over time in higher returning performance-based equity investments to improve the long-term economic results from this block of business. This will include private equity, real estate, infrastructure, timber and agricultural related investments. Although these investments are expected to deliver higher returns, the timing of those returns is difficult to predict and will result in a greater degree of variability in our earnings. Additionally, we will have to increase the capital allocated to this business. While these sales generated net realized capital gains, investment in operating income will be reduced prospectively by lower yields on the reinvested proceeds. Moving to investments results on slide 9, the portfolio total return shown in the chart on the top left was flat for the quarter. The consistent earnings from the interest bearing portfolio were offset by lower valuations, driven primarily by wider credit spread disproportionately on high yield bonds and a global equity market selloff, as you can see reflected in the chart in the upper right. The charts at the bottom provide investment income and portfolio yields for Property-Liability and Allstate Financial portfolios. The Property-Liability yield reflects prior duration shortening and ongoing investment in the low interest rate environment. The Allstate Financial yield is higher and is more stable due to its longer duration and use of its cash flows primarily to fund annuity reductions. Slide 10 illustrates the strength of our capital position and highlights excellent cash returns common shareholders received in the quarter over the first nine months of 2015. We are executing our customer focused strategy from a position of financial strength and strategic flexibility. Our deployable holding company assets total $3.1 billion at September 30, 2015. Book value per common share for the third quarter of 2015 of $47.54 was down slightly from the same quarter a year ago, reflecting primarily reduced unrealized net capital gains. During the quarter, we return $920 million in cash to common shareholders through a combination of dividends and common share repurchases. We repurchased 12.9 million common shares for $798 million in the third quarter and have repurchased 8% of our beginning of year common shares outstanding for $2.2 billion in the first nine months of 2015. Since the beginning of 2011, we have repurchased 32% of year-end 2010 outstanding common shares, representing an $8.2 billion return of capital to common shareholders. As of September 30, we had $1.1 billion remaining on our current repurchase authorization, which is expected to be completed by July 2016. Now, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator : Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your question, please. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess my first question is just on the expense ratio here in Allstate brand. It was down over a point year-over-year, and I think the previous guide was you're trying to get about 0.4 of a point from your expense save initiatives. Does that imply that the expense ratio improvement should moderate from the point plus we saw this quarter over the next few? And I guess along those lines, if trend continues to be adverse, how much room is there to further cut expenses beyond the 0.4 of a point that you called out last quarter? Thanks. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the number should decline. It won't stay up at 1.4 decline versus prior year. There were a couple of things that happened in there. First, we reduced advertising expenses in the quarter because we just don't want to grow as much, so there is no sense in advertising if we don't want to grow. Secondly, there were some incentive compensation adjustments, which adjust for the full year, which has really nine months' worth of change in it versus the three months. But we can talk about the things we are doing. Matt can mention what we are doing to keep overall expenses in line, but it's obviously always a component of focus for us. Matthew E. Winter - President: Yeah, hi. It's Matt, Ryan. Thanks for the question. As Tom said, there were some one-time items that we saw in the quarter, but there are also some more systemic longer term work that we have been doing. In addition to the advertising cuts Tom referred to, we've had a multi-year effort on continuous improvement and process efficiency, which is really starting to take hold now, and that's allowed us to get some increased efficiency out of the system. It allowed us to absorb some of the growth without increasing personnel costs, and we should expect that to continue long term. Some of the cost reductions had to do with some technology costs that we slowed down some very long-term initiatives that we had while we retained the focus on the shorter term ones that were essential to continuing to operate the business. So as Tom said, we won't be able to continue at the current level, but we do believe that long-term there is some additional cost reductions and efficiencies that we can continue to drive in the business. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. And then just shifting gears on frequency, I figured I'd try. I guess thinking back to last year, I think October was when we first started seeing the elevated frequency trend. I was just wondering if maybe you could comment on how this October compares to when we first started seeing it a year ago. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We couldn't comment on that, Ryan. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, thank you very much. So, looking at the monthly numbers, Tom, do you see improvement in terms of the rates that you're getting in? How should we think about 4Q a little bit in terms of the trend, and balance that with seasonality of 4Q? And I know that you're not going to give us guidance for 2016 just yet, but I thought three months ago you were confident that you could probably maintain the 89% ceiling and I guess you're going to go a little bit above that. How should investors think about positioning themselves going forward? Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, you're correct in saying we'll wait until the full year is printed before we do an outlook for next year. We are \u2013 as you point out, we had about a year ago actually, the frequency in severity started to take off and as always, we are highly focused on maintaining returns on capital. That said, we always try to do that with looking at the long-term economics and, of course, that is driven by retaining customers, which lead to higher profitability and higher growth. So when you have a rapid spike in cost like that, we need to obviously recover those costs quickly. I feel very good about the pace at which Matt and his team are executing; Don and his business are going at it. I would say this is the first time it's really happened across the country all at once in a long time. That said, we see this movie every year multiple times in individual states. So it's not like we haven't been through this movie multiple times before. We know how to manage it. It does have an impact on growth, which you can see more dramatically in the Encompass and Esurance brands than you see in the Allstate brand this quarter. You should expect to continue to see some impact on growth. That said, we are not doing it so aggressively that we're giving up long-term returns. As it relates to the combined ratio and the guidance, obviously after the second quarter, we were at the upper end of the range. We were at 89.1 versus a range of 87.89. We had a range of forecast at that time and we said we thought we could be at the high end of the range. We thought we still had a chance to be in the range and we continue to work aggressively to try to achieve that. That said, we did indicate we didn't think the low-end range was achievable. Since then, we've now printed another three months and we're now still at 89.1 and we also have a range of forecasts, and when we look at that, we said there are some outcomes where the fourth quarter could be higher so that we could end up the full year at 89.5, which is half a point higher than the upper end of the range before. And as most of you know, the fourth quarter is historically quite volatile, particularly as it relates to winter weather. But we feel comfortable that all of our forecasts are going to leave us below 89.5. So I feel good about where we are at. I think we are aggressively going after short-term actions. I don't think we're throwing out long-term value creation. That said, we're getting after it because we know that the biggest driver to shareholder returns is return on equity. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's great, Tom. And just about the winter weather in the fourth quarter, I've thought about this a few times. I mean, December may have some inclement driving conditions, but it seems to me that October and November should be pretty mild driving months. How do you account for the difference maybe between fourth quarter and first quarter seasonality in the loss ratio? I would think that first quarter winter weather would be worse than fourth quarter, or maybe I'm not thinking about this right. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I would say there's a whole bunch of things that relate to it. Obviously, you zoomed in on weather. In addition to weather, there is the darkness. So, it gets darker earlier so more of the traffic is driven in the dark in the fall, and obviously in the first quarter. But then you have weather, you have precipitation, you have near ice conditions versus ice conditions in the first quarter. So there is a whole bunch of moving factors there. I kind of look at both of them and just say they're both highly volatile. Those are busy times of the year when people are driving a lot and you do get more action. So there's more range. I don't think there is any El Nino effect or anything like that that we're factoring in. It's just going to be what it's going to be. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Well, thank you for the answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Farrell from Piper Jaffray. Daniel D. Farrell - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hi and good morning. Just wanted to talk a little bit more about the shift... Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Dan, we lost you. Patrick Macellaro - Vice President- Investor Relations : Hey, Jonathan, let's go to the next question. Operator : Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Sarah. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : On the frequency trends, has the absolute level of auto loss frequency stabilized versus the second quarter? And to what extent are you concerned that it could increase further and you will need to take rate increases to another level? Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'll let Matt answer that question. Matthew E. Winter - President: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Components of it have stabilized and components of it appear to still be volatile. And so, at this point, we are assuming the trend line continues to go up at its current levels. We'd like to see multiple quarters at the same level before we call it as stabilized and take our foot off both the rate lever. So we continue to operate as if the frequency will continue. Our plans are to continue to take rate wherever justified and indicated and wherever we're able to in those states after we go through our examination. So, I would say that we haven't leaned back and relaxed yet and said it's all over, but it appears to be operating in a narrower range than it was, I'd say, this time last year when we saw such an out of proportion spike in one quarter. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I would add on to that. What you see are our numbers across the country. Matt and I were talking last night about how certain parts of the country have not had as big an increase as other parts. So it's possible that while some portions of the country may level out, other portions may increase to catch up to where the rest of the country is. So, we are \u2013 as Matt points out, our team is being very cautious about calling a victory. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great, thanks. And then on the last call I believe you said you thought you could get back to target auto margins of a 94% to 96% combined ratio in mid to late 2016. And now that you have one more quarter of frequency data, do you still feel confident in that? Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sarah, I remember doing the \u2013 yes, we can get to the 94% to 96% because we ran there for 14 years. I don't remember making a call on the quarter. I think the call on the quarter will be dependent on a couple of things. The trend you just pointed out, which is, we'll have to see where that goes. Secondly, as we increase rates we are having a great success in doing that today. Our competitors are doing it. There is not a lot of noise in the marketplace yet. But if frequency continues to go up for two years or three years, obviously there will be increased scrutiny. So we have complete confidence that we can run this business with the margins that it's been run at historically. We don't have a good, clean call as to when we will be at that level. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alison Jacobowitz from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, it's Jay Cohen, actually. If you could just follow up on the last question. The frequency you saw in the third quarter, is it fair to say it was generally within your expectations, you weren't surprised by what you saw? Matthew E. Winter - President: Jay, it's Matt. That's a tough question. As Tom just said, on a countrywide basis for the entire system, I would say that's accurate. I don't think there was anything that caught us off guard. There are state-by-state geographic fluctuations in there that do continue to intrigue us. I won't say surprise us, but we are trying to figure out why some of the fluctuations exist in certain geographies. But overall, as a system-wide basis, I think you're right. My opinion, third quarter was very similar to what we had seen in second quarter from a frequency standpoint. I had actually expected or hoped that we'd get a little more stabilization in some of the components. But it certainly didn't shock us or look to be a spike that was totally unexpected. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. It also varies, obviously, by coverage. So we were talking about BI, bodily injury, looks a lot like the level that it started to achieve in the fourth quarter last year. Physical damage is a little bit higher. So as Matt points out, the good news is we have great visibility and transparency and we act to it. The bad news is, like all things in frequency, you can't predict it. Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. And the second question is what are you seeing your competitors doing now? Obviously some have talked about higher claims trends as well, others have not. Are you seeing a general broad competitor response at this point? Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'll give you \u2013 what we do is we look at our numbers. We make the changes based on what's happening to our book of business so that we can earn the appropriate returns. Matt, you might want to make a comment about what you're seeing in the marketplace. Matthew E. Winter - President: Yeah, as Tom said, we make the call based upon what we are seeing in that market and our rate need and indication. However, in every single case, we also do run recent rate filings from our competitors to get a sense for whether or not we are out of sync or whether or not we should be looking closer at the numbers. And what I have been seeing as I look at those is that we have a broad range of our competitors taking very similar rates to us. It obviously varies depending upon their starting point, but we've seen several competitors taking much more in certain geographies and some less in others, but on a countrywide basis, I would say that we do not appear to be out of sync with our competitors. Which is why, in addition to the fact that our agents are able to help our customers manage through these premium increases, I think one of the reasons that retention has held and that our quote and close ratios have held is because we're not alone in this rate taking. Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks for those answers, guys. Operator : Thank you. And we do have Dan Farrell from Piper Jaffray back in the queue. Daniel D. Farrell - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Thank you very much, guys. And I apologize for the issue with the line. My question was with regard to Allstate Financial and some of the changes you are making with the shift in fixed income to risk assets. And I was just wondering what's the lag going to be in getting some of the income from those assets? I realize there will be more volatility. And then secondly, you mentioned some additional capital being allocated. How do you view the ROE impact for that segment with the additional capital? Thank you. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'll provide some oversight as to the strategy and Judy can talk about the timing of income. So, Dan, we have about a $5 billion block of really long-dated liability structured settlements for people who were severely injured, buyout annuities, immediate annuities that have maturities of 30 years, 40 years. If you look at the right way to invest behind those liabilities, it would be to A) make sure you have enough cash so that in the next five years to seven years you always got enough money to pay those people. But after that, then you want to invest for long-term return. And so, when we look at that second portion, the investment pool, we said given today's interest rates where they are, we think buying 30-year bonds to satisfy those liabilities is not the right use of our capital that we should invest in higher return assets. They have more volatility on an annual basis, but when you look at the volatility on a 10-year or 15-year basis, it's actually lower than the volatility and investing in, in theory, lower risk assets like fixed income. In doing that, though, there is a higher capital charge from the regulators. We've chosen to do the right thing long-term to generate capital for our shareholders and economics for our shareholders even though it requires putting up more capital and having a negative impact on return on equity now because we believe that's the right thing to do. Judy can talk about the shift. So what we did is we sold a bunch of long-dated bonds and had some capital gains and now Judy is going to get that capital reinvested into other investments. So you might want to talk about the reinvestment plan and then how long it will take to get the money back. Judith P. Greffin - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, The Allstate Corp.: Sure. As Tom said, we did sell some longer duration bonds out of the immediate annuity block and initially what we're doing is we're reinvesting into primarily public equities and shorter duration fixed income. The long term goal, as Tom said, is to get it into performance-based assets, which we like because it's a little bit more idiosyncratic, brings idiosyncratic risk into the portfolio plus we underwrite each one of those investments and bring them into the portfolio, as Tom said, for the long-term. The kicker is that it takes a while to get those investments, especially the ones that we really like in this environment. What we're doing, though, as I said, was initially putting it into this other mix, public equities and shorter duration fixed income, so we're ready when we do find those higher performing more idiosyncratic investments. In terms of timing, we have had some success over the past couple of years finding those investments but what we're finding in this environment is that we're getting money back almost as quickly as we can put it out because the environment has been so favorable for realization, but we're keeping our head down and trying to find them, and we'll continue to do that going forward. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, Dan, we've made the choice that choose the best long-term economics, if that has a short-term negative impact on operating income, which this will, or return on equity. That's the best choice for our shareholders because we believe in long-term to generate cash. That's what drives shareholder value. And we decide not to be \u2013 make economic decisions based on keeping operating earnings per share up on a quarterly basis. As long as we're transparent, we've found our shareholders to be quite receptive to that approach. Daniel D. Farrell - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. Thank you very much for the details. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Your question, please. Robert R. Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Good morning, Allstate. I'm going to push Jay's question which Matt answered a little bit harder on your upping the range. When you were at Barclays in September, Tom, you said if you saw anything you would have made an adjustment by now, which I thought was a pretty optimistic comment given that you had seen two months of the third quarter. Was there something in September or October that caused you to now do it? Or is there something that isn't taking hold as quickly as you would like? I think all your actions are right and I have 100% confidence you are going to get the underwriting back. But just want to make sure there wasn't anything in the short-term data that caused the change from the Barclays conference commentary. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, when we had the Barclays conference, there was \u2013 we have a range of projections and those projections were largely based off what we had seen through the second quarter. So even though we are a couple months into the quarter, you don't have things like severity and reserve changes and as clean a shot as you'd like on what the full year will look like. Obviously, you get three quarters of the way through the year you ought to have a pretty good sense of where the year is coming out. So the range has come in some, Bob, is what I would say. It's narrowed down. The frequency continued to be up in the month of September. So, that also impacted our view, but don't read it as a huge change from where we were before. I was very clear when we were at 89 once for six months we weren't going to get to 87 because we didn't think we were going to run at 85 for the next two quarters after we had run at 89. So I was very clear, we're not going to be at the bottom end of the range. We still think we've got a shot at the upper end of the range. If I had a clear indication we're going to be above 89, at that point I would have said so. We didn't have a clear indication. Now, we look at it and say we have a pretty clear indication. We're going to be below 89.5. Who knows what October, November and December will bring to us. We're constantly updating severities. There are some things that are \u2013 in terms of severities, that whether it's on the physical damage side where given the dramatic spike in frequency, it had both a stress on the number of people we have in the system and just the system itself \u2013 from itself, body shops are busier, auto parts. So we had to sort through what that was doing to cost. Matt and his team are working hard on that. And then on body injury, as you know, those are long-dated claims. So we want to make sure you get the reserves right and given the bump, the volatility in both frequency and severity and bodily injury, we've had to look hard at those. So, we feel good about the forecast. I don't think you should read it as a huge change. We provide the outlook to give you a sense of where the business is and, as you know extremely well, it is not the only impact to operating EPS. So we try to just do it to give you a sense for the business. Robert R. Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Well, I had you at 89.3, so it certainly isn't a big change from my perspective. I just wanted to make sure there wasn't something startling in September that got you off your \u2013 if we had changed it, we would have done it by now, comment. If I could just pivot to life with a quick follow-up, what's the size of the redeployment and what's the yield loss? Judith P. Greffin - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, The Allstate Corp.: So it was roughly $2 billion of long duration fixed income, and if you look at the portfolio yield on the portfolio, Bob, it's about 5.60%. These were longer duration assets, so you probably should think of them as being a little bit higher yielding than the 5.60% overall yield, and then the redeployments into three-year corporates and equities, so you're probably looking at a proxy of around 2.25 until we get the performance based assets into the ground. Robert R. Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Those are pre-tax numbers right? Judith P. Greffin - Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, The Allstate Corp.: Yes. Robert R. Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cliff Gallant from Nomura. Cliff H. Gallant - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Good morning. I had a question about \u2013 I think one of your competitors in some states are allowed something called premium trend pricing. I was wondering what your comment is on that as an underwriting tool, particularly in a time like this? Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : As an underwriting tool, Cliff, or as a pricing tool? Cliff H. Gallant - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: As a pricing tool. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Sorry. Matthew E. Winter - President: It's Matt, Cliff. Yeah, I can say that we've evaluated the use of monthly rating factors in the past. We continue to look at it. In some situations when you have slow and steady increase in the cost of insurance, it works to your advantage. In situations like we're in now where you have spikes in either frequency of severity, it really doesn't do anything you can't do by just taking rate as indicated in those states. So we continue to look at it. We also know that not every state would permit it. We believe that most of the states that permit it are file and use states anyway. So if we're on top of our indication, if we're monitoring as we do on a monthly basis, we should be able to do anything that that technique allows you to do and do it more targeted, more segmented in a more responsive fashion. That puts everything in an auto play mode. Ours is more of a hands on the wheel mode and that is what we believe is most appropriate in times of volatility and significant changes that we have as we do today. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Cliff, I think often it's interesting as you watch people analyze our results and other people's results. Everybody is looking for an answer to why. Like, why yours? Why theirs? I would say and this is like it's one of these complicated 1000-piece puzzles. There's a variety of things that we all do differently, and the thing to look at really is the way in which Matt's talked about, the way we run this business in a highly targeted, highly local, highly analytical fashion. We use as many tools as possible to compete effectively and get our returns back. So, I don't think there is any one silver answer as to is it geographic spread, is it monthly rating thing, is it telematics? There's a whole bunch of things that go into this complicated business. I would just say we're highly focused on making sure we make money. Cliff H. Gallant - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. If I could be allowed a follow-up. I was curious with the accident forgiveness program if there any \u2013 are you contemplating any changes to that? Do you think that that might be contributing to the frequency numbers? Matthew E. Winter - President: No. I can give that as a short answer. Cliff H. Gallant - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yeah. Matthew E. Winter - President: It's just not used the \u2013 it's not used to such an extent. It's priced appropriately. We monitor it carefully. And that's not a causal factor. Cliff H. Gallant - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay, okay. And I'm sorry, I will ask one more. On Esurance, we've seen such a slowdown in the growth rate. And I'm just curious and from a \u2013 how is that slowdown affecting the organization? I know sometimes when you have such a go-go strong growth company and it slows that it can have an impact on how things work day-to-day. Don Civgin - President-Emerging Businesses, Allstate Insurance Co.: Yeah, it's Don. Let me try to address that. I think there's an interesting twist to the question on how it's impacting the company. I mean, when we put the two businesses together, obviously, the strategy was to use Esurance to address the self-serve market that was still brand sensitive. The business is roughly twice the size it was when we bought it and we've been running it with an eye towards investing for that growth. So we've said consistently, we're running it based on lifetime economic value. That said, the business is about twice the size now. And so, as a larger part of the Allstate portfolio, we do want it to get to the point where that size begins to generate appropriate profitability as well. So, I feel really good about where they are as a business. They had a great quarter. They are on the right path. They've done a terrific job of getting \u2013 in spite of the drop in marketing, getting the company still to grow. If you look at their combined ratio and loss ratios, they had a really strong trend over the last few quarters. Loss ratio is down pretty dramatically again this quarter. Expenses are down largely due to marketing. So I think they've done a good job. Now, having said that, they are still growing. They are still expanding states, they are still expanding products. In the Q, we disclosed, we've still got almost 2.5 points of investment in expansion of their business. So I don't view this as a business that should grow 3% for the rest of eternity. I think this was an important inflection point to consolidate the gains we've had from a volume point of view and get the business to the point where operationally and from a loss ratio perspective is profitable, but we have not stopped investing in that business for growth in any way. And so, if I circle back to then how does the team feel, I think they feel fabulous. They're proud of the combined ratios they're running. They're proud of the fact that they are still growing in spite of lower marketing and the focus on profitability. So, all-in-all, we are delighted with what we've set out to do in the last three years or four years and where they are right now. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And I would say we built a strong team there. So some of the people are those that we acquired and Jonathan Adkisson, who runs it, who's been there for a long time, run it well. The financial person has been there a long time. We brought in some new claims capabilities because, as Don pointed out, you grow twice in size, you get twice as many claim people. Plus we have more Esurance eyes on Esurance cars as opposed to using third parties. So I feel like this is actually a really good time to consolidate our skills and capabilities to go to the next level of growth. Cliff H. Gallant - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you for taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Just wanted to just touch on the expense \u2013 can you quantify, Tom, how much of the expense ratio increase was \u2013 or expense ratio decline was a reduction in advertising? Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Mike. That shows up in the Q. There's a table in the Q you can get to the specific number. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And so I guess... Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : But, Mike, I will tell you. I don't think \u2013 we cut advertising, but we're not doing it in such a fashion that it hurts our long-term brand or market position. We just felt like we shouldn't continue to lean in and advertise and drive quotes when in fact we had tightened underwriting standards. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then \u2013 so, certainly, I mean, the expense ratio improved, the loss ratio is up \u2013 year-over-year it's up sequentially. I mean, is that a lever that you feel like you can continue to pull, like is this a manageable level of expenses for the enterprise to run at in the near-term? Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Matt mentioned what we're working to do. I don't think you \u2013 it'll probably go up some over the course of time. We're not trying to \u2013 it's not like we're \u2013 we really are focused on making sure we do everything possible to get our short-term goals without throwing out our long-term growth or long-term strategy. So whether that's technology, advertising, investing in expanding products like homeowners at Esurance or expanding our benefits business into Canada, we're pushing hard on all of those things. So, I think you should expect to see us manage between those. Are we always focused on cost? Yes. Did we decide in this quarter because we take our outlooks seriously, and we said, let's just not spend the money if we don't need to. So we didn't. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Good morning. This is actually meant as a little bit of a softball question. Could you talk about just how the trajectory of improvement would happen for the price increases over time given the accounting for insurance and the fact that you've got a mix of six-month and one month policies? I am just wondering if maybe people \u2013 at least some people out there maybe have gotten a little ahead of themselves in terms of how quickly the underlying combined ratio improves given the efforts that you are doing, just the natural lag. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Paul, first, I always think your questions are thoughtful. So there's two lines to look at. If you go back to Pat's slide, there's a blue line and the red line. The blue line is the increase in the earned premiums and, of course, what that \u2013 it starts with the rate increases, which we show on the bottom of that slide, then it goes to what you actually write. There's usually a little bit of leakage between there because what happens is customers raise their deductibles, which actually improves \u2013 it still gives you the same impact as raising prices, it just doesn't show up in the blue line, it shows up in the red line in that the severities go down a little bit. But then you have it written and then it takes a while to come through earned. You can track those two, written and earned, and do some analysis of that and actually determine how it burns through. You could also do the same thing in between the rate taken. And so you could build a model that would help you on that part. The trickier part of your question is what to do with the red line. And the red line is our cost, which is obviously frequency and severity, that bounces around obviously by quarter. So you have to kind of \u2013 what we tend to do is smooth it with various portions of time. We look at it on the latest quarter, we look at latest month, we look at it over six months, 12 months, and you'd have to look at the frequency and severity. I think it's unclear yet where, as Matt pointed out, let's just call it, the top of frequency is. It's hard to tell, but what we do know is as long as it continues to go up, our blue line will continue to go up. So what we tend to do is look at the difference between those and what we are trying to do is have the earned premium go up faster than the \u2013 what we would \u2013 the combination of frequency and severity go up. And you can't (56:41) see when those lines cross. And when they cross, then that's when you get the automatic drop in the combined ratio. So I can't give you a specific quarter because none of us really know what will happen with the red line. What we do know is as long as the red line is going up, so is our blue line. And our blue line should go up by more than the red line. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Thank you. And then separate question. I personally cover a lot of regional insurers and they seem to be mostly independent agent channel personal line type businesses there. They are similar and they seem to be frankly having quite a bit of trouble with a lot of scale issues. Given that sort of environment, given what we have seen with frequency, any thoughts longer-term about your independent agent channel, whether or not it needs more scale or not? Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it's a good question. First, I would start with, the independent agency channel exists because there are some customers who don't really care which insurance company they have, don't necessarily have the highest level of trust in insurance companies, and trust a local advisor to help them select between those companies and give them the right coverage because they don't want to do it themselves. So, as long as those customers exist, the function and role of the independent agencies will continue to be important. That role over the last 30 years has gotten smaller. That used to be a bigger portion of the market, but it leveled out at about 30% of the market or so. As technology has helped people do more self-serve and that kind of stuff, it could be under a little more pressure, but I think you will continually see people that don't want to do work themselves and don't necessarily have a trusted brand in mind that they want to pick from. As it relates to scale on the independent agency company that service that channel, scale does matter. It matters more and more each year whether that's on data technology, ability to negotiate lower cost with people. So, I think you will continue to see a reduction in the share of small carriers really in all four of the channels, which is why we are trying to be in all four of those so we can leverage our scale across all of those. That said, it is a slow process because many of the companies you're talking about tend to be mutual companies. Over about half of the business is held by mutual companies and they tend to have an extremely high level of capitalization. And so they can wait a long time before they have to get out of the business. And we'll take one last question and then we'll wrap up. Operator : Certainly. Our final question then comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. Your question, please. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Hi, thanks. Matt, do you view ISO fast-track data as a reasonable proxy for the loss trends you are seeing? Matthew E. Winter - President: Reasonable proxy? I'll get in trouble no matter how I answer that. We look at fast track data. Ian, it's informative. I think it's directionally correct. And I think it is \u2013 it shows us \u2013 it confirms for us what we're seeing in the marketplace. But like almost every third party data source, and this is true for all the rate services that are out there, we look at those all the time and there are some data issues with them. There are some reporting issues from certain states. So, I don't think that they are ever determinative. They are only good indicators. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Okay. The reason I asked is it \u2013 the data seems to suggest that there is more of a geographic bias to what's going on than what you guys have suggested the past few quarters. I was curious if you agree with that part of it. Has anything changed in what you've seen over the last quarter to suggest that maybe this isn't as uniform as you thought in the past that maybe it is a little bit more in certain pockets like California and some other areas. Matthew E. Winter - President: Yes. So, Ian, I don't think I ever said it was uniform. I said it was country-wide. But it varied by geography and, yes, I do agree with that. I think as the Dowling report, the IBNR weekly from the middle of October talked about the geographic differences explaining much of the discrepancy and frequency trends across underwriters, I think we do see that. We certainly see pockets, and Tom referred to it on this call already of pockets of geographies where the frequency trends are hitting harder than others. I referred to it on my last call too. Miles driven is not uniform across the country and when you look at the Department of Transportation reports, there are geographic differences of the miles driven, Northeast actually not up so much, other areas of the country up significantly more. So, yes, I do think geographic differences explain some of it. We see geographic differences. When I say it's country-wide, what I'm referring to, it is widespread. It's not as if this is a localized issue where we did something wrong or we fail to implement the rating plan properly in a state. That's why I refer to the country-wide impact. It is everywhere, but it is at different levels in each geography. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Got it. I got that. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : In a sense, what we are seeing, you see the one movie, which is the movie we report, which has country-wide numbers. We have 50 movies, 100 movies, 200 movies we are watching. And we adjust for each of those movies. So whether it is a particular state, a particular risk class or a particular product line, so we are always adjusting. And that's the way our process in business model works. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you all for your questions and insights. I'll try to be respectful of your time. Just know we continue to balance both the short-term and long-term initiatives so we are creating shareholder value and driving long-term growth. So thank you all and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Pat Macellaro, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patrick Macellaro : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome, everyone, to Allstate's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by Tom Wilson, Steve Shebik and myself, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday following the close of the market we issued our news release and investor supplement, and posted the results presentation we will use this morning in conjunction with our prepared remarks. All of these documents are available on our website at allstateinvestors.com.  We plan to file our 2015 Form 10-K later this month. As noted on the first slide, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2014, the slides and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release and in our investor supplement. We're recording the call today and a replay will be available following its conclusion. I'll be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. And now, we'll turn it over Tom Wilson. Thomas Wilson : Well, good morning. Thank you for investing time to keep up on our progress at Allstate. I'll cover an overview of the results and then Pat and Steve will take you through the details. Our comments today are more detailed on four topics to make sure we provide you with good transparency. I will spend some time discussing our rationale for 2016\u2019s underlying combined ratio outlook, Pat will provide more detail on the auto profitability plan, Steve will discuss the asset liability investment decisions including Allstate's financial \u2013 operating income and the impact that has on operating income. And then Steve is also going to provide some prospective on the overall investment portfolio. That will include both the investments including limited partnerships and energy. Also in the room today to answer any questions on any and all topics are Matt Winter, our President; Don Civgin, who leads our Emerging Businesses; Judith Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller.  So let's begin on Slide 2. We finished 2015 with a strong fourth quarter that was driven by our repositioned homeowners business, continued progress in executing our auto insurance profit improvement plan and reducing expenses. The underlying property liability combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 87.4, which brought the full year result to 88.7, which was within the original annual outlook range we gave last year at this time. The recorded combined ratio in the fourth quarter was 92.0, which generated $611 million of underwriting income. The comprehensive program we implemented shortly after a significant increase in auto accident frequency and claim severities include seeking higher approval for auto insurance prices, making changes to our underwriting standards to slow new business growth and addressing underperforming segments that does both of those, and reducing expenses. This proactive approach however did not offset the impact to the external trend and underwriting profits from our auto insurance declined significantly in 2015. Continued strong results from homeowners insurance and moderate catastrophe losses resulted in operating income of $1.60 per diluted common share for the quarter and $5.19 for the full year. And the return on equity on an operating income basis was 11.6% in 2015, down 1% from the prior year. Common shareholders received $691 million in cash during the fourth quarter and $3.3 billion for the full year through a combination of common share dividends and share repurchases. If you move to the chart on the bottom of the slide, revenues were up 1.2% for 2015 and property liability premiums grew by 4.8%. Net investment income declined 8.8% compared to the prior year and that reflects a smaller balance sheet, which is due to the sale of Lincoln Benefit in April of 2014 and the continued downsizing of our annuity business, lower interest income which resulted from shortening the duration of our fixed income portfolio, and a slight decline in income from performance-based investments. Net income for the year was $2.055 billion, which was $5.05 per diluted common share.  If you go to Slide 3, it shows our full year operating results for our four property liability customer segments. So total policy in force growth across all brands was 1.3% in 2015 as you can see at the top and the recorded combined ratio was 94.9. The Allstate brand, which is in the lower left is our largest segment and comprises 90% of premiums written and it serves customers who prefer a branded product and value local advice and assistance. Allstate brand total policies in force in 2015 were 1.7% higher than 2014. Auto insurance, which is on the left-hand side of that box, new business and retention were both impacted by profit improvement actions but policy still increased by 2.1% for the year. Homeowner policies grew over the prior year at a rate of 1.1% and other personal lines grew by 2.7% compared to 2014. The underlying combined ratio was a strong 87.4 for this segment at year-end 2015 as you can see in the red box at the bottom. Esurance in the lower right serves customers that prefer a branded product but are comfortable handling their own insurance needs. Growth was slow throughout2015 in this segment as our focus shifted to profit improvement. Policies in force were 1.4% higher at the end of 2015 than the prior year and net written premiums grew by 6.6%. The underlying loss ratio in Esurance improved by 1.2 points in 2015 and they neared 75.4. As a result, the underlying combined ratio declined to 108.4, which includes about 4 points due to a number of expansion initiatives. Encompassed in the upper left competes for customers that want local advice, but are less concerned about their choice of insurance company. This business decreased in size in 2015 as policies in force declined by 8.2% from a year ago due to lower new business and retention, which is largely a result of price increases and underwriting changes. The net written premium decline of 2.8% for 2015 that reflects higher average premiums from increasing rates to improved returns. The underlying combined ratio was 92.6 for 2015, which was 1.1 points better than the prior year. Answer Financial in the upper right that serves brand-new self service customers is essentially an aggregator that does not underwrite insurance risks. Total non-proprietary written premiums of $581 million in 2015 were 10% higher than the prior year. So let us go to Slide 4, looking forward to 2016 we expect our annual underlying combined ratio to be in the range of 88 to 90. That range is comprised of a number of key assumptions. First, we assume that we continued improvement in auto insurance profitability across all three brands given the profit improvement actions we undertook in 2015 and that will continue in 2016. We do expect modest increases in both auto accident frequency and claim severity, which reflects the broad based trends we experienced in 2015. Third, we assume the homeowners underlying combined ratio will increase slightly from last year's level and as our profit improvements are realized as we start to realize the benefit of the lower combined ratio we will continue to invest to generate long-term value, which will likely increase our expense ratio. As you know, of course, predicting frequency and loss trends in a rapidly changing external environment is difficult. As a result we put a range on our outlook every year. Now what you also know is that we react quickly to trends whether they are positive or negative to adapt our business priorities, so we are building long-term shareholder value. So our operating priorities for 2016 are designed to build long-term value and as you can see they are generally the same as 2015. Serving our customers and generating returns on shareholder capital are two top priorities and they are central to our plan. When we do these well we grow insurance policies in force. We intentionally slowed auto insurance growth in 2015 to improve auto margins since new business typically has a higher loss ratio than more tenured business. New auto insurance volumes in the Allstate brand declined by 24% in the fourth quarter as a result of tighter underwriting, lower advertising and increased prices. While these actions are necessary they are also flexible. So our appetite for new business will increase as the auto profit improvement efforts translate into a lower combined ratio. The largest factor in overall growth however is the rate at which we retain customers. The auto retention rate declined in the fourth quarter in part reflecting higher auto insurance prices. We are implementing actions to reduce the impact that will have on growth, but what competitors do in their pricing is also a major driver and that is not controllable. So our 2016 growth plans and prospects vary by customer segment. Growth in the Allstate brand auto insurance will depend on the timing of the successful implementation of auto profitability action and competitors\u2019 pricing action. The sooner we see a lower combined ratio, the sooner we will increase new business. We do have growth plans in place for homeowners and other personal lines policies given the attractive returns on those products. We expect Esurance and Allstate Benefits to continue to grow in 2016. Encompass had a decline in policies in force in 2015 and is not yet in a position to grow. So we are still committed to growing policy in force across the company but it will be more difficult in 2016 than it has been in the past. Pat will now go through the property liability results in more detail. Patrick Macellaro : Thanks Tom. Let's start with a review of our Property-Liability results on Slide 5. Beginning with the chart on the top of this page, Property-Liability net written premium of $30.9 billion in 2015 grew $1.3 billion or 4.2% over 2015. The recorded combined ratio for the year of 94.9, increased one point versus 2014 driven by an increase in auto losses, which was partially offset by lower expenses, strong homeowner underlying margins and catastrophe losses of $1.7 billion, which was 13.7% lower than 2014. As Tom mentioned earlier, the year-end 2015 underlying combined ratio of 88.7, while 1.5 points higher than 2014, finished within our original annual guidance range given the strong results in the fourth quarter. Net investment income for the Property-Liability segment decreased 4.9% from the prior year due primarily to lower performance based investment income. Property-Liability operating income in 2015 was $1.9 billion, which was 8.2% lower than 2014. The chart on the lower left-hand side of this page shows Property-Liability net written premium and policy in force growth rates. The red line representing policy in force growth versus the prior year shows a slowing growth rate of 1.3% given the actions in place across all three underwriting brands to improve auto margins.  Even with these headwinds, we grew policy counts 449,000 to 34.6 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The Allstate brand accounted for almost all policy growth in 2015 as Esurance policy growth slowed and Encompass policies were lower than 2014. These policy growth results exclude 5.6 million Allstate Financial policies, which grew by 6.1% in 2015 driven by 11.1% policy growth in Allstate Benefits. Average premium increases to reflect higher costs resulted in the net written premium trends you see shown by the blue line. The bottom right-hand side of this page shows property liability recorded and underlying combined ratio results. The recorded and underlying combined ratios both finished the year strong compared to results earlier in the year given our actions to improve auto returns. The underlying property liability combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 87.4 and was 2.1 points lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. Slide 6 highlights the margin trends for Allstate brand auto and Allstate brand homeowners. The chart on the top left of this page provides a view of quarterly recorded and underlying margin performance for Allstate's brand auto. As Tom mentioned earlier, our fourth-quarter results continued to be impacted by elevated frequency and severity as they have been since the fourth quarter of 2014. Our efforts to respond to higher cost trends to price underwriting and expense management resulted in an underlying combined ratio of 97.6 in the fourth quarter of 2015, which was six tenths of a point improvement from the fourth quarter a year ago. On a sequential basis the underlying combined ratio improved by half a point compared to the third quarter of 2015. The chart on the top right highlights the trends driving the change in the Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio. Annualized average earned premium per policy shown by the blue line continued to show upward momentum as rate increases implemented throughout 2015 resulted in a 3.9% increase in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the quarter a year ago. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 3.2% compared with the fourth quarter of 2014 given the influence of higher frequency and severity of lower expenses per policy. The gap between these two points remains positive but it is smaller than where it has been historically. Similar information is shown for Allstate brand homeowners on the bottom of this page. On the bottom left you can see that the favorable impact from low catastrophes that we experienced for most of 2015 continued in the fourth quarter resulting in the 71 Allstate brand homeowners recorded combined ratio. Lower frequency of fire claims in the fourth quarter benefited the underlying homeowners combined ratio which at 56 was 5 points below the results in the fourth quarter of 2014. Components of the fourth quarter homeowners underlying combined ratio are in the chart on the bottom right. Average earned premium per policy increased to $1085 or 1.9% over the prior year quarter. Underlying losses per policy decreased 6.6% in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 resulting in continuing favorable underlying gap between the two trends. Slide 7 provides some context on combined ratio and top line trends for both Esurance and Encompass. The chart on the top of this page includes fourth-quarter and annual combined ratio results for both companies. Esurance\u2019s recorded combined ratio of 107 in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 8.5 points lower than the same period a year ago given decreased investment in marketing, along with a 5 point improvement in the loss ratio, which is reflective of ongoing actions taken in the business to improve auto returns. Esurance\u2019s combined ratio of 110.3 in 2015 improved by 7.4 points compared to 2014. Encompass\u2019 recorded combined ratio of 95.5 in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 2.4 points worse than the prior year quarter and was adversely impacted by 2.9 points of higher catastrophe losses compared to the prior year quarter. Encompass\u2019 combined ratio of 102 in 2015 was 4.1 points better than the full year results in 2014. The two charts on the bottom of this page show how growth is being impacted by profit improvement actions in both of the brands. In Esurance, policy in force growth slowed to 1.4% over the prior year and continued to decline sequentially while net written premium grew by 5.3% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same quarter a year ago. In Encompass, net written premium declined by 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as the 8.2% decline in policy in force more than offset higher average premiums from increased rates and underwriting actions. As with the Allstate brand we continue to evaluate our results and will adjust profit improvement actions to ensure returns in both of these brands are appropriate. Slide 8 provides an update on our ongoing plan to improve auto returns. As we discussed throughout 2015, our auto profit improvement plan is comprised of four parts, which we have designed to work together to address the higher loss trends we are experiencing. First, we have sought approval for higher auto rate across the country. Second, we have implemented underwriting changes to slow new business and address specific underperforming segments of business. Along with underwriting changes we have also increased our ongoing credit classification programs. Third, we focused on claims operational excellence and precision. And fourth, we have reduced expenses across the organization to quickly impact the combined ratio while the other components took hold. These actions in total helped us to finish 2015 within our underlying combined ratio guidance range. Details to the fourth quarter of 2015 are shown on the bottom of this slide. Approved auto rate increases for all three underlying brands in the fourth quarter of 2015 are worth $401 million in net written premium while the total amount of approved rate increases for 2015 in total were worth $1.1 billion in net written premium, the highest amount of approved auto rate increases in over 10 years. We also continued to intentionally slow new business and make underwriting changes on isolated underperforming segments of business and geographies across the country to improve auto returns. These underwriting actions in conjunction with our credit classification programs and price increases have slowed new business and impacted retention. As Tom mentioned earlier, all of these actions are flexible and they are all driven by local market conditions. We will continue to adjust them selectively for market-to-market as auto returns improve. Maintaining claims operational excellence and precision also continue to be priorities given cost trends that we and others in the industry are experiencing. Property liability expense ratio decreased by 2.8 points in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 and was 1.2 points lower than 2014 at year-end reflecting expense actions taken across the company. You can see the impact by underwriting brand in the chart on the lower left. These actions included reductions in advertising in the Allstate and Esurance brands, as well as professional services costs and lower compensation incentives across the company. The bottom right-hand chart shows the net written premium amounts generated by the rates we have received approval for over the past three years across all three underwriting brands. The Allstate brand represents the largest component of these rate increases accounting for $942 million of the $1.1 billion for the full year of 2015 and $342 million of $401 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Rate and underwriting changes will drive customers to shop their insurance with other carriers, not renew their policies, or change their level of coverage, which will result in lower levels of premium in aggregate than what is shown on this chart. Allstate agency owners and their staff proactively consult with their customers during the insurance review process to arrive at the best coverage and deductible options for their specific situations and needs. We feel that having a trusted advisor to help guide customers understanding of protection needs during a period of rising auto prices across the industry is a key competitive advantage for us. This analysis only includes rates approved through December 31st. We continue to evaluate and run our business on a local market-by-market basis and continue to adjust our actions going forward whether it be through price, underwriting, claims excellence or expense management to ensure appropriate auto returns. And now I will turn it over to Steve, who will cover Allstate Financial investments and capital management. Steven Shebik : Thanks Pat. Slide 9 provides an overview of Allstate Financial's results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015, as highlighted on the top of the slide. Overall we have made good progress and narrowed Allstate Financial's focus and positioned the business to support long-term value creation. In 2015, we continued our efforts to fully integrate the life and retirement business into the Allstate brand customer value proposition, and repositioned the investment portfolio supporting our immediate annuities. Premiums and contract charges in 2015 increased 4.2% when excluding the impact of the 2014 results of Lincoln Benefit Life Company driven by 5.7% growth in Allstate Benefits' accident and health insurance business as well as a 7.3% increase in traditional life insurance premiums. Operating income for 2015 of $509 million was 16.1% lower than 2014 driven primarily by higher life insurance claims, the disposition of LBL and lower investment income. In the fourth quarter operating income of $98 million was $30 million below the prior year quarter driven by a lower fixed income yield and a decrease in performance based long-term investment income. The bottom half of the slide depicts the liabilities and investments of our immediate annuity business. The approximately $12 billion of liabilities payout over the next 40 plus years our investment strategy is to match near term cash flows with fixed income and commercial mortgages. However, for longer-term liabilities we believe equity investments provide the best risk-adjusted returns. As such in the third quarter we sold approximately $2 billion of long duration fixed income securities to make the portfolio less sensitive to rising interest rates. Sale proceeds were invested in shorter duration fixed income and public equity securities, which will lower net investment income in the near-term. Over time, we will shift the majority of the proceeds to performance based investments that we expect to deliver attractive long-term economic returns although income will be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. Moving onto Slide 10 and investments. I will start with our portfolio composition at the top of the slide. We have a diverse $77.8 billion portfolio. Fixed income represents 74% of the portfolio value with $8.6 billion or 15% below investment grade. As we have discussed previously we are increasing and shifting the risk posture of our portfolio to deliver more attractive long-term returns. We traded capacity for this incremental risk by strengthening our capital position through issuing preferred securities, reducing debt, exposure reduction to catastrophe prone regions and shrinking our annuity business over the past two or three years.  We are utilizing a portion of that capacity in our investment portfolio to increase idiosyncratic risk through performance based investing and selectively increasing our high yield holdings. Our high yield portfolio is conservatively positioned relative to the broader market weighted meaningfully towards BB and to a lesser extent single B issuers. We have also managed with [Indiscernible] to certain sectors including metals and mining and energy. Our portfolio breakdown by investment approach is at the bottom left. Within the context of these four approaches we target asset mix that reflects our risk tolerance and liability profile. Our market based core by far the largest part of the portfolio delivers predictable earnings aligned to our business needs. We seek to outperform the public markets and take advantage of volatility through our market based active strategy. We will be growing allocation through performance based investments, both [long-term] and opportunistic including private equity and real estate partnerships and direct investments. The majority of our energy holding shown in the middle table are investment grade corporate bonds. We are conservatively positioned versus the broader energy market preferring midstream and higher quality exploration and production players, which we believe are better equipped to withstand the dislocation of energy prices. With that said this is a dynamic environment, and the implications of the falling energy prices are being felt across the market. During the fourth quarter, 47 million of the trading loss is 82 million of the recognized impairments related to energy holdings. Losses were split between public and private securities. Details of limited partnership holdings in our performance-based long term strategy are shown in the table on the right. Approximately, three quarters of these investments are in private equity including timber and agriculture and one quarter in real-estate, [indiscernible] over the term EMA. Our performance based long-term strategy had strong results despite a lower fourth quarter, with 2015 being our second highest income year. We received significant cash distributions from realization in this portfolio, which have reduced the amount on distributed income related to our EMA investments. Moving now to Slide 11. Net investment income was $710 million in total for the quarter and 3.2 billion for the full-year of 2015. Investment income and yield by business segment is provided at the top of this slide. In addition to a multi-year shift in the long-term mix, we continue to proactively manage the portfolio in light of current economic and market conditions. This includes reducing the duration of our fixed income holdings in both the property-liability and Allstate Financial portfolios with a belief that the markets were not providing sufficient compensation for taking interest rate risk in the low yield environment. To left is property-liability. Reduce our interest rate risk in this portfolio in 2013, which resulted in a lower yield to the Allstate Financial portfolio. Yield is now increasing reflecting our increased allocation to high yield bonds as well as reinvestment in the higher interest rates are continued shift of the portfolios performance-based long-term investments. To the right is Allstate Financial. We took actions in 2015 to make the portfolio less sensitive to rising interest rates. As I covered a bit earlier in talking about the immediate annuity business which reflected in a lower interest bearing yield in 2015. Moving to the bottom half of the slide, at the left, is our GAAP total return. The investment income component of return has been fairly consistent or the valuation contribution was negative in 2015, on wider credit spreads across the market, with the majority attributed in our returns to invest in great securities given a weight in our portfolio. In the middle is our realized capital gains and losses. In 2015, we had a net capital gain of $30 million, which included 470 million of net gains on sales, including the gain and long duration fixed income securities we saw from the Allstate Financial portfolio. Largely offset by impairments and intent write-downs. The impact of lower valuations can be seen in the decrease on our fixed income unrealized gains in the chart to the right. Slide 12 provides an overview of our capital position and highlights the cash returns common shareholder received out 2015. Allstate remains in a position of financial strength and strategic flexibility. Our deployable holding company assets totaled $2.6 billion at December 31, 2015. Book value per common share was $47.34 as of year-end 2015 down 1.9% from 2014, reflecting lower unrealized net capital gains in losses on fixed income securities. Excluding this impact, book value per common share was 4.2% in 2015 versus 2014. We returned 3.3 billion in cash to common shareholders in 2015 to a combination of common dividends and common share repurchases. We repurchased 9.3 million common shares for $572 million during the fourth quarter of 2015, which brought the annual total to 42.8 million shares, 10.2% of our beginning of year common shares outstanding. As of December 31, we have 532 million remaining our current repurchase authorization which we expect to complete by July 2016. Now, let's open it up to call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your question, please. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. Good morning. My first question I guess is just on the expense side. I appreciate there's a good amount of flexibility there whether it's advertising expenses or slower incentive comp. But I guess in the base case that you highlighted in your guidance that assumes I guess some step-up in severity and frequency. How should we think about the Allstate brand expense ratio? Thomas Wilson : I'll make an over a comment and Matt might have some perspective as well. First, you should expect the expense ratio to go up because we this year to make our goal, we did cut advertising, I wanted to improve some of the effectiveness to the advertising stuff anyway which move through advertising. And then we took some nice to do technology stuff and differed it and decided not to do it and cut some other expenses. And if you look at it, over the quarters you can see we increasingly reduced our expenses throughout the year which was a focus. That said, there were a number of things we're investing heavily and in one investment in term of either long-term growth or short-term growth, everything from technology I mentioned to things like telematics. Matthew, you want to add anything to that? Matthew Winter : I think the only thing I would add Ryan, is that as Tom said in his prepared remarks, as we see the combined ratio in each local geography getting to an appropriate point in our loss ratios, getting where they need to be in the profit improvement actions fully taking hold in rate burning in. We will want to be able to stimulate growth in selected areas as long as we're earning appropriate return and growth requires some investment. And so, part of the expense ratio this year will be influenced by our growth plan and when we're able to turn on growth in certain areas and when we want to invest. We're focused on long-term value creation. And long-term value creation does require some investment, but it requires investment with appropriate levels of profitability. And so, it's flexible, it will go up, the degree it goes up will depend upon thoughtful analysis of whether or not we add appropriate profitability, appropriate margin, and whether or not we're going to earn an appropriate return on the investment. Ryan Tunis : Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up is just, I guess in the supplement, you guys a few quarters ago started breaking out gross versus paid frequency. In a way I understand it as you incur the losses based on what the gross frequency is and that's also what I think you guys tend to talk about what the investment community tends to talk about. But the paid frequency number has been running significantly below the gross, over the past several quarters. I'm just wondering how we should think about that, is there a possibility that you've been over-estimating what frequency is? Thomas Wilson : Ryan, at first we think our reserves are properly established. So, we do that in a bunch of different ways. We look at both gross and net. We look at what the original amount -- we do it by claims. So, when a claim comes up, we put up some dollar amount toward, then as they adjust -- more they keep building that up and at least to an incurred. And then obviously we think that we have to factor in future upward development in that. So, we look at that as well. So, we look at paid, incurred, incurred but not reported, and we come up with a number, obviously for things like physical damage claims where they really settled out in about 90 days. That tends to run through pretty quickly. The bottom of the injury where it takes about four years before you get 80% paid out, has a little bit longer trend line on it. And as a result of that longer trend line, you tend to have more process changes along the way because you do things differently every year. And so, that never tends to bounce around a little more. But I think we're appropriately reserved. I don\u2019t think you should think there was more or less in there then than we thought it. It's the right number. Ryan Tunis : Thanks. I'll stop there. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please. Josh Shanker : Yes. Thank you, very much. A two question. Tom, the first one's a revisiting last quarter actually. We talked about the 4Q auto acts and seasonality that did not seem to appear this quarter. In the end, is it just a dream or is there something really there or what do you think? Matthew Winter : Josh, its Matt. Josh Shanker : Hi, Matt. Matthew Winter : How are you? I'm going to refer you to a page in the appendix that we put in there. If you look at the presentation slide 14, there is a whole bunch of drivers of the combined ratio and whole bunch of drivers, are these in frequency. Some of them are controllable, some of them are uncontrollable. Some of them we can manage and some we can't. Even within the ones that are somewhat manageable like new business quality and volume of new business and geographic mix, there's also some things that you just can't predict. Seasonality and weather especially is one of those completely unpredictable pieces of this puzzle. And so, when we look at year-over-year, you can look back, we have some charts to show fourth quarter seasonality that tend to spike up and then you have last year where we had almost no catastrophes and benign weather and this year much more normalized catastrophe year but I would say also a more normalized weather environment. Seasonality is one of those high level generalities that tends to pan out over multiple years, but you can have dislocation and abrasions in that on a year-by-year and quarter-by-quarter basis. So, I would not draw trend line conclusions based upon one or two quarters and how they appear versus previous quarters. Thomas Wilson : And Josh, I don't know if I'm reading into your question but it sounded like frequency was actually up quite a bit in the fourth quarter. So, I couldn't tell what your underlying assumption is. Matt has slide in there as well and the increase in frequency in the fourth quarter. Josh Shanker : I would -- just look in the past and I have always am anticipating fourth quarter being a tough comp every year. My other question, look I listened to your prepared remarks and I know you are going to invest in the future and home owners can change a little bit, but you did an 88.7% underlying combined ratio firm wide for 2015. And you have a 5.5% rate increases coming through on the auto side, that you've guided to 88% to 90% underlying for 2016. It seems to me a very hard thing to believe that there is world where the underlying combined ratio is going to be worse in 2016 than it was in 2015. Are you just being conservative or I mean do you really think that that's the right range and 89% with a plus or minus one around it? Thomas Wilson : We think it's the right range. I think we've been doing this since I became CEO. I think it's like it's maybe the ninth or 10th year that I've done this. We've never missed it. So, we do it. So, that we think it's the right range but that's reasonable. You get a point swing either way from frequency and severity. I mean you can get, as Matt mentioned, you can't predict frequency and to be honest it's really difficult to predict severity within a point. So, that alone gives you two points spread. There have been some years, Josh, where we've had a three point spread but that was when we weren't sure how quickly the home owners business is going to take hold and we did quite well. We got ahead of that and it was faster than we had done in our modeling. But we do a lot of statistical modeling around this. We think it's about right I mean if you are right we will see a lot of rate come through that $1.1 billion. And if loss cost and which is result of frequency and severity keep going up which is what we have in our projections, we'll put more in rate increases. So, no, we think it\u2019s the right number. I am not, we set it up to get there and if you want to assume your case, then that would in the middle of the range. We don't get to a precise, so we do at this tangible point. It's like I like to give just round numbers and we think 88 to 90 will be in that range. Josh Shanker : All right. Well, good luck and I hope it will be even better than that. Thomas Wilson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Your question please. Amit Kumar : Thanks and good morning and congrats on the trend. Maybe two quick follow-up on Josh's question. First of all, just going back to the discussion on guidance and rate increases, how should we think about future rate increases, you've obviously have meaningful rate increases over the past few quarters. Are you factoring in that based on where we stand, that number to diminish or continue to ramp up from here? Thomas Wilson : It will be reflective of our results in the cost basis. So, if frequency and severity continue to increase, you'll continue to see us going to individual states with targeted rate increases. If it moderates, and I think we should expect to see it come down but we can't we don't know for sure. Amit Kumar : So, I guess, related to that is what -- I mean, what are you baking in for frequency and severity here? Thomas Wilson : We have a plan, obviously, that we have frequency and severity, but when we move to do -- when we got away from EPS guidance, which I thought in our business didn't make a lot of sense. We said, we'll give you an underlying combined ratio guidance which excludes catastrophe. So, things we can pretty much predict, we think at 88 to 90 what happens with increases in frequency and severity, we can manage to it with the premium increases we will be able to get next year. Amit Kumar : Okay. Thomas Wilson : We don't give out this specific sub-components. They just ends up being, it helps people do their models but it turns our conversations into one of modeling as opposed to the pace of the business. We feel good about the business where it is, we'd like to make more money in auto insurance even though the returns are above our cost of capital. We've made much higher returns in that at our competitive position and strength enabled us to do that and we are headed down that path. When we get there, we will be dependent what happens with the external environment. Amit Kumar : Got it. That's fair enough. And just like there are some external factors, I know Josh was asking about this. One of the questions you were getting was the benign sort of weather in Q4. If you were to normalize it, would it be materially different what you are looking at in charts I guess 21 and 22 or would it be modestly different? Thomas Wilson : Well, let me talk about, so the fourth quarter we came in and we were able to get with insight our range. So, at 88, seven, for the year. The good weather really was a result -- wasn't really good weather necessarily. The home owners business feel a little better because we had fewer fire losses, which tend to be big losses. I don't know whether that's weather or just luck. We obviously on the other end of that which is completely controllable as Matt pointed out, is expensive. We did a good job getting expenses down because we want to be within the range. And then, the profit improvement actions did start to go through, but Matt, maybe lets -- maybe Matt taken to Slide 15 which shows the frequency. Just so because I think everyone saying it's like benign weather and like we had a big increase in our frequency in the fourth quarter and I don't want you to walk away thinking that it wasn't there. Matthew Winter : Yes. So, Tom referred to Slide 15. What Slide 15 does is show what we believe is one of the primary drivers of frequency as we talked about on almost every call frequency is driven by primarily miles driven but also weather distracted driving, new business volume, new business quality and underwriting and miles driven itself is driven by employment or even gas prices. We know what's happened to both of those over this last year. One of the confusing things is that I have referred in the past to the fact that the frequency trend is wide spread. But I think some of you have taken that to me that it is consistent across the country. It is widespread but it is not consistent across the country, in fact it's geographically varied. And Slide 15 is just some data from the federal highway administration that shows how miles driven as of November versus prior year has gone up in each of the different regions and you will notice that in the North East it only went up 2.9 while in the West it went up 5.5 and South Atlantic 5.1 etcetera. So, this is one driver but it's a major driver and it does help to explain some of the other questions that you've been raising about why different companies have different experiences. They have different geographic concentrations of their business, books of business, and the miles driven in those areas is different. It will clearly impact results. Amit Kumar : Got it. Okay. This is very helpful. Thanks for the answers. Thomas Wilson : Thanks, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Montgomery. Your question, please. Bob Glasspiegel : Good morning, Allstate. Just an observation to when you hit your forecast nine years in a row, I guess it's another way of saying you tend to be conservative with your outlooks because no one is that good to be able to forecast. My question --. Thomas Wilson : And that's your way to say. And Bob, I will say that we have a good system, we have a great team. They are goal driven. They know how to deliver what we said we would deliver. If you had asked me as last year when we gave our range of 87, 89, did I think frequency and severity were in a clip up at above five points, I would have said \"No\". So, the point is you really can't forecast frequency and that what I -- we can do is tell you given the strengthen of our system and the transparency we have our management process is in place, we think we can manage to 88 to 90 next year and so that we've set out to do. If we do better than that, then that will be because we reacted well and did well but we don't set it up so we can be below it. I guess it's not the goal here because obviously as you would expect, you want to be balanced, thoughtful, and transparent with your shareholders. You don't want to under-promise and over deliver because then everybody will think well the whole world's falling apart, nor do you want to over promise and under deliver. So, we try to do it and what we think the system can delivery and we think 88 to 90. We did not set it up to be too optimistic or set out to be too conserved. It's right down the middle. Bob Glasspiegel : I hear you. My question is, I understand all your profit moves and am encouraged by the fourth quarter underlined showing some improvement, which suggest that you are on track. I guess I understand what you are doing in Allstate brand and Encompass, on insurance, trying to slow the growth dramatically, certainly fits within your profit objective and it seems like its own way to go to achieve your short-term plan. But I guess my question is are you where you want to be in scale in that business in long-term and what is your overall sort of long-term game play in insurance, how big you have to be in that business to be a long term player? Thomas Wilson : Let me make an overall long-term comment and then Don can give you some specific. So, insurance is twice the size from when we bought it three years ago. So, and we think it is of scale at a billion six because if you look at normal direct marketing company should be 10% of your premium you would spend on advertising and at a $160 million, that's enough media weight to make sure people hear you. If you're half that size, you don't, you just don't have enough throw weight in the marketing world. So, I think it's up scaled today. That said, we have good growth plans and I don\u2019t want you to think that this is the backing off of insurance growth. Don can talk about the things we're doing to get into home owners and motorcycles and Canada and new market. So, there is plenty of growth up there. We just were managing this year to some objectives that Don had set with the teams. Don, maybe you want to comment about it? Don Civgin : Yes, Bob. First remember when we acquired insurance, we did it for the strategic reason of going into the lower right hand corner with the self serve rent sensitive customer and really focusing the customer value proposition against the GEICO and progressive direct model. And when we acquired it, what we said we were going to do is was run it for economics as opposed to GAAP accounting. So, as you know, in the direct model, your expense, all your marketing expense is up front. And as a result, the first year or the first quarter looks particularly bad when you are growing, but then in later years you tend to make money as the business retains and you don't have to spend in the marketing again. As Tom said, the business is now twice as large as it was when we acquired it a little over four years ago. It does have meaningful impact on where Allstate reports. And with twice as much growth we were having some pressure on the loss ratio. And so what we decided to do this year was slow the growth down, really focus on getting more efficiency out of our model that meant both on the marketing side and on the operation side. And I would tell you I am absolutely delighted with how they responded and how the business is doing. I mean you talk about slowing it down dramatically. It's still growing 4% to 5% in the fourth quarter and more than that for the year, not as high as it had been, but given the reduction in marketing, still a good growth rate. And the underlying combined ratio is down over eight points from last year in the quarter. So, we feel really good about where they are. Having said that, I would echo what Tom said, the business is at scale. It could run at this size with meaningful growth rates I think and certainly do it in economic way. But we do want to grow the business in the future as aggressively as we can. We just want to do it with a balanced profitability and growth. We felt that was getting a little out of filter a year or 18 months ago. We're getting it back in line now. We feel good about what they're doing. And the one other thing I would amplify is, I think Tom mentioned in his comments, we had four points of investment in 2015 that shows up in the combined ratio, but you don't get the benefit of those investments in the current year. Things like expanding home owners which is now in 25 states, renters which is in 20 states, motorcycles in all, auto continues to expand to 43 states and one Ontario in Canada as well. And so we are investing heavily in building our capabilities for the future, building out features and expanding our footprint. So, we have -- I think the answer to your questions, we have very aggressive growth plans for the future. We are investing heavily in that, but we want to make sure that we balance that with the economics and the reported results on a current basis. Bob Glasspiegel : Thanks for the thoughtful answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kaypaghian from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Daniel Kaypaghian : Good morning, thank you. First question on capital management. And it looks -- [Audio Gap]. Thomas Wilson : So, if we look back over the last couple of years, we set up our share buyback program really in a basis of as you put a capital that we have available. We sold Lincoln Benefit Life which we'd both on capital and also the proceeds from the sale. So, we move that up to the parent company $1.2 billion in 2013 and 2014. So, in 2015 we used a fair amount of backup, increased that buyback program but what may normally had been to a $3 billion level we're talking about. In addition, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've done a fair amount of work at kind of bringing our risk profile down in the corporation which once again has freed up some capital. We do need to grow the business at the moment as we said I like that we are going to pool in more money into our investment portfolio to back that into the equity type investment. We will need some to put some money aside, it should grow the business and will also we have to pay our dividend obviously and what we free up essentially from net income, we pay out on a year lag generally in and our share buyback. Daniel Kaypaghian : Okay. So, we're looking more probably like payout ratio run 100% levels? Thomas Wilson : Well, we don't do it that way, then of course where the banks do it, but we do it with [indiscernible] which is so we look at how much capital we need, then we say how much do we earn, how much do we have, and so we don't do it as a percentage of earnings. Daniel Kaypaghian : Okay. It's great. And second question for Tom, it looks the change on Slide 4 of your operating priority seems to be down 16. Two thing, one is the number one is better serve a customer through innovation, in fact, in efficiency. Could you give some example of that and then the [indiscernible] item, basically the long term gross platform now you mentioned about acquiring. I just wonder what platform Allstate current lack that you would like to grow into and what's the [indiscernible] of your acquisition? Thomas Wilson : Okay. So, let me answer the last one in there, let Matt answer the first one. So, first, in terms of priorities, they are all important. So, they are not like we don't fight over which order they are in. And so Matt will talk about the customer which is obviously very important to us, but as important as all the other ones. We did add, was good catching [indiscernible]. We added the acquired to the bill long-term growth platforms. Long-term growth platforms are [Audio Gap] to acquire something to help accelerate those efforts where we would do that. Secondly, we believe that there is additional propensity in particularly the Allstate agency channel but also some in insurance to pick up adjacent products and services which are consistent with protecting and preparing people particularly as Matt makes progress on the trusted adviser model in the Allstate agency channel. We think there are other things we could sell in. We could either decide we want to get into the business, do filings, [indiscernible] and that kind of stuff, it's unique. Or if somebody has a platform that we can buy and we can bolt it onto ours, we would do that. So, that's the concept behind acquisitions. We didn\u2019t put it in there because we have some specific target and I think will not talk about. Matt, you want to go through the customer piece? Matthew Winter : Sure, Kay. So, you correctly pointed out that its customer base. So, it's all that customer centricity and using innovation effectiveness and efficiency not just to manage financials and manage margins but to better serve our customers. And there is three primary tracks of work going on under that category. The first is Tom just mentioned just trusted adviser and trusted adviser is all the work we have underway to help our agency owners and their staff and our exclusive financial specialists better serve our customers through personalized customized tailored solutions geographically based, that are advised based, not product push, that are solutions as opposed to transactions and based on long-term value relationships. And so, we have a lot of work underway there. And that goes to both the effectiveness of our agency system as a distribution model and the efficiency with which we put through product. The second major line of work that we have underway, is we refer to it as our continuous improvement, others refer to it as lean engineering. And we have installed continuous improvement in a good portion of the company already. It's a set of management principles and practices that empower frontline employees, get them involved in root cause problem solving, create flow of information, creating environment where they are engaged in their work and we have seen dramatic increases in productivity and efficiency of those operations that we've installed continuous improvement. We've also seen customer satisfaction and employee engagement in those areas. The third, and this is on really the innovation side the track of work we have underway, we refer to it as integrated digital enterprise but you've also heard me refer to it as a set of projects that take data predictive analytics and emerging technologies and combine those capabilities to better serve customers. And that includes a range of things that both use internal sources of data as well as external sources of data to provide more predictive guidance to our agency owners in serving their customers to help them better serve those customers, tell them what the next logical product for them might be. And to use those emerging technologies to deliver that in a way that's more accepted by the customer, more intuitive to the customer, and is more respectful of the customers time and energy. And so, you will continue to see a lot of focus there. As Tom referred to in his opening remarks, as he explained why the expense ratio may float up a little bit, we will continue to invest in all these core initiatives because they are all about long-term value creation. If we're able to better serve our customers through innovation effectiveness and efficiency, we will create a more valuable organization and we are all about that. And so, I thank you for asking the question. Daniel Kaypaghian : Thank you, very much. Matthew Winter : Hey, Jonathan, we'll take one more quick one. Operator : Certainly, our final question comes from the line of Alison Jacobowitz from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please. Alison Jacobowitz : It's actually Jay Cowan as you could probably tell by the voice. Two questions. One is, you're obviously taking action as you've talked at length about to improve the auto profitability and you suggested that certainly the effect will depend partly on what your competitors do. Question is, what are your competitors doing, what are you seeing out there. And then secondly, relative to miles driven, arguably one of the reasons is lower fuel prices, would you suspect that oil going from 100 down to 40 has a bigger effect than oil going from 40 to 30, in other words the effect one might suggest would be declining over time. Matthew Winter : Jay, its Matt. Those are two really good questions. First of all, what we are seeing part of our competitors, some of our competitors is a significant rate action in the filings that we're reviewing. As we make our filings, we see competitor rate filings as well. Some of them are quite significant, some of them are more moderate, most of it depends upon if you look back three or four years the level of rates they started this period. And so those who had a greater GAAP to cover in order to deal with the frequency and severity pressure are taking greater rates. So, we expect that to generate some increased turmoil in the environment and it will certainly generate shopping behavior in the industry and shopping behavior can be a positive or negative depending upon how you approach it, where you positioned and its all part of competition. So, we believe we are well positioned. We believe we are prepared for it. We believe we are monitoring their actions, but we are mostly focused on what we need to do to earn appropriate returns and serve our customers. And so, I would say our primary focus is always on managing our own business with an eye towards what the competitors are doing as opposed to trying to react the competitors all the time which I find can just drive you crazy. On your second question, it's a great point. There is a point of diminishing impact with gas prices on miles driven. We've always said that we thought the unemployment rate and economic activity had even a greater impact than the gas prices because economic activity impacts employment driving and gas prices typically impact only discretionary driving activities because if you have to go to work you have to go to work and you're going to pay $3 a gallon or you're going to pay $1.90 a gallon. If you are thinking about a vacation this summer and you're deciding whether to stay at home or drive down to Florida, if gases are a $1.60, it's probably going to influence you differently than if gas was at $3.50 a gallon. Now, there is a point at which though it's just plain cheap and it's no longer a question and I think we're probably at that point. So, I think you are correct in that from what we look at we think the biggest influence of the drop in gas prices has already occurred and it's unlikely that that will drive much further increase in miles driven. But that being said, we also don't know what economic activity is going to look like and what all the other influences on frequency will look like. Thomas Wilson : So, thank you all. I will leave you with a couple of thoughts. Allstate has been extremely strong operating platform. First, that enables us to react quickly to whatever peers in the world. Secondly, we proactively manage our risk and return on a consolidated basis, whether it's catastrophes, auto margins, investment returns or our capital structure; we look at it in total. And thirdly, we are focused on long-term value. We pay attention to current earnings because it is set along the way, but we will not give up long-term value equation [secured to earnings] [ph] because we believe that's what shareholders want which is creating long-term economic cash value. Thank you very much. We will talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation at today's conference. This does conclude the program, you may now disconnect. Good day.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Pat Macellaro, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Patrick Macellaro - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for Allstate's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by our Chairman and CEO, Tom Wilson, Chief Financial Officer Steve Shebik and myself, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the first quarter and posted the results presentation we will use this morning in conjunction with our prepared remarks. The documents are all available on our website at allstateinvestors.com. As noted on the first slide, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2015, the slides and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release and in our investor supplement. As always, I'll be available to answer any follow-up questions you have after the call. And now I'll turn it over to Tom Wilson. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, good morning. We appreciate you taking the time to stay current on Allstate's operating results. This quarter shows really why we're in business, which is to protect people when disaster strikes. Overall operating profit is down largely because of two significant hailstorms in Texas in March. At the same time, good progress was made in improving the underlying combined ratio for auto insurance and the homeowners business continued to generate margins that enable us to handle large catastrophe losses like we saw in March and still generate a good return for shareholders. So as you know, severe weather creates a need for our customers to be protected. It's an increasing market these days. And Allstate does an excellent job of helping customers when these events happen. In Texas we have over 1,100 local agencies, many of whom are close to our customers that are impacted by these hailstorms so that they can help provide initial claim response. We also have about 1,200 especially trained catastrophe adjusters on the ground in Texas with the expertise, technology and relationships that enable our customers to rebuild after these storms. If we go to slide two, I'll begin by reviewing the overall results and priorities and then pass to Steve who will discuss the results in greater detail. As always Matt Winter, our President is here as is Don Civgin who leads the emerging businesses and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. Net income for the quarter was $217 million and operating income was $322 million or $0.84 per share. The largest driver of the variance from last year's first quarter was catastrophe losses which increased by $533 million to $827 million. The underlying combined ratio was 87.2 as the auto profitability actions we've put into place for Allstate Esurance and Encompass all made progress in the first quarter from where we ended 2015. Allstate brand homeowners insurance had a recorded combined ratio of 93.4 for the quarter despite the significant catastrophe losses. The recorded combined ratio was 82.3 for the last 12 months. From an investment perspective, we had what felt like a whole year of volatility in the first three months of the year and ended up with a 2% total return on the portfolio reflecting three components : interest income for the fixed income portfolio, good returns from performance-based investments, and the decline in interest rates over the three-month period. Total return over the last 12 months was only 1.3%, which reflected the low returns in the fixed income investments in the last three quarters of 2015 given the general up trend in interest rates. Net investment income declined 14% as a result of our strategy to create additional shareholder value by increasing performance-based investments where risk-adjusted returns are higher but reported accounting income fluctuates in the short-term. Two-thirds of the decline in investment income reflects the performance-based annualized yield of 9.4% in the first quarter of 2016 versus an outstanding 17.5% in the first quarter of 2015. As a result of the underlying strength of Allstate's businesses, the board authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program, which is in addition to the 10% dividend increase that was approved in February. We also made progress on the five operating priorities established for 2016. Customers of course are at the heart of our strategy and better serving them will create additional growth and profit. Our internal measures of overall customer satisfaction did deteriorate slightly as we raised auto insurance prices to reflect the increasing number and cost of auto accidents. That said, we made progress in some of the underlying drivers through expansion of continuous improvement programs and good expense control. Overall, economic returns on capital improved as the auto profitability plan progresses, homeowners stay strong and we position the investment portfolios to align with our liability structure. While not the same as economic capital, the operating return on book equity was 10% for the last 12 months and it was 8% on a net income basis. Growing the number of customer relationships also faces headwinds as we adapt to the increasing cost of providing auto insurance. Property liability items in force were comparable to a year ago but were down from where we ended 2015. We did have great growth through Allstate Benefits' work site business, which added over 0.5 million policies over the last 12 months. Steve will discuss how we proactively manage the investment portfolio, but progress was also made in expanding the telematics insurance offering both in terms of customer offering and the number of customers. At over 1 million active connections, we're amongst the leaders in the connected car space. Let's go to slide three, which provides an overview of the first quarter operating results for our four property-liability customer segments. Starting at the top, overall property-liability policies in force were comparable to a year ago as a result of implementing auto profit improvement plans in all three underwritten brands. Net written premiums still increased, however, as we raised average prices. The recorded combined ratio was 98.4 and the underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 87.2. We have not changed our full-year guidance for the underlying combined ratio from 88 to 90. Moving to the lower left for the Allstate brand, this is our largest segment comprising 90% of premiums written and it serves customers who prefer a branded product and value local advice and assistance. Allstate brand's total policies in force growth slowed in the first quarter to 0.4% as from the prior year's quarter as a result of our targeted actions to improve underlying auto profitability. Auto policies in force grew by 0.5% from the prior-year quarter, impacted by the slowdown in new business and a decline in retention. Auto written premium growth was 4.7% for the quarter, driven by the positive average premium growth of 4.8%, and that's as the impact of the rate increases continues to flow into results. Homeowner policies grew over the prior year by 0.6% and other personal lines grew by 1.8%, both slowing sequentially given the impact that auto actions have had on customers who prefer to bundle their insurance product. The Allstate brand underlying combined ratio was a strong 86.1 for the first quarter, as shown in the highlighted red box at the bottom. Esurance on the lower right serves customers that prefer branded products but are comfortable handling their own insurance needs. A 1% decline in policies in force was more than offset by a 5.2% increase in average auto premium so that the net written premium increased by 2.5%. As you know, we intentionally slowed the growth of Esurance last year to better position this business for long-term growth since it was almost double the size it was when we acquired it in 2011. The underlying loss ratio has come down to 73.1 in the first quarter of 2016, which has improved by 5.1 points compared to the first quarter of 2015. As a result, the underlying combined ratio declined to 105, which includes about 3.4 points of expenses related to a number of expansion efforts. We do expect to launch a new advertising campaign for Esurance this year to accelerate growth. Encompass in the upper left competes for customers that want local advice but are less concerned about the choice of insurance company and they mostly purchase through independent agencies. We took aggressive action to improve profitability in both auto and homeowners insurance in 2015 and consequently policies in force declined by 9.6% from a year ago. The underlying combined ratio was 88.3 for the first quarter, 2.3 points better than the prior year but, as you can see, the recorded combined ratio was 105.8 and that's because Encompass' performance was also significantly impacted by catastrophe losses in the quarter. Answer Financial in the upper right serves brand-neutral customers who are comfortable serving themselves and it increased non-proprietary written premiums by 1.3% in the first quarter of 2016 to $151 million. Pat will now go through the property liability results in more detail. Patrick Macellaro - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Tom. I'll begin with a review of our property-liability results on slide four. Beginning with the chart on the top of this page, property-liability earned premium of $7.7 billion in the first quarter of 2016 was 4% higher than the same period of last year. Recorded combined ratio of 98.4 increased 4.7 points versus the first quarter of 2015, driven by the $827 million catastrophe losses Tom mentioned earlier. While the underlying combined ratio of 87.2 improved by 1.8 points. Net investment income of $302 million for the property-liability segment decreased 15.6% from the prior-year quarter, driven by a decline in performance-based investment income, which had strong results in 2015. As a result, property-liability operating income in the first quarter was $291 million, which was $264 million lower than the first quarter of last year. The chart on the lower left-hand side of this page shows property-liability net written premium and policy in force growth rates. The red line represents policy in force growth versus the prior year and shows that policy growth was comparable to the prior-year quarter given actions in place across all three underwritten brands to improve auto returns. The blue line on this chart shows net written premium grew by 2.9% in the first quarter of 2016 as average premium continued to increase. The bottom right-hand side of this page shows the property-liability recorded and underlying combined ratio results. Let's go first to the red line, which shows the recorded property-liability combined ratio in the first quarter of 2016 was 98.4. This was 4.7 points higher than the first quarter of 2015 result of 93.7 but included 6.7 more points in catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 87.2 showed by the blue bar was 1.8 points below the first quarter of 2015. Slide five provides an update on our comprehensive auto profit improvement plan which is comprised of four parts : first, we're seeking approval for higher auto prices. In the first quarter, we received approval to increase rates by $335 million annually which is on top of the $1.1 billion of increases approved last year, as you can see from the bar chart in the lower left. The impact of these approvals on average premium for Allstate brand auto is shown on the lower right. Average gross premium per policy increased by 4.8% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. Average net earned premium per policy which lags written increased by 3.8%. Keep in mind Allstate brand auto rate changes take six months to be fully recognized in average gross written premium while they take 12 months to fully earn in. Secondly, we tightened underwriting guidelines in 2015 to reduce new business and underperforming segments. As we achieved target underwriting results, these guidelines are being modified. Focus on claims operational excellence and precision is always a priority, but Allstate brand auto property damage severity increased 7.5% in the first quarter of 2016 which is a rate of increase we believe to be higher than what can be explained by inflationary increases. Continued stress on the auto repair industry from higher industry frequency, cost of repairing newer more complex vehicles and a higher total loss volume has caused steadily increasing claim severity. Our team is working to address these industry challenges and create a competitive advantage for Allstate. Property-liability expense ratio decreased by 1.7 points in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 reflecting lower marketing costs and expense reductions. Marketing was purposefully reduced given the rate and underwriting actions we were implementing providing the opportunity to enhance our marketing programs. New campaigns for both Allstate and Esurance will be launched in later this year. Slide six highlights the benefits of these profit improvement actions for Allstate brand auto and the continued strength of Allstate brand homeowners. The chart on the top left of this page provides a view of the quarterly recorded and underlying combined ratios for Allstate brand auto. The underlined combined ratio of 95.9 in the first quarter of 2016 was three-tenths of a point higher than the first quarter a year ago reflecting continued higher levels of accident frequency and higher severity. While property damage frequency in the first three months of 2016 moderated somewhat from prior quarters, still increased on a paid basis by over 2%. As we've discussed, frequency is evaluated on a gross and paid basis for a variety of reasons such as managing claim staffing, evaluating cost trends, and estimating ultimate losses. To provide additional transparency into how these measures relate, we added a footnote to the investors supplement that isolates the impact that including fixed objects hit by a vehicle had on gross frequency which is likely larger than that on a paid frequency basis. These types of changes are accounted for in our processes and had no impact on pricing or our financial results. The chart on the top right highlights the drivers of Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio. Annualized average earned premium per policy shown by the blue line continued to increase as approved rates resulted in a 4.7% increase in premiums written in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter a year ago. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy in the first quarter of 2016 increased 5.1% compared with the first quarter of 2015 due to higher frequency and severity and was partially offset by lower expenses per policy. The positive GAAP between these two trends widened in the first quarter as earned premium growth outpaced the increased loss costs in the quarter. On a sequential basis, the underlying combined ratio improved by 1.7 points compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 due mainly to improved loss ratio. Allstate brands homeowners results are shown on the bottom of this page. On the bottom left you can see the significant impact catastrophes had in the first quarter of 2016 given the gap between the blue column and the red line. On an underlying basis continued favorable non-catastrophe frequency and severity and lower expenses resulted in a 59.4 underlying combined ratio in the quarter which was 5.3 points lower than the prior-year's quarter. The components of the first quarter homeowners underlying combined ratio are in the chart on the bottom right. Average earned premium per policy increased to $1,091 or 2.2% over the prior year quarter while underlying loss and expense per policy decreased by 5.8%. On a sequential basis, the underlying combined ratio rose by 3.4 points from a very favorable 56 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Slide seven provides a view of the financial trends for both Esurance and Encompass. These charts on the top of this page show the component parts of the combined ratios for both brands. Esurance's recorded combined ratio of 106.3 in the first quarter of 2016 was 11.6 points lower than the same period of a year ago reflecting decreased marketing investment, along with 4.4 point improvement in the loss ratio due to ongoing actions to improve auto returns. Encompass' recorded combined ratio of 105.8 in the first quarter of 2016 was adversely affected by catastrophe losses that were 7 points higher than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio on Encompass of 88.3 was 2.3 points lower than the first quarter a year ago, a result of ongoing underwriting and pricing changes to achieve target margins. The charts on the bottom of this page show how growth is being impacted by profit improvement actions in both brands. In Esurance, policies declined by 1% compared to the first quarter of 2015 while net written premium grew by 2.5% compared to the same quarter a year ago and Encompass net written premium declined by 6.7% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 as the 9.6% decline in policies in force more than offset higher average premium from increased rates. Now I'll turn it over to Steve. Steven E. Shebik - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks Pat. Slide eight provides an overview of Allstate Financial's results for the first quarter of 2016. There are three main businesses in Allstate Financial with a total of 6 million policies outstanding. A life insurance business that provides products sold to Allstate agencies, Allstate Benefits which provide life, disability and flex health products at the work site, and an annuity business which is largely closed for new businesses. We began to reposition Allstate Financial in 2006 when we exited the variable annuity business, then accelerate the repositioning post the financial crisis in a low interest rate environment. The bar chart on the upper left shows that there's an impact to the balance sheet over the last four years with total reserves declining by $21 billion due to exiting the broker dealer and bank channels for deferred annuities and the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life. Notice that the grey bar representing immediate annuity reserves has been relatively constant. Although these annuities begin paying out benefits immediately upon issuance, they have extremely long lives. The current financial results are shown in the upper right. Premiums and contract charges increased 5.4% in the quarter versus the prior year driven by 9.6% growth of Allstate Benefits and an increase in traditional life insurance products. Net investment income declined to $419 million or 13.4% as you saw long duration fixed income bonds in the immediate annuity portfolio in the third quarter of 2015. These sales harvested the gain on these bonds given the decline in interest rates. The proceeds will be shifted over time to performance based investments which are expected to generate higher long-term returns. I will discuss this in more detail on the next slide. Operating income was $104 million for the first quarter reflecting the decline in investment income. As you can see from the chart on the bottom, the decline was concentrated in the annuity business. Moving on to slide nine, you can see the shift in investment allocation for the Allstate Financial portfolio. We reduced investment grade fixed income securities shown in blue from 68% to 60%, increased our holdings of investments where asset-specific performance drives more of the return such as limited partnerships and equities. The shift to public equities and performance-based investments is expected to deliver increased long-term returns over time. The chart on the bottom left is based on historical return data from 1800 to 2015. On average, regardless of the time horizon, equities have historically out performed fixed income, as you can see from the grey columns. On the right two columns on the table, the risk, as measured by the 99% loss level for fixed income is lower and up for equities over a one-year time period. By 10 years, the risk of loss is the same but the returns are more than double. Since we can hold the investment back in the immediate annuity reserves for a long period of time, performance-based assets are expected to generate additional shareholder value. However, the challenge from a financial reporting perspective is that these returns fluctuate quarterly impacting reported operating earnings. The chart at the bottom right shows that while our performance-based long-term earned yield and returns fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, the ten year internal rate of return has trended consistently in the range of our long-term return target of above 10% On slide 10, our GAAP total return on investment portfolio shown at the upper left was 2% for the first quarter. The investment income component of return has been fairly consistent and valuations were positive in 2016 as fixed income marks increased on lower interest rates. The unrealized gain on the portfolio increased to about $2 billion as you can see on the upper right. Overall investment income of $731 million was 14% lower than the first quarter of 2015, but two-thirds of this decline reflects a good return from performance-based investments, 9.4% on an annualized basis versus what was a great quarter a year ago. Investment income and yield by business segment are provided at the bottom of the slide. To the left is property-liability. We reduced our interest rate risk in this portfolio in 2013 and yield is now increasing reflecting our increased allocation to high yield bonds and performance-based long-term investments. As I noted earlier, we took actions last year to reduce interest rate risk in the Allstate Financial portfolio and began to increase performance-based investments back in the immediate annuity portfolio. While we realized capital gains, the shorter duration lowered the interest bearing yield to 4.5% as shown by the black line in the chart to the right. We are currently well positioned to shift to performance-based investments as well as to extend the duration of our fixed income portfolio at the appropriate time. Slide 11 provides overview of our capital strength and cash returns for the first quarter of 2016. Allstate remains in a position of financial strength and flexibility. We finished the first quarter of 2016 with $20.3 billion of shareholders' equity and deployable holding company assets of $2.9 billion. During April 2016, we completed the $3 billion share repurchase authorization that was announced last year and, as Tom mentioned, our board of directors authorized a new $1.5 billion program yesterday to be completed no later than November of 2017. Generally, we fund our annual share repurchase activity with net income less any capital we need to retain to grow the business and pay our common dividend. Our repurchase activity has been enhanced over the past few years by a number of proactive capital and risk management actions. For example, the actions we undertook to strengthen the balance sheet by issuing hybrid securities, preferred stock enabled us to return capital in excess of net income over the past three years. The sale of Lincoln Benefit Life in 2014 freed up an additional $1.2 billion of capital which was also used to repurchase common shares. In the last 12 months we repurchased 9% of outstanding shares, increasing pro-rata ownership and earnings per share leverage. Since the beginning of 2010, we repurchased 36% of year-end 2009 outstanding common shares and have paid $2.8 billion in common dividends, representing a total $12.2 billion return of capital to common shareholders. With that, I'll ask Jonathan to open up the line for your questions. Operator : Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, and thank you for hosting the call. I appreciate the chart you had in your presentation about the increase in average premium. In the auto profitability measures slide, in your supplement, the loss ratio looks like it stabilized. Nevertheless, I'm wondering when should we expect that to start improving in the context of your rate actions that you've implemented over the last year. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Greg. It's Tom. As you know, and Pat mentioned it, it takes a while. So when we get a price approved, we obviously have to go through the regulators, and then once we do that, we have to program it in and start to roll it out to our customers, and those policies roll out over six months. And then of course it takes another six months before you collect it all. Matt can talk about the pace of change, but his team has been highly focused on this and aggressive making sure we are ahead of where the industry is going in terms of getting our pricing fixed so that when they catch up with us, we'll have an opportunity to grow again at profitable levels. Matthew E. Winter - President: Greg, it's Matt. Thanks for the question. Everything that Tom just said is true, and that would be true if we were in a completely static environment, but we're not. So we're in a still moving environment. So we did see auto frequency moderate in the first quarter compared to the last half of 2015. And as a result, as you said, because of the rate taken, average earned begun outpacing loss cost trends in the quarter. That's a really good thing. But we are questioning whether some of the moderation of frequency may have been due to weather in the first quarter; we don't know. But we're not sure exactly whether or not we've seen the rise \u2013 the end of the rise in auto frequency, a stabilization or just normal fluctuation. So from that perspective, we continue to execute on our profit improvement plan, and we refine that profit improvement plan as time goes on and we get more information, greater clarity on the trend line, and that's true not only on frequency but it's true on severity as well. And as you've seen, I'm sure you've looked at fourth quarter Fast Track, it showed a clear acceleration across the industry in PD and collision severity. That's due to total loss is up, higher cost to repair more complex cars, greater number of parts replaced, a whole host of different factors. Allstate has historically outperformed the industry in managing those costs. It looks like in first quarter we may have given up some of that advantage due to responding to the high catastrophe load and increased frequency, but our goal is to get back to our competitive position there and lead the industry. But the end result of all of that is that we'll continue to execute all four components of the profit improvement plan. We'll continue to monitor the emergence of both frequency and severity trends, and we'll ensure that we are keeping pace with loss cost trends because we know that once you fall behind those trends, it's really hard, due to the timing Tom referred to, to really ever catch up quickly. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Greg, sometimes people are trying to forecast the combined ratio by quarter. You can do that. Obviously, what Matt just said is what he's been executing on which is we've made \u2013 we're getting good returns in the auto business today, but we've gotten much more attractive returns given our competitive position, and we're headed to do that. You could do the math, you could look at that bottom left-hand chart, you could look at the $1.1 billion or the $300 million, you can forecast about what time you think it will come in. You can \u2013 it's not complete dollar for dollar, but we have pretty high effectiveness on getting that through. And then you could look at just what happened to frequency and severity. So what Matt is saying is we're just at this, we know we need to make more money in auto insurance. We've made great progress, but we're not done yet. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Excellent color. Thank you. Just one follow-up. How should we think about the expense ratio over the next several quarters in the context of, I guess, you've announced a new advertising campaign, and it's clear that you've booked substantial improvement in the expense ratio over the last three quarters? Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, well, we have. Obviously, we're always trying to make sure we watch expenses, whether that be our marketing expenses, our technology expenses or our general overhead expenses. And our team has a lot of work going on on that third category. In marketing, you're right, it did come down. We took the opportunity. There's really no reason to continue to bang away and drop lots of money on advertising if your underwriting standards are tight and you don't really want to grow. Despite the fact that more people are shopping, one of the reasons we try to get out ahead of it is with our brand and our marketing we want to be open for business when other people are raising their rates so we pick up those shoppers. And so I think you should expect to see our expense ratio go up, but we're going to manage it to make sure that we still get the combined ratio target we're trying to get to. We did take this opportunity to refresh some of our programs and we feel good about what we're going to launch. But it's not like we went dark either. We advertise all the time. We look for folks. We have stuff going on. So it's not like we shut the place down, we just toggled it back a little bit. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you, and congratulations on the quarter. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your question, please. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. Good morning. Just a question I guess on the capital management. $1.5 billion buyback, it sounds like over the next five or six quarters with the common dividend it doesn't seem like it would quite add up to sort of what the street is thinking of for overall operating earnings. Just curious if we're at a point now where you think about needing to retain some capital to grow whether it's through M&A or just organic growth? I know in the 10-K you mentioned your strategic priority is now to build and acquire long-term growth platforms, not just to build. So I'm just curious if there is any M&A component to that. Thanks. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Ryan, this is Tom. We have plenty of financial fire power to do whatever we need to do. Steve mentioned our debt to capital ratio is lowest it's been, I think, since I've been here and I've been here over 20 years. And we're in really strong position if we need to do anything. Steve mentioned that the thing that we had done historically, so last $3 billion program, had over $1 billion in it from Lincoln Benefit Life. So I think what happens is sometimes the confusion is people get the capital actions in the divestitures mixed up with how much we need to grow in that. And so we think this is the right amount of money, it keeps the company really strong. We have plenty of capacity to either grow our business, handle any kind of large catastrophes that might come our way or see if we find something that's attractive to us externally, we would want to add to the portfolio, we can do that. And Steve can \u2013 I mean, Steve went through the variance. Was there anything else on the variance of how we got to $1.5 billion that you want to hear more about or are you okay with that? Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): No, that sounds like it's just largely attributed to the deployment of excess, so that's fair. And I guess my follow up is just Esurance and how we should think about the road to profitability from here. Because for a while, it seemed like the story there was scale the top line and also improve the loss ratio. The loss ratio actually looks pretty good now, down near 73, but it doesn't look like it's growing and we're at like 105 combined. So just I guess what's the path to a sub 100 combined ratio on Esurance? Thanks. Don Civgin - President-Emerging Businesses, Allstate Insurance Co.: Ryan, it's Don Civgin. Let me give you an overview on that. First, if you recall, we acquired Esurance for strategic reasons so that we could grow in the segment where customers wanted self-service and a branded experience. We have from the very beginning been running Esurance from an economic value basis as opposed to GAAP. So with the difference in accounting between the advertising being expensed in the quarter you spend it, if you run it for GAAP combined ratio, it is hard to drive it. So we've been looking at economic value. The business is twice the size it was roughly when we bought it. The GAAP numbers do matter because it's growing to be an increasing size of the Allstate portfolio. So they have spent the last roughly two years working to improve the performance of the business on a profitability basis. They've improved the loss ratio, but they've also had some operational catch up because while it's a direct business, it isn't all done online. We still have claims adjusters, we still have customers to take care of, we still have call centers. I'm really happy with the progress they've made. The combined ratio is in much better shape than it was a year ago. The number you're looking at, the underlying of 105, includes, as Tom mentioned, 3.4 points of investment in product expansion and geographic expansion that's not currently paying off in the current period. Underneath that, the loss ratio improved by over 4 points over last year. So very happy with where it is. You're right it's still over a hundred, but out of that 105, I think you have to look and take that investment of 3.4 points out. And then there's still some room on the expenses for them to bring both advertising and non-advertising expenses down. So I feel good about where they are. As far as the growth, yeah, they didn't grow this year, but in the first quarter, but they also spent 36% less on marketing. That's not a direct correlation, but they are running a better more effective business. And as Tom said, we're feeling good about where it is, and it is still our growth vehicle in that segment, but we needed to get some operational things sorted out first. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks so much for the answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, good morning, everyone. Two questions. One is can we talk a little about your rate need in auto going forward and maybe touch on rate need in Texas homeowners on top of that? And my second question relates to mass hitting about two or three quarters ago, but we're getting well ahead of it. There's always this fourth quarter seasonality in losses that didn't happen at all last 4Q as we start discounting the end of the year into our thoughts, was that seasonality just a coincidence? Matthew E. Winter - President: Josh, it's Matt. I'll start with the first question about rate in auto going forward. You know that we don't disclose our rate plan for the year. We do disclose the fact that we have every intention of staying ahead of our loss cost trends, and as we monitor those, we continue to take rate as necessary. We have robust rate plans. We revise and amend and change them on an almost ongoing basis as we watch the emergence of loss costs. The only thing I can tell you is that there is some public information about rates that has already been filed and approved so far this quarter. You're free to go and search out publicly available information, but I can't give you anything beyond that. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And can we talk about Texas onto that specifically, whether a cat in Texas is a rate issue or whether it's just a volatility issue? Matthew E. Winter - President: Well, I'll answer it this way : as we look, we always have a cat load that we take into account as we're looking at rate need overall. We have to figure out what is normal volatility and normal catastrophe activity and when we're at a new norm and whether weather patterns are changing and non-modeled cats are increasing due to global warming, we will and are continuing to look at that. And if we determine that this is a new norm, we will price appropriately for it. But that's a tough question, and I don't think that we will change something based upon a set of cats that took place over a ten-day period. So it will take more than that. But it's a good point that we have to look at whether or not we're in a new weather environment and a new cat environment, and if so, how we react. I guarantee we will react to ensure that we earn economic risk-adjusted returns in Texas and every other state where we have cat exposure. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. And seasonality of the loss ratio. Anything behind that or is that just a magical thing? Matthew E. Winter - President: Boy, everybody has a theory on this one. I personally will tell you that we don't believe that there's any historical trend in seasonality that holds true all the time. There's generalities, but last quarter was one of the warmest first quarters in the last 20 years. Things change, and who knows what's going to happen in fourth quarter in terms of weather, in terms of catastrophes. And so I don't put that much credence into kind of seasonality predictions. I think they're informative, they help us plan for things, but there have been more exceptions to the rules lately than the rules. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Let me add one. So as Matt pointed out, he looks at \u2013 and our team really focuses on homeowners by state, or by in total, which you saw the numbers in total, by state and by territory, right. So it's broken down. What I would say is that severe losses like hail, straight-line winds, or tornados do come through the pricing models faster than severe losses that are caused by hurricanes or earthquakes because of the longer term nature of the actuarial science on that. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's a good answer. Thank you, Tom. And thank you, both and good luck in the rest of the year. Matthew E. Winter - President: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Your question, please. Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. So I wanted to start with a kind of a numbers question, in a sense I want to make sure I understand. So you said this quarter the weather appeared to be light in auto and home and that's probably driving the frequency benefit. And so the headwind there would be \u2013 in the future may be loss ratios would sort of bounce back, but the upside from an investor perspective is that you're not going to slow raising price increases because you're not ready to declare victory on frequency yet. So that's my first actuarial question. And my second related point, I'm just looking at your BI severity which has been negative for a couple of quarters and I'm trying to understand what's driving that, whether it's the claims initiatives that you've been working through or if that's more environmental? And I'm trying to get to do we actually think \u2013 do we think that those favorable trends persist and ultimately if the underlying sort of net trend for auto maybe is going to be challenging from here? Thank you. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Josh, so Matt will answer your question, but just to be clear, we didn't say that favorable weather impacted first quarter results. Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Excuse me. Thank you for correcting. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I just wanted to be clear. It just is what it is. Matthew E. Winter - President: Yeah, Josh, it's Matt. I think your question is really about \u2013 I think you referred to it as actuarial, but I think you were referring to whether or not if we have some uncertainty about some of the causal factors in gross frequency, whether that impacts our ability to price and take rate. Rate indications are at a paid, not at a gross and they're based upon your net trends and your indication, and we go to the regulators and the insurance departments with a robust actuarial package that shows net trends current indications. And so most of that, quote, uncertainty about telling you what we think weather did to gross frequency trends last quarter is irrelevant to the pricing packages that we've put together which are based upon much more precise information. As far as the BI severity and why it's down, yes, you are correct, we have talked to you about our enhanced medical injury handling program. Part of that is an attempt to get through BI cases quickly, especially those that have enhanced injuries. And so a lot of the decrease in BI severity that you saw this last quarter was a mix issue because we're paying a lot more current claims. The more current claims tend to be lower severity claims. That's one of the reasons you see BI frequency up a little this quarter because we handled a bunch more claims, and we went through them. And so you always have that volatility in results in long-tail coverages, and there's a lot of complexity in BI. So it's hard to look at BI paid severity on a quarter-by-quarter basis and make any sense out of it. You have to look at it on the longer term basis, and you have to look at it in conjunction with the frequency to see how much of that volatility is influenced by mix. And in this last quarter, we think a fair amount was influenced by mix. That being said, we think we're making good progress in managing BI severity appropriately. Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: So that's really helpful color. I guess, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I'm trying to sort of synthesize what the net take away would be from all this. Which is I think you're probably going to continue raising prices at more or less the rates you've been because you're going to look through the severity thing as sort of mix driven and at the same time the frequency you're going to rely on the paid data more than the gross? Matthew E. Winter - President: Well, that must be a Josh question because both Joshes have tried to get me to predict my rate taking activity, which I can't do. Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Well, I thought I'd call it actuarial. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think to be fair we'll go through a period where we'll have to continue to raise prices. Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. I can ask an easy one, then. So I've been happy to see PIF growth has not gone negative in spite of the rate initiatives on the core auto business. Is anything in particular you guys are doing to offset that? Or is this just more a function of the fact you've got such sticky customer relationships that you have an inelastic book? Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I would point out actually our items in force were down this quarter from where we ended the year. So when you look at it sequentially, you really have to \u2013 we're down. We expect it to be down some. We're growing in other parts of the company. But this does have an impact on growth. We knew it was going to happen. We managed through it. We spend a bunch of time talking to our customers about policy changes and price increases. And so when you're doing that, you're not out trying to find new customers. So we're just working our way through it. Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your question, please. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. On the Allstate brand homeowners business, the first quarter ex-cat combined ratio was slightly under 60%. That's a pretty big improvement year-over-year but was actually up relative to the fourth quarter. I'm trying to get a sense of whether you feel you can keep it at or below that 60% range. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : When we started this, really \u2013 and you'll remember, Jay, I don't remember how many \u2013 maybe five, six years ago, we said we felt that the business needed to, with catastrophes over time, run in the low 80s% and then you can put in whatever kind of cat load you want. We're running there today. We're comfortable with it. The underlying bounces around a lot quarter-to-quarter. We didn't note in the fourth quarter that we thought that was a pretty low level at 56% and change because cat loads are typically not that high so that you need to be below 60%. So we're just trying to make sure we're competitive in the marketplace, give our customers a good return, handle the volatility. But because we handle that volatility, our shareholders get a good return, which based on the required capital levels we had initially meant in the lower part of the 80s%. That said, because we've improved the profitability, we now need to keep less capital, and so we manage it, as Matt said, we manage the stuff dynamically on \u2013 we're always looking at what's the right return on capital by state, by territory, and we adjust for it. So I think you should expect us to continue to deliver good risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders given that we're willing to take on the volatility of quarters like this quarter. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's great. And then when I think about scenarios like we have with the Texas floods, I'm sure if it's disclosable we'll hear about it in a couple of weeks, but in that type of scenario, is there homeowners risk of loss there during a flood, or is that really just more focused on auto comprehensive? Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I mean, obviously there's a risk of loss because homeowners will lose stuff when the house floods. The federal government sells flood insurance, we do not. Are there things that could go along with that? Cars get flooded out, stuff like that, sure. But we factor all of that into our pricing. So the Texas floods largely would not be one of the big elements we'd be responsible for. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's what I thought. And then finally on the buyback, the $450 million that was done the first quarter, I'm just trying to square your comments around that. With regard to the new authorization, which my sense is typically it gets done earlier than is outlined, but the $450 million, should we view that as kind of a normalized quarterly run rate or is there perhaps some upside to that in terms of size? Steven E. Shebik - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So this is Steve. The $450 million is probably a little higher than what we're going to have as we go forward. That was based on the prior program. I think I've said before what we do is we actually have outside parties perform the share buyback for us on the basis of a grid. And if you remember, earlier in the quarter, we were lower \u2013 our stock prices went down a little bit, so we were at a lower part of that grid and we didn't buy back as much stock. I'm sorry, we bought back more stock because our price was down a little bit, which caused us to do the $450 million versus a somewhat lower number, which is why we ended the program in April versus a couple months later. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. Steven E. Shebik - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Your question, please. Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Thanks. And good morning, and congrats on the quarter. Two quick follow-up questions, if I may. The first I guess goes back to what Greg was asking about the loss cost trends. On the last call, you had talked about competitors and spent more time on the industry. Recently one of the larger companies had adverse development in their results. Does that sort of news \u2013 did that lead you to maybe take a pause or sort of recalibrate the growth plans for 2016? Or do you just feel that, okay, this is others addressing the issues that we have addressed in the past? Matthew E. Winter - President: Amit, it's Matt. It's an interesting question. But let me be clear that we have an Allstate philosophy for both how we reserve, which is very conservatively. Somebody else's prior-year development is really not that instructive for us. It's interesting, we look at it. It always provides context and information, but we have fairly precise ways that we approach this and that we ensure that we're reserved appropriately. And as I said when I answered Greg's, I think our level of detailed study as we determine where to take rate, how much rate to take, what the net trends are, what the indications are, number one, the level of thoroughness has shown up in our effectiveness in getting rate approved in each of the states. But two, it allows us to react to our information as opposed to others. Everybody is in a different place. Everybody is in a different place in terms of what the rate is, where their rate is, how much rate they need to take to respond to current trends. We saw at the beginning of last year very few people talking about any frequency or severity issues. And then later on, everybody talking about it. So everybody's timing appears to be different, and we're focused on our own book of business, our own trends and our own math. Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Fair enough. The only other question I had was going back to the discussion on expenses and the marketing campaign, did I understand this correctly? Is it just going back to the usual normalized level, or is this sort of a reboot for Allstate and Esurance brands? Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : What we were indicating is we're going to put some new creative out with some \u2013 that is incorporated into a marketing program which is, you know, becoming more and more heavily digital as opposed to mass media. And so we're constantly adjusting that one as well. We don't have an established percentage of premiums that we say this is what we want to spend. We do it the way it was done and Matt had mentioned. Like, if we think we can write the business economically and it creates shareholder value then we look at the cost per acquisition, and we go out and do it, and we look at that with great precision, whether that comes through online stuff or whether it's through TV ads or radio ads. So what we're just trying to say is as it relates to expenses, the marketing expenses are down. They were down intentionally because we didn't really want to grow. And so now as we're coming through the profit improvement plan on auto, we will want to go back to growing. It will take us some time to get there. So this is not going to happen in every state, in every market, in every medium or every brand at the same pace. So I think you should expect to see our expense ratio increase a little bit as we go forward. But I don't think you should see it be a dramatic spike. Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Got it. Fair enough. Thanks for the answers, and good luck for the future. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Your question, please. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Good morning, Allstate. I really appreciate the disclosure in the bottom of slide eight on Allstate Life decomposition of earnings. And hopefully we will get that prospectively and retroactively would be even better. As we think about the Allstate Life ROE progression, Matt, when you took over several years ago, the idea was to go into mortality, morbidity, and cut back spread products, and that's played out well. And the hope was even though you had some legacy drains in the annuity block that will run off over time, the higher profit ROE will take charge to drive it forward. Now you've had lower yields and some pressures, but where are we, Tom, on the ROE progression there? Can you take capital out of there going forward to help as well? Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That's a good question, Bob. So as you point out, we've been working on improving the returns in that business for some time. We feel like we've been making good progress. But the other thing I would say is we look at ROE, but we really manage for shareholder value. So the items when you look at that lower right-hand side and see what happened to annuities in terms of operating income, that hurt the current ROE. But we're okay with that. It hurt it for two reasons. One is obviously we harvested, I think, it was over $0.25 billion of gains and basically front-end loaded, what would have come through as operating income into book value when we sold the bonds, and now we're going to put it in longer term investments that obviously takes a while to get invested. So you earn \u2013 as Steve pointed out, we'd like try to get about 10% on that stuff. It takes a while to get that investment in and to actually get to 10% because it doesn't happen on day one. Secondly, it also makes us put up more capital because under the regulatory schemes, when you're investing your performance based investments, you put out more capital than you would put out some fixed income. We believe that's a good trade and in our shareholders' best interest. So we're willing to take an ROE hit if we believe that it generates long-term shareholder value, which in the end turns out to be total return-based for that immediate annuity portfolio. So we continue to work hard on. We've been taking capital out of Allstate Financial for, I don't know, Steve... Steven E. Shebik - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Three years... Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Three years or something. So to the extent we can do that, to the extent we can use financing techniques in a variety of ways to do it, we continue to work on how do we raise the return on capital particularly as it relates to those annuity businesses. That said, we haven't come up with any what I would call synthetic approaches to do it. It's just been we've got to work the money hard. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Thank you. My follow up is a detour to commercial auto. You had a mild increase in reserves in the quarter. Where are you in that book pricing-wise and what drove the reserve increase? Matthew E. Winter - President: Hi, Bob. It's Matt. Yes, thanks for noticing. Yeah, we did have some reserve strengthening. The vast majority of it was in commercial auto and then a little bit in prop. And it's the same drivers that existed on all the other underwritten standard auto brands, it was frequency, severity trends and unfortunately I don't think we were at the proper rate level when those hit, and so catching up takes a little longer. And we have to be more dramatic, and you have seen that and you will continue to see that. So we're going to move aggressively to get that business to the point where it's really serving what I think could be a really unique strategic purpose. In addition to bringing in appropriate risk adjusted returns. This is a great marketplace for Allstate. The small business \u2013 we were Main Street, USA. We have a lot of our existing standard auto and homeowner customers' own small businesses. We have natural connections and a natural brand affinity, and my goal and our goal, the team's goal, is to get the profitability at an appropriate level, get the returns where they should be and then deploy this as a strategic asset as part of our broader trusted advisor strategy to serve the full range of customers with their full range of needs. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : We've seen the commercial auto movie before in the industry over the last several quarters. So the reserve increases have tended not to be cameo appearances, but I got every confidence that you'll get your arms around it. Patrick Macellaro - Vice President- Investor Relations : Hey, Matt. We'll take one more question, please. Operator : Certainly. Patrick Macellaro - Vice President- Investor Relations : Jonathan, sorry. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you so much for fitting me in. And first question is on the guidance. It looks like the first quarter 87 is below the 88 to 90 full year guidance? And it looks like the auto book will continue to improve over the coming quarters. So what is holding you back? Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It's a 12-month forecast and we're 3 months in. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So I just wonder is there any seasonality or maybe the property book is better than what you anticipated? Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. We've just always said it's a 12-month forecast. We don't hold ourselves accountable for it. You'll remember last year we were bumping along towards the top end of the range. When we get to the third quarter, we thought we might actually end up outside the range so we let everybody know that, and we had a great fourth quarter and came in below the range. So it bounced around. We see no need to update our outlook there. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. Then the bigger picture question, you have million cars connected through telematics and we have seen seemingly quicken pace in terms of technology advancements such as active safety as well as autonomous driving as well as the driving behavior like shared mobility. For all the auto industry, they tend to be backward looking using sort of actuarial table to determine rates and products. I just wonder how do you actively anticipate this technology changes that position your products and market position. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, as you point out, we now have I think it's 1,050,000 or so people currently connected to us on a daily basis. We pull different kinds of information from them. That enable us to do a couple things. You're absolutely right it enables us to price more accurately because when we are determining what we should charge somebody, we have to put them into groups and actuarially sort that out. In this case, we can basically put them into different groups because we know how you brake, what time you drive, there's a variety of things that enable us to give customers more accurate price and oftentimes that's a lower price more attractive price for them. With that, we can also provide them that connectivity in the one hour a day they spend in their car is where we can add additional value for them. For example, today we have the safer you drive, the more rewards you get. If you can get safe drive rewards, it gives you discounts on things. Our customers like that. It improves our value proposition form. And so that will develop over time. We have a slightly different model than some of the other people in the business who are doing it mostly for the more accurate pricing. So they can do a one-time shot of people and get a sense that ours is a different model. I'm not declaring ours is the right one. I'm just telling we're taking a slightly longer term customer value look at that. We still have a lot of work to do to develop that to build those relationships and figure out how to interact with our customers. So this will be a lot of work for us that has the potential to generate additional value for our shareholders, but we're investing heavily in doing that. Thomas Joseph Wilson - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. First, this is maybe a summary here. This is a kind of quarter that our business is built for. We had to protect people from uncertain things like hail storms that happen to them. At the same time, our shareholders can handle the quarterly earnings volatility, and as a result of that, get attractive returns. Secondly, we know how to run a property casualty business, and that shows up in the way we executed this year. Our investment portfolio is thought about on a risk adjusted return basis, so we're trying to be thoughtful on both a short-term and long-term basis and again factoring in how we want to drive long-term value creation. And then the weather has gotten more volatile, which obviously is a growth opportunity for us because if some people have more disasters, they need more coverage, and we need to get back to growth in our auto and other businesses. But we're having good growth particularly in our benefits business this quarter. So thank you for taking the time, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good bye.",

Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Ryan Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Amit Kumar - Macquarie Capital, Inc. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Sarah DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Allstate second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Pat Macellaro. Please go ahead. Pat Macellaro : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for Allstate\u2019s second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by our Chairman and CEO, Tom Wilson; Chief Financial Officer Steve Shebik, and myself, we\u2019ll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the second quarter, and posted the results presentation we\u2019ll use this morning along with an update to our 2016 countrywide reinsurance program to reflect the replacement of our Florida program. These documents are all available on our website at allstateinvestors.com. As noted on the first slide, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate\u2019s operations. Allstate\u2019s results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2015, the slides, and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in our news release and our investor supplement. As many of you know, this will be my final earnings call as the leader of our Investor Relations team as I transition to leading our Encompass team. I\u2019m leaving Investor Relations in the capable hands of John Griek, who will be a great partner for all of you going forward. John and other members of our senior leadership team will be able to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Thomas. Tom Wilson : Good morning. Thank you for investing your time to keep up with Allstate. I\u2019ll provide an overview of results, and then you\u2019ll hear from Pat and Steve. We also have Matt Winter, our President, here with us; Don Civgin, the President of Emerging Businesses; Mary Jane Fortin, who is President of Allstate Life & Retirement; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. Let\u2019s begin on slide two. The second quarter results highlight really how our proactive approach to external conditions helps us achieve our objectives and create long-term shareholder value. We earned $242 million despite seasonally high second quarter catastrophe losses, a record hail storm in Texas, continued increases in the frequency of auto accidents, and the impact of Brexit on the investment markets. And while we did not predict all of these would happen, we considered the possibilities when we executed our business plan. Operating income was $0.62 per share for the quarter, reflecting a reported combined ratio of 100.8% and an underlying combined ratio of 88.6% for the quarter and 87.9% for the first six months, which is in comparison to our full-year forecast of 88% to 90%. Allstate\u2019s financial strategic repositioning is working, with operating income up slightly to $120 million. Investment returns were strong at 1.9% for the quarter, about half of which is from current income and the other half is from appreciation of the bond portfolio. Let\u2019s go to slide three, which provides an overview of the second quarter operating results for our core property/liability customer segments. As you know, we have a consumer-focused strategy and have over 40 million policies outstanding, of which 34 million are for property and liability protection. The results of each of the four segments of the property/liability market are shown in the diagram on the bottom of the page. Allstate\u2019s agencies provide local advice on a broad range of branded products. It represents about 90% of total property/liability premiums. Total Allstate brand policies in force declined from the second quarter of last year by 1%, as we intentionally reduced new business levels until we improve returns on capital for auto insurance and the impact of these programs on customer retention. While auto policies declined, net written premium increased by 3.9%, which has essentially offset the impact of continued increases in frequency and severity. The recorded combined ratio was 101.2%. The recorded combined ratio for homeowners was 97%, despite $645 million of catastrophe losses in the quarter. The underlying combined ratio was 87.5% for the Allstate branded business for the quarter. Moving across to the lower right is that Esurance policies in force declined as we reduced new auto business in this segment, but net written premium increased by 5.7% over the prior-year quarter. The recorded and underlying combined ratios were 108.9% and 104.8%, which were 1.3 and 1.9 points better than last year\u2019s second quarter results. The underlying loss ratio was consistent with the prior-year quarter. In the upper right is Answer Financial. That\u2019s our self-serve aggregator that sells products for more than 20 different companies. Premiums grew by 3.4% in the second quarter, lower than the prior years, which reflects fewer leads from Esurance as we reduced growth at Esurance. Independent agencies serve customers who want local advice but do not have a high affinity for branded products. Encompass in the upper left serves this segment and has taken significant actions that have reduced the size of the business while simultaneously improving returns. Policies in force were down 11.4%. You can see that in the red box there at the top. Net written premiums declined by 6.8%, as higher prices partially offset the decline in policies. The recorded and underlying combined ratios both improved in the quarter from the prior-year quarter. As you know, we establish and communicate our operating priorities each year, and they range from doing a better job for customers to driving long-term growth, which are shown on slide four. The first three priorities are all interrelated. We\u2019re of course always working to provide customers even better value and service. This ranges from the rapid response catastrophe that we\u2019ve become known for as well as our agency owners being trusted advisors in helping customers prepare and protect themselves from life\u2019s uncertainties. We\u2019ve had over 215,000 catastrophe claims through the end of June and have closed approximately 95% of those. We\u2019re continually focused on improving service from Allstate agencies and have made great progress in initiating relationships with customers. Achieving target returns on capital, however, has required us to raise prices on auto insurance, given the greater frequency of accidents and increased severity of claim costs. So we responded with a comprehensive profit improvement program, which prioritizes existing customers ahead of new customers, leading to a significant reduction in new business volumes. It has also had a negative impact on customer retention levels. This has resulted in a 1.4% decline in the number of property/liability policies in force. Allstate Benefits, on the other hand, added almost 0.5 million new customers over last year, offsetting the property/liability decline, but all of our businesses have the potential for growth over the long term. As you know well, the investment markets this year have been highly volatile, from the early decline in energy prices to a rebound and then down again and Brexit. We have record low interest rates and global equity markets that have been moving up, down, and sideways. Our investment strategy and execution have served us well in this environment, with a total return of 3.9% for the first six months of the year. We continue to build out our performance-based asset team and made progress in increasing the amount of these assets back in the $12 billion payout annuity block. As we discussed on last quarter\u2019s call, this is economically the right risk and return tradeoff for shareholders given the long duration of these liabilities. We\u2019ve also made progress on building long-term growth platforms in a number of areas, from Allstate Benefits to roadside services to telematics. For the second quarter, we want to highlight where we stand on telematics, which is shown on slide five. Allstate began investing in the telematics space over six years ago as a way to improve our business model by serving customers in new and different ways, and we\u2019ve made a tremendous amount of progress over this time period. First, telematics is a very powerful pricing tool that enables us to give customers the most accurate price. Secondly, we\u2019ve found ways to use a continuous connection to broadly evaluate [ph] gifts (8:58) from Allstate and provide additional services to them. For example, we provide customers with tips on how to better protect themselves by changing their driving habits. We\u2019ve also expanded the value they get from being with Allstate such as merchandise discounts based on how safe they drive. The Safe Driver Awards are very popular and expand that customer value proposition. We\u2019ve built up a wide range of capabilities and made significant investments, and today we have over 1 million connected customers. We\u2019ve also concluded that this could be a strategic platform for Allstate, the concepts of which are laid out in the annual report to the shareholders. As a result, we established a connected car entity, Arity, outside of the insurance company, which you can see on the graphic on the lower left of this slide. This provides us with the strategic and operating flexibility to capture additional value from our growing connected customer base by providing other companies the ability to offer services to our customers. It also enables other companies to connect with their customers by using this platform and Arity\u2019s capabilities. We believe that the transformation of the personal transportation system will be one of the largest economic benefits for individual households in the future, and this structure enables us to participate in that value creation. Now let me turn it over to Pat. Pat Macellaro : Thanks, Tom. I\u2019ll start by reviewing the property/liability P&L at the top of slide six. Property/liability earned premium of $7.8 billion in the second quarter of 2016 was 3.5% higher than the same period last year. Through the first six months of 2016, earned premium grew by 3.8%. Catastrophe losses through the first six months of 2016 meaningfully impacted underwriting income. Second quarter catastrophe losses of $961 million were 20.6% higher than the prior-year quarter, while catastrophe losses of $1.8 billion for the first half of 2016 were almost $700 million higher than the first six months of last year. These higher catastrophe losses drove recorded combined ratios of 100.8% in the second quarter of 2016 and 99.6% for first half of 2016. When we exclude catastrophes and prior-year reserve re-estimates, the underlying combined ratio of 88.6% in the second quarter and 87.9% in the first six months of 2016 were both below their respective levels in 2015. The June year-to-date result is slightly below our annual outlook range of 88% to 90%. Property/liability net investment income increased 8.2% to $316 million for the second quarter of 2016, driven primarily by higher performance-based investment income. As a result, property/liability operating income of $186 million in the second quarter of 2016 was 6.1% below the prior-year result, while the $477 million of operating income through the first six months of 2016 was 36.7% below the first six months of 2015. The bottom of this slide contains growth trend information as well as a view of property/liability recorded and underlying combined ratio trends. On the chart on the bottom left, the blue line represents net written premium growth, while the red line shows our policy in force trend. Property/liability policies in force declined by 1.4% or 471,000 in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, while net written premium increased by 2.2% in the same time period. These trends have been heavily influenced by our auto profit improvement actions across underwriting brands. The widening gap between these two trends reflects increases in average premium per policy given ongoing rate increases. The exhibit on the bottom right shows the property/liability recorded and underlying combined ratio along with some history. As you can see on the red line, recorded results in the first two quarters of 2016 have been impacted by a higher level of catastrophe losses. Taking a longer period of time into account, the recorded combined ratio on a 12-month moving basis is 96.2%. Slide seven provides a more detailed view of our Allstate brand auto margin results. The chart on the top left of this page provides a view of the quarterly recorded and underlying combined ratios for Allstate brand auto. The underlying combined ratio of 97.8% in the second quarter of 2016 was unchanged compared to the second quarter of 2015. A lower expense ratio offset an increase in the underlying loss ratio in the quarter. Our early recognition of increased frequency and severity along with the aggressive actions we continue to take have enabled us to keep auto margins stable despite the continued challenging auto loss cost environment. The chart on the top right highlights the drivers of the Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio. Annualized average earned premium per policy, shown by the blue line, continued to increase, as approved rates have resulted in a 5.9% increase in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter a year ago. Average underlying losses and expenses per policy in the second quarter of 2016 increased 5.8% compared with the second quarter of 2015. The positive gap between these two trends narrowed in the second quarter based on ongoing higher frequency, but was consistent with the level we saw during the second quarter of 2015. The bottom two charts on this page provide 20 years of history for Allstate brand auto gross and paid property damage frequency. As we\u2019ve discussed in prior quarters, we evaluate frequency on a gross and paid basis for a variety of reasons, such as managing claim staffing, evaluating cost trends, and estimating our ultimate losses. We watch both metrics to ensure we can evaluate and react to changes in our results as quickly is as possible. Gross frequency is a lead indicator of future loss trends, while paid frequency helps us understand changes in the proportion of claims we close with a payment. The relationship between these two measures will fluctuate over time, given environmental impacts and claim department process changes. As you can see in the charts on this page, both measures are up substantially from where they had been performing in recent history. For the first 12 of the past 20 years, you can see a fairly steady decline in frequency as the safety of cars was enhanced. As the impacts from safety improvements fully worked their way into the fleet, we saw flattening trend for approximately five years. Now the results we\u2019ve seen in the past 18 months have taken us back to levels not experienced since 2003 for gross frequency and 2004 and 2010 for paid frequency. This most recent period reflects just how challenging an auto loss cost environment we continue to operate in. We first identified the uptick in gross frequency during the fourth quarter of 2014, and our analysis indicated it was being driven mainly by environmental factors unrelated to our pricing and underwriting. We continue to believe that our early identification of the issue along with our proactive and aggressive response will position us well to accelerate profitable growth as loss trends stabilize. We continue to implement our profit improvement plan, which is summarized on slide eight. Given ongoing auto loss pressure, we continue to seek approval for higher auto prices. In the second quarter, we received approval to increase rates by $628 million annually, bringing the total for the first six months of 2016 to $963 million, as you can see from the bar chart on the lower left. Rate increases in the second quarter of 2016 were approved in 35 states and Canadian provinces, and were on average 6.2%. The amount of rates approved for the second quarter of 2016 includes a significant amount of rate increases in large states, which drove the total to be much higher than our previous run rate. The impact of these rate approvals on average premium for Allstate brand auto is shown in the lower right. Average gross written premium per policy increased by 5.7% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. Average net earned premium per policy, which lags written, increased by 4.7%. Allstate brand auto rate changes take six months to be fully recognized in average gross written premium, while they take at least 12 months to be fully earned into the P&L. The significant amount of premium we\u2019ve generated by seeking approval for auto price increases has served us well so far. So if we had not moved early, our auto returns would be significantly lower and we\u2019d be playing catch-up until well after the loss pressure we and others are experiencing subsides. We tightened underwriting guidelines in 2015 to reduce new business in underperforming segments and reduced the new business penalty. These guidelines are being modified for specific segments of business within each state and local market where we feel comfortable that we\u2019ve achieved rate adequacy. Our claims team continues to address physical damage severity trends, which are being unfavorably impacted by stress to the auto repair industry from rising industry auto frequency, higher costs associated with repairing newer, more sophisticated vehicles, and greater total loss volume on older model year cars. Property damage paid severity in the second quarter of 2016 remained elevated at 5.3%, but the trend improved relative to the first quarter of this year. Property/liability expense ratio decreased by 0.8 point in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, primarily reflecting reductions in professional services and advertising costs as well as lower accruals for compensation incentives. We continue to evaluate investments in growth and would expect to accelerate these investment as loss trends stabilize. Allstate brand homeowners results are shown on slide nine. On the chart on the left, you can see the impact catastrophes have had in the first two quarters of 2016, given the gap between the blue columns and the red line. The recorded combined ratio on a 12-month moving basis was 83.5% as of the second quarter of 2016. On an underlying basis, continued favorable non-catastrophe losses and lower expenses resulted in a 58.6% underlying combined ratio in the quarter, which was 2.1 points lower than the prior-year quarter. The components of the second quarter homeowners underlying combined ratio are on the chart on the right. Average earned premium per policy increased by 2.5% over the prior-year quarter, while underlying loss and expense per policy declined by 1.1%. Slide 10 provides a view of top and bottom line trends for Esurance. I will begin on the left with a summary of the combined ratio. Esurance\u2019s recorded combined ratio of 108.9% in the second quarter of 2016 was 1.3 points better than the same period in 2015, reflecting lower operating expenses which more than offset higher catastrophes and unfavorable auto claim frequency. As Tom mentioned earlier, the underlying loss ratio of 74.5% remains higher than where we would like it to perform in the long term. On the right, you can see Esurance\u2019s premium and policy in force trends. Growth in Esurance has been impacted by ongoing profit improvement actions, including rate increases, underwriting guideline adjustments, and decreased marketing in select geographies. Given these actions, policies, which are represented by the gray line, declined by 1.4% compared to the second quarter of 2015, while net written premium in the second quarter of 2016 grew by 5.7% compared to the same quarter a year ago, driven by higher average premiums per policy. Encompass\u2019s results are highlighted on page 11. The left hand chart summarizes our combined ratio trends. Encompass\u2019s recorded combined ratio of 104.9% in the second quarter of 2016 was 10.8 points below the prior-year quarter, driven by a lower level of catastrophes, a reduced expense ratio, and a 2.4-point improvement in the loss ratio excluding catastrophes. The underlying combined ratio of Encompass of 92.8% was 3.7 points better than the second quarter a year ago, the result of ongoing pricing and underwriting actions to achieve target margins. The chart on the right of this page shows how the size of the business has been impacted by profit improvement actions. Net written premium, as shown by the blue line, declined by 6.8% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by an 11.4% decline in policies in force, which more than offset higher average premiums from increased rates. Encompass has continued to take actions to achieve targeted returns by enhancing its pricing, contract coverage, and underwriting sophistication. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve. Steve Shebik : Thank you, Pat. Slide 12 provides an overview of Allstate Financial\u2019s results for the second quarter of 2016. We have refocused Allstate Financial over the past several years primarily on business written through the Allstate agencies and on voluntary workplace products for customers of Allstate Benefits. The annuity product line is closed to new business and is effectively in run-off. Premium and contract charges totaled $564 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 5.2% in the quarter versus the prior year. The solid growth in premium and contract charges was driven by Allstate Benefits, which grew 9.6% in the second quarter, with an increase of 468,000 policies over the prior 12 months. Allstate Financial operating income decreased to $120 million in the quarter from $139 million in the prior year. Across the top of the slide, we show net and operating income for each business. Life business operating income of $64 million in the second quarter increased $9 million compared to last year, driven by favorable mortality experience and premium growth. Allstate Benefits operating income of $29 million for the second quarter was consistent with the second quarter of last year. The annuity business generated operating income of $27 million, down $29 million from the second quarter of 2015 due to 2015\u2019s portfolio repositioning and worse mortality. The chart on the bottom right shows the liquidity need by product. For immediate annuities in the gray bar, benefits will be paid to annuitants over many years, lowering required liquidity. As a result, we\u2019ve repositioned this portfolio from longer-duration fixed income securities and are shifting to performance-based investments and sharper higher risk-adjusted returns. Now let\u2019s go on to slide 13. We\u2019ve been proactively managing the investment portfolio in response to changes in our liability profile and the low interest rate environment while reducing the portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to an eventual rise in interest rates. As we discussed in prior quarters, we have been shifting the risk posture of our portfolio over time, which is shown in the chart on the upper left. Several years ago, we began to reposition the portfolio by moving away from lending and toward ownership. This is reflected in the decreased allocation to investment-grade, fixed income, and increase in performance-based investments, such as private equity, real estate, timber, and agriculture. Our performance-based strategy is expected to generate higher but more variable returns over time. We\u2019ve created capacity for the incremental risk by strengthening our capital position to issuing preferred securities, reducing debt, decreasing exposure to natural catastrophes, and shrinking our annuity business. Total return for the quarter, on the upper right, remained strong at 1.9%, as valuations continue to be positive, reflecting lower market yields. The unrealized gain in the portfolio increased to $2.7 billion. Gross investment income is provided at the bottom left of the slide. Variability in income largely results from our performance-based investments, shown in gray. Investment yields by the business segment are provided on the bottom right. We shortened the duration of the property/liability portfolio in 2012 and 2013, resulting in an interest-bearing portfolio yield closer to current market yields, which will be more responsive to rising interest rates as a result of its shorter maturity profile. The Allstate Financial yield trend reflects the impact of last year\u2019s portfolio repositioning when we sold longer-duration fixed income securities in the immediate annuity portfolio. Except for the impact of these sales, the interest-bearing portfolio yield at Allstate Financial has been relatively stable despite the rate environment, as investment cash flows have been used largely to fund liability outflows. Yields of both segments continue to be pressured to the extent rates remain below the portfolio averages. Slide 14 provides an overview of our capital strength and financial flexibility. We finished the second quarter of 2016 with $20.6 billion of shareholders\u2019 equity, a debt to capital ratio of 19.9%, and deployable holding company assets of $2.5 billion. Book value per common share for the second quarter of 2016 was $50.05, up 4.4% from 2015, reflecting higher unrealized net capital gains. We returned over $1 billion in cash to common shareholders through the first six months of the year. We paid $240 million in common share dividends and repurchased $829 million of common shares. On June 1, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to purchase $350 million of our outstanding common stock. The completion of the ASR agreement will be on or before September 23 of this year. As of June 30, $1.2 billion remained of the $1.5 billion common share repurchase authorization. With that, let me ask Jonathan to open the lines for your questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please. Greg Peters : Good morning, everyone, and congratulations, Pat, on the promotion. Pat Macellaro : Thanks, Greg. Greg Peters : I wanted to focus on two areas, one on the rate change in your auto, and then secondly on distribution platform. In addition to the comments you made on rate change, I was looking at slide 14 in your supplement. And the auto for Allstate brand was up 3.2% in the second quarter. That\u2019s a noticeable change from previous quarters, and I\u2019m curious if there was some geographic concentration with the rate change, or is it broad-based. I think the annualized pace of that is in excess of 12%, so I\u2019m also curious about any regulatory pushback or competitive issues there too. Tom Wilson : Greg, do you want to give us your distribution question too, so we can \u2013 maybe they link together, I\u2019m not sure, but we can handle both of them that way. Greg Peters : Yes, sure. On the distribution side, I noticed that the total number of Allstate agencies, licensed sales professionals, and independent agents all increased on a year-over-year basis. And I\u2019m just curious if you can update us on what you\u2019re doing there and how you\u2019re able to grow that business in a challenging marketplace. Tom Wilson : Okay, Matt can deal with both of those. Let me just give him a little bit of air cover, which is we always encourage you not to take our quarterly results and multiply them by four. Matt Winter : Good morning, Greg, it\u2019s Matt. Thanks for the questions. I think as Pat said during his opening remarks, some of the quarterly rate change was driven by the fact that we took rate this past quarter in some extremely large states, and that impacted it disproportionately when you look at it on a countrywide impact. So you are correct, it is disproportionately high to what you had been seeing, and I certainly wouldn\u2019t extrapolate out that number for the rest of the quarter \u2013 for the rest of the year. However, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t say we\u2019re going to continue to monitor rate need and rate indication and take appropriate levels as we have. When it is primarily in smaller states, it has a smaller impact on the countrywide average. But when it\u2019s in larger states, it will have a larger impact. And so it will fluctuate because it\u2019s based upon need and indication in particular geographic areas as opposed \u2013 which has a countrywide impact, but you can\u2019t think of it as a countrywide rate increase. The second question on distribution, it\u2019s been a tough period, yet we\u2019ve been able to hold fast and slightly grow some of our distribution points of presence. It\u2019s hard to bring on new agency owners in this environment when you\u2019re taking a lot of rate, when there\u2019s a great deal of activity going on that is requiring them to respond and do things other than merely attempt to get new customers. Our termination rate and turnover rate has not changed. We have added fewer in the recent past. But we expect as this activity dissipates and lessens, we\u2019ll be able to add additional agency owners, additional LSPs [Licensed Sales Producers], and I would add additional financial specialists because we think the fact that we entered this phase early, took action quickly and aggressively will allow us to emerge quickly and position us for growth and continued growth in points of presence as well. I hope that answers your question. Greg Peters : It does, thank you very much for the answers. Tom Wilson : Greg, let me add a longer-term view to that as well. So we have 10% of the overall auto market. We have a bigger share of the lower left, but not such a big share that we don\u2019t think there\u2019s plenty of room to grow. Greg Peters : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, good morning. I was just hoping to talk a little bit about the expense level. It did rise a little bit in the quarter. And I know you can look at it year over year, but it rose from how it had been trending in the past few quarters on a sequential basis. Can you just comment on what\u2019s driving that? And I know last quarter you guys had spoken to some advertising programs rolling out in the later stages of this year. Is that still the case as we continue to see the elevated frequency trends? Tom Wilson : As you noted, we did decide we would reduce those expenses that were related to growth when we were not in the market for new customers. So Matt just mentioned, for example, not adding a bunch of new agency owners. That costs money to do that because we have to help them get started and get supported. We did launch our new advertising program already, and so you\u2019ve started to see that uptick that portion of expenses. So the expense reductions are not as great as they were in prior quarters and the year-over-year comparison. So we manage it both on a short-term and long-term basis. We try to control our expenses in total to make sure we\u2019re achieving our target returns. On the other hand, we\u2019re not willing to give up our long-term growth. So I would just say it\u2019s balanced. It\u2019s hard to predict where your expenses and your frequency and severity will be in a quarter obviously on a forward-looking basis. So we manage it on a rolling 12-months basis. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then on slide seven, where you guys go through the frequency trends, I was just trying to tie together some of the trends on both the growth and the pay side. So the pay trends improved in the quarter, while the growth trends continued to remain elevated. I\u2019m just trying to tie together why the improvement on the pay side wouldn\u2019t necessarily be an indicator that incurred frequency trends are improving. And the also within the Auto book, was there any kind of seasonality within the underlying numbers in the quarter as we think about the margins in the back half of the year? Matt Winter : Elyse, it\u2019s Matt. I\u2019ll try to answer both of those. I think just the graph, the side-by-side of gross and paid is informative because we\u2019ve tracked both and reported on both. They serve different purposes, as Pat described, and they show up differently. Clearly in gross, it\u2019s a leading indicator. So you\u2019re reporting on and showing everything that\u2019s coming in that might be a claim. And in fact, this is subject to every single change in potential opening practice in claims, how we think about it, how we capture information, and clearly there\u2019s some segment of this that is closed without payment. But for these, and especially in the most recent difficult frequency environment, we\u2019re trying to capture as much information as possible with as much granularity as possible and predict claims need, claims staffing need, so that we can provide our customers with the absolute best service in the time that they need it. So it tends to lead and it tends to over-capture obviously what is going to be on the paid side. And you have this gap. It\u2019s especially true on BI because of the long tail, and that\u2019s a timing issue. But you have a natural gap in just claims closure. You also see some small areas where it seems out of pattern, Elyse, but it\u2019s really a question of catching up. It\u2019s a question of closing out and paying a bunch of claims. It\u2019s a question of figuring out what demand is. We see this not just here, but you see it on [ph] Sebrough as well. Sometimes, we\u2019ll get hit with a big lump of [ph] Sebrough (35:28) claims from third-party carriers because they just backed up. And all of a sudden, they come in. And so I refer to it as peristalsis in our claims system. Sometimes there\u2019s a catch-up. As you had a backlog, things slowed down, and then it\u2019s pushed through. You manage to clear a lot of claims. And so it will never mirror it exactly. But it\u2019s eerily similar, if pushed over a little by time and dampened a little in terms of its volatility and variability. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thank you. And then just lastly, was there any seasonality within the auto underlying numbers in the quarter, as you think about the back half and the Q3 and the Q4 of 2016? Matt Winter : I\u2019d encourage you to look back historically on quarter-by-quarter underlying. I don\u2019t want to draw a bunch of general conclusions for you, but I think you will see there is seasonality, not only in the recorded, but there is always some seasonality in the underlying based upon weather and other activities. And so I\u2019d encourage you to look, and we do have the historical graphs, and that\u2019s apparent from taking a look at that. Tom Wilson : Elyse, we have not changed our full-year outlook, which is the way we like to look at it. As Matt points out, it bounces around by quarter. Our full-year outlook is still 88% to 90% for underlying combined ratio. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thank you very much. Pat Macellaro : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your question, please. Ryan Tunis : Hi, thanks. I guess the first one, just following up on some of Elyse\u2019s questions on the difference between paid and gross. Some of that new disclosure, I think it\u2019s a footnote in the supplement, seems to indicate that one of the biggest differences is vehicle on non-vehicle collisions. And I guess I\u2019m just trying to drill into that a little bit more, anything you can give us on either what percentage of your claims base tends to be vehicle on non-vehicle, how the average severity of those non-vehicle crashes compares to the vehicle-on-vehicle, or just how to think about the \u2013 I realize a lot of those don\u2019t close with a claim. But how do we think about the percentage of those that close with a claim versus the percentage that close with a claim on just a vehicle-on-vehicle? Matt Winter : Okay, thanks for the question, Ryan. It\u2019s Matt. So I just want to point out and restate what I said in answering Elyse\u2019s question. So we made a decision during the second half of 2015 to try to capture additional information on every claim. And as we did that, we did that for the purposes of really digging at a very granular level into what was happening in our claims pattern and make sure that we were ahead of the game in both an ability to staff it and an ability to predict, to the extent you can, emerging trends. And so as we began capturing additional information, we began capturing additional information on what we call hit fixed object or non-vehicle accidents. And the fixed object that you hit can vary depending upon the season. In January and February, that fixed object could be a snow bank. It\u2019s less likely to be a snow bank in July and August. Sometimes it\u2019s something that can result in a claim, like a mailbox or somebody\u2019s tree or a garage door or something like that, and sometimes it\u2019s something that would not result in a claim. So we wanted to capture additional information. We did. And as a result, we were probably capturing and continue to capture some incidents that, when you look at it, you\u2019re less likely to think it\u2019s going to result in a claim. But to be complete, we wanted to capture everything. It allowed us to make a more informed assessment of liability earlier in the process. As we disclosed in the supplement, as a result of that change, there has been a gross frequency per PD increase, and we quantified that. It\u2019s about 1.5 points in the third quarter of 2015. It\u2019s about two points in the fourth quarter, and it\u2019s about three points in the second quarter of 2016. And so you\u2019ll see adjusted numbers in the supplement as well as the \u201cgross\u201d numbers, unadjusted numbers. Most of those additional claims that we\u2019re capturing are closed without a payment, so they have no impact to the income statement and they\u2019re not impacting our paid, but we wanted to capture it to see trends. And when you\u2019re as large as we are, every little change in what you capture in claims opening practices can influence the gross number. Tom Wilson : Ryan, this is Tom. When Matt said this, I want to go a level below that, which is in doing our net income and our reserving processes, we use actual claim counts and severity by type of loss. As you know, some longer-tail businesses where they don\u2019t have the data that we do on a real-time basis, they book to estimated loss ratios. When Matt is talking about what we\u2019re doing with claim counts, that\u2019s all factored in. So we have greater precision in the way we estimate our current income levels. Ryan Tunis : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then I guess just as a follow-up, we\u2019ve heard some of the life companies this quarter talk about the impact of the pullback in interest rates both on the income statement and also some charges. I guess just with Allstate, maybe looking out over the next 12 months, I don\u2019t know, maybe even 24 months, how should we be thinking about the income statement of low interest rates, and I guess also the impact it could have in terms of GAAP charges or stat [statutory] charges on the runoff life block? Thanks. Steve Shebik : So, Ryan, this is Steve. Let me talk a little bit about our investment portfolio, which I think is what you\u2019re referring to. I made a comment in the prepared remarks about the difference between the portfolio yield and the current yield you might be able to reinvest in. And for property/liability, it\u2019s fairly close. For life, there\u2019s a difference. Obviously, we have longer duration assets. We\u2019re getting good yields on those today, but they slowly run off over time. The good news is for us, unlike many other companies, we\u2019ve been paying out our run-off annuity liabilities with a lot of that cash flow that\u2019s coming from the portfolio. So we haven\u2019t had to reinvest in the lower interest rate environment. Today, that\u2019s slowing down a little bit. So we have some cash flow beyond that, which we\u2019re investing primarily in performance-based investments, as we said, which really is designed to match up to our liability profile, which is longer duration than many of our competitors in terms of \u2013 because we\u2019re running it off. So if you look at that \u2013 and performance-based investments we believe would earn substantially higher albeit variable returns over a period of time than you would in fixed income. So we feel our income for Allstate Financial, should hold on to investments, should hold reasonably well. There\u2019s going to be a slowdown turn, as you can imagine, given some cash flow and some of the market environments and what we do in managing the portfolio on a routine basis. In terms of charges, probably I think you\u2019re thinking of a premium deficiency charge. We aggregate all of our life and annuity businesses, and we disclose this in the footnotes in the financial statements. Right now, we have stat sufficiency in that. We continue to look at that, and once again, having it be a performance-based investment will help us significantly in terms of increasing and holding the returns we have in those long-dated annuities. I hope that helps \u2013 answers your question. Ryan Tunis : And I guess how about on a stat basis, like an [ph] AAT) or anything like that at year end? Steve Shebik : On a stat basis, we do look at that at year end, as you say. I don\u2019t have any really current comments on that. But once again, it really is based upon where your investment income is coming out and moving more towards performance-based investing should help us on that. Tom Wilson : And last year we did take a charge on stat of about $259 million. Ryan Tunis : Okay, thanks so much for your answers, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Your question, please. Josh Stirling : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the call and congratulations on the quarter. So I was hoping you guys can \u2013 we\u2019re all sitting here trying to figure out how to model your earnings going out over the next couple of years and balancing basically frequency trends, severity trends you\u2019re talking about, as well as the very active pricing campaign you\u2019re managing. And I was wondering if you could help us. I\u2019m not asking for guidance per se, but help us understand. Remind us a bit at the business segment level what the underlying combined ratio targets you guys are trying to get to are. Because we can do our own math about judging how long you\u2019ll get there, but I think it\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve had that conversation. And as you\u2019ve made a lot of changes in Encompass and Esurance in particular, I don\u2019t think that we actually really know for certain what we should be looking to as the long-term goals for those businesses. Tom Wilson : Good morning, Josh. Let me go way up for a minute and I\u2019ll come down. So we expect all of our businesses to earn a current return on the business they write over our cost of capital. So we start there, and that\u2019s true with all of our businesses today. But then what we do is we adjust it for what our strategies and the volatility of earnings are. So when you look at the underlying combined ratio for homeowners, for example, it\u2019s lower than you would see for the other businesses because it utilizes more capital because it\u2019s more volatile. We have a very sophisticated process of allocating economic capital, not just to those lines of business, but then Matt and his team push it down by state. So we\u2019ve always talked about the system we have. That system includes taking economic capital for homeowners down to places like Mississippi on the coast is going to be different than Wisconsin in the woods. And so homeowners will always have a lower underlying combined ratio and lower underlying loss ratio than you would see from the auto business. The auto business, we don\u2019t give a target like some of our competitors do. But if you looked at where we\u2019ve operated, it\u2019s been where GEICO and Progressive is, which call it the [ph] mid-90s%. That\u2019s a place where our customers have been willing to give us a good return for providing the services we do. That\u2019s where we look to be at, in that zone, but we don\u2019t have a specific number that we give out either by quarter or year. If you look at the other property/liability businesses, they look more like auto insurance than they do homeowner insurance. If you go over to Esurance, we look at it on a longer-term basis than just the underlying combined ratio because of the way the accounting works on getting new customers. So you spend all of your money up front getting new customers, and it gets expensed right away, as opposed to in the Allstate channel, we\u2019re providing service all along. So the commissions we paid our customers to provide that service get amortized all along. So you should expect to see a higher recorded combined ratio for Esurance than you would for Allstate because of that accounting, but also because of its size and the growth potential we have in that segment. So as long as Don\u2019s team is creating economic value, we will continue to invest because we believe we\u2019re creating long-term shareholder value, even if it hurts current earnings. So if you look at the underwriting loss, we\u2019ve been running underwriting loss since we bought Esurance, but it\u2019s double its size. And if you double its size, we believe we\u2019ve created a lot of economic value. Encompass looks more like the Allstate channel and customer segment than the other one. So that\u2019s how we think \u2013 obviously, we have similar conversations for the life business and Allstate Benefits. Is that helpful? Josh Stirling : That makes sense. If I could just \u2013 I\u2019ll use my one last follow-up on similar points. If I try to keep it at 50,000 feet, it feels like your guys\u2019 auto businesses are running a couple of points below \u2013 or above where you would like them to be. If we assume that you can fix those over the next couple of years, that would be fantastic for margins. One, is that sort of the right way to think about if you guys can get ahead with pricing and/or you get a tailwind because frequency trends stabilize or even reverse? And then I guess the other thing that\u2019s implicit in that assumption is that you\u2019ll be able to maintain margins you\u2019ve currently been getting in homeowners. And we haven\u2019t been talking about that quite as much because auto has been the focus. But does that \u2013 if you\u2019re thinking about this big picture and staying at that level, are those sort of the right ways we should be thinking about this? Tom Wilson : Yes, it is. I would say, if you look at where we operated the auto insurance business with flat severity, as Matt pointed out, for a long period of time we\u2019ve had flat severity \u2013 or sorry, flat frequency. Thank you, Pat. We would like flat severity. But we were able to operate that business at a combined ratio below where it is today. We see no change in our capabilities relative to our competitors, no change in the overall competitive environment that tells us we can\u2019t be back in that space. It will take us some time given that those frequency numbers have been headed up and we price on a lag basis, but we see no reason why we can\u2019t get there. The homeowners business has been successfully repositioned, and we\u2019re zeroing in on around four years of the new environment, and we see no reason why we can\u2019t continue to maintain that profitability where it is today. Josh Stirling : Great. Thank you, good luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Your question, please. Amit Kumar : Thanks and good morning, and thanks for fitting me in. Just two quick questions, if I may. First of all, again, going back to slide seven, could you perhaps give us more color as to what exactly are these type of claims that are being closed without payment, and has that percentage increased? Tom Wilson : The percentage on it bounces around a lot. For example, let\u2019s say somebody called us and they had a claim and their deductible is $1,000, and the damage was $700. We close that claim without payment. There are lots of reasons. It could be they called us, and the other person was at fault. And so there are lots of things that happen where we don\u2019t have to actually pay money. But we want to know that somebody has a claim so that we can respond proactively and do what we get paid for, which is help them at that time of trouble. Steve Shebik : On the macro level, it fluctuates a lot, but the trend hasn\u2019t changed. Amit Kumar : Got it, that\u2019s actually quite helpful. The other question which we were getting was on advertising. I know you talked about this. Going back, I thought the thought process was that the advertising piece will come back once the book is fixed and under control. And I think some people were surprised on the tick up in the advertising level. Maybe just talk about that. Did we misunderstand you at that point, or you have greater comfort where we are right now and hence that\u2019s why it\u2019s ticking up? Tom Wilson : I can\u2019t speak for what people thought we said, but what I can do is say we\u2019re comfortable doing more advertising. But I would also point out, it\u2019s really marketing because there\u2019s a tremendous \u2013 we have made a huge shift in our allocations away from TV to digital over the last couple of years. So you might not see as many ads on TV, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not out banging away trying to find new customers. But we\u2019re comfortable from both an ongoing standpoint we need to invest to make sure our brand is out there and relevant; and secondly, that we\u2019re advertising for the types of customers that we have the ability to take in. Amit Kumar : And does that run rate go up from here or remain stable? Tom Wilson : It varies by quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 if you\u2019re trying to, Amit, I wouldn\u2019t get too hung up on it. I would think about expenses overall. We think about expenses as a way to provide both on opportunity for us to grow and great service for our customers. Right now, our expense levels are down. If we had a lower loss ratio and we felt like we could expand, we would then continue to invest until we thought the average acquisition cost was too high. Amit Kumar : Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future. Tom Wilson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : Thank you and good morning. The first question is on the inflection point on your core loss ratio in the auto book. You\u2019ve been starting raising price actively the second quarter of last year. Given the short-tail nature of your business, I was wondering when do you think that will eventually earn through above your loss cost trends. And also your second quarter this year, a big increase in terms of approved rate increases. Do we have to wait until these chunks earn in to see that inflection point? Steve Shebik : The answer to the first one is it all depends what you think is going to happen to frequency. And we can\u2019t predict the bottom part of that chart that Pat and Matt talked about. We can\u2019t predict that. So as Matt indicated, as long as it\u2019s going up, we will continue to adjust our pricing to reflect the cost that we have to cover for our customers. When it will go through will be \u2013 and you\u2019ll see it in the P&L, is when it exceeds the growth in frequency and severity. It didn\u2019t happen this quarter versus the second quarter of next year, but we don\u2019t price just to hold even. So at some point, we would expect to get back to that loss ratio that we talked about earlier. Matt Winter : And I\u2019d add, Kai, I think you asked about the timing. It does \u2013 since they\u2019re six-month policies, it does take 12 full months to fully earn in, and it\u2019s earned in in the 13th month. So you can\u2019t accelerate that. That\u2019s just a function of how the rates work in the system. And so you can look at what our effective rate is, and we talk about the effective rate increase and how much is likely to burn in as a result when it\u2019s fully developed, and some of that will actually burn in, in 2017 of what we took in second quarter of 2016. Kai Pan : That\u2019s great. The second question is on Arity. Could you talk even more about your business model there? And over time, what\u2019s the value you could provide to Allstate, both strategic as well as economic value to your franchise, and how much investment you need to make in that unit? Tom Wilson : Okay, Kai, let me answer it first with a two-component stance. One is the overall environment and second is Allstate specifically. So if you look at the personal transportation system, we think it offers one of the biggest economic opportunities facing America, the restructuring of it. Just a few statistics, there are 240 million cars in the United States. They\u2019re worth about $4 trillion. Direct cost to maintain and run those cars is about $2 trillion. You can add another $1 trillion of indirect costs, and it\u2019s very inefficient. Capacity utilization is about 4% in total. It\u2019s about 33% at peak hours. And then you see one person in a car most of the time rather than multiple people. So everywhere I look I see idle cars, and if they\u2019re moving they only have one passenger. At the same time, there are about 30,000 people killed in that system, and there\u2019s billions of hours spent either sitting in traffic or waiting looking for a parking spot. We can do better. If it was your system, you\u2019d shut it down and rebuild it. That will be done over time. We believe it has the opportunity to increase personal household consumption by up to 5% on an annual basis, so there\u2019s big money here. The train is on the track. It\u2019s moving and it\u2019s picking up speed. So what\u2019s Allstate going to do about that? First, we can use the telematics data to improve the accuracy of our pricing. So today, most companies estimate the chances of people having an accident by their history and where they live. With Drivewise, we can look contextually at everything you do about driving and price it with real driving behavior. That gives us a more accurate price. We\u2019re also testing pricing plans so that you can continue to pay us like we do today, over six months, as Matt talked about, or you can pay us per mile if you want to. There are lots of things that will happen in the personal transportation industry that we believe creates great opportunity for Allstate. At the same time, we\u2019re broadening that value proposition to customers beyond just pricing so that they get more from Allstate than just advice on how to protect themselves and more than help in fixing their car when they get in an accident. So today, for example, we give them safe driving tips as to how to do better driving. We connect them with roadside so they can be \u2013 contextually we can get there faster. We\u2019re also doing a number of things in terms of giving them rewards. So we\u2019re both doing a better job on what we currently offer, and we\u2019re expanding the offering we give them. Now there are many companies that want to get in this space, and we think we have a natural way in because it\u2019s direct and it\u2019s low friction in terms of giving customers direct benefit from the connection. So it\u2019s our belief that we can use that connection then for multiple purposes such as road usage or providing real-time safety advice, consumer benefits that are determined by a customer\u2019s interest and the time-and-place specific location they\u2019re at. So as a result of that, we created Arity as a way of bundling those services together on one platform. So the strategy is strengthen our existing businesses and find new revenue sources by leveraging those connections with customers. We don\u2019t disclose the amount of money. We don\u2019t get to 1 million customers without spending some money on it, but we don\u2019t break that number out. Kai Pan : Thank you very much. Pat Macellaro : Hey, Jonathan, we\u2019ll take one more question. Operator : Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Your question, please. Sarah DeWitt : Hi, good morning and thanks for squeezing me in. I\u2019d be interested to get your perspective on loss trends. Why do you think they haven\u2019t stabilized yet, particularly given we\u2019ve lapped on lower gas prices and the economy isn\u2019t booming? Tom Wilson : I think you answered part of the question there, which is people do three things in their cars. They go to work, they run errands, and they take trips. It\u2019s about a third each of those roughly speaking. So as more people are working, they drive to work more. That creates more economic activity, which also makes the roads more crowded. The trips tend to \u2013 errands tend to not move around that much. And then you have trips. And so lower gas prices help. Matt, anything you want to add? Matt Winter : I would add, Sarah, in addition to the miles driven, which is, as Tom said, miles driven is really a factor of gas prices, employment rate because that drives those behaviors. The other component that is a little more difficult to quantify but we know it\u2019s out there is the level of distracted driving that\u2019s taking place today. And that distracted driving, the use of cellphones while driving, the texting, Facebook surfing, we\u2019ve all watched it. Some of us have been victims of it on the road. We all watch people sliding around in the lanes. And the combination of increased number of cars on the road due to the first thing, due to the miles driven, means you have a greater density of cars on the road with less margin of error. So there\u2019s less space in between those cars. When you add distracted driving to that and you have people swerving and not paying attention and going to hard stops, it\u2019s an increased likelihood that they\u2019re going to hit somebody else. So it\u2019s a perfect storm to have a greater number of cars on the road driving faster, and we have lots of evidence that speed has increased as well. Our Drivewise data is showing us greater number of trips, greater length of those trips, and greater speed during those trips. So it\u2019s a bad combination when you add to it people looking at their cell phone instead of being focused on their driving. Tom Wilson : And then as we mentioned, as well the loss cost and the same trends that Matt and Pat talked about, which is cars are more expensive. Knock off your mirror, it\u2019s $1,000, not $150, because it\u2019s got all the sensors and stuff on it. Tom Wilson : So let me just close with we take a proactive approach to the current environment, making sure we invest for the long-term strategic growth opportunity. So we\u2019re adapting to the higher cost of socio and auto insurance, as most of you have asked us about. But I want to be clear. It\u2019s comprehensive in a multi-faceted approach. It\u2019s not just about raising price. So we\u2019re taking a more segmented approach to that. We are managing risk-adjusted returns to create shareholder value. That\u2019s like what we did in homeowners, where we got smaller to get better, or as we\u2019re doing today in payout annuities. We are focused on growth, whether that\u2019s Allstate Benefits, Allstate agencies and their relationships with the 16 million households, Esurance, or our telematics offering. We are investing for long-term growth and will continue to do so. So we have a strategy, resources, and a team to continue to create value for our shareholders. So thank you again for spending time with us this quarter and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Allstate Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program Mr. John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. John Griek - The Allstate Corp.: Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for Allstate's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by our Chairman and CEO, Tom Wilson; Chief Financial Officer, Steve Shebik, and myself, we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the third quarter, and posted the results presentation we will discuss this morning. These documents are available on our website at allstateinvestors.com. As noted on the first slide, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2015, the slides, and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in our news release and our investor supplement. We are recording this call, and a replay will be available following its conclusion. And I'll be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Well, good morning. Thank you again for investing your time to keep up on our progress at Allstate. I'll start with an overview of results and John and Steve will provide more detail. Also here with us this morning are Matt Winter, our President; Don Civgin, the President to our Emerging Businesses; Mary Jane Fortin, President to Allstate Life & Retirement; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. This quarter, we delivered balanced operating results underlying auto margins improved, homeowners' results remain strong, and we generated a good total return on the investment portfolio. Let's start on slide 2. Net income for the quarter was $491 million and operating income was $474 million, which was $1.26 per share. Operating income was adversely affected by elevated catastrophe losses and a $99 million increase in reserves for discontinued lines. The property-liability recorded combined ratio was 95.5 for the quarter and the underlying combined ratio was 88, both for the quarter and the first nine months of the year, which is at the favorable end of the full-year outlook that we gave you in February of 88 to 90. Investment income was 7.3% lower than last year's third quarter, reflecting last year we sold about $2 billion of long duration bonds in the payout annuity portfolio and results in a lower interest income and we had a strong return on the performance-based portfolio in 2015's third quarter. Total investment returns remain strong at 1.3% for the quarter, and 5.2% for the year, driven by both net investment income and price appreciation in the bond portfolio. Let's go to slide 3. On a total company basis, about half of the decline in property-liability policies was offset by providing consumers a broad set of unique products using different brands and distribution channels, most notably because of Allstate Benefits. The results for each of the four segments of the property-liability market are shown on the bottom diagram on this page here. So, the Allstate brand, which is in the lower left, comprises 90% of premiums written that serves customers who prefer branded product and value local relationships. Policies in force, the Allstate brand declined in the third quarter of last year by 2.3% as we continue to raise auto insurance prices, and you can see the impact of those actions on both new business and retention. Allstate brand auto net written premium grew by 4.1%, which reflects a 7.7% increase in average written premium. If you continue down that column, the Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio was 95.9 for the third quarter of 2016, which is 2 points better than the prior-year quarter. Homeowners in the next column had a recorded combined ratio of 75.9. The underlying combined ratio in the far right column was 86.9 for Allstate brand. Moving over to the right, Esurance serves customers that prefer a branded product but are comfortable handling their own insurance needs. Policies in force declined 0.6% from a year ago, due to lower new business and retention. Net written premium grew by 5.4%, as the 6.4% increase in auto average premium, more than offset the policy decline. The recorded and underlying combined ratios of 109.8 and 106.0 reflected different economic model in this segment, where acquisition costs are expensed really in the first policy year versus spread out as commissions over the life of the policy. The underlying auto loss ratio of 75.7 is still above our long-term target, so we continue to implement margin improvement actions. Encompass in the upper left competes for customers in our local advice, are less concerned about a branded experience and are served by independent agencies. Encompass remains focused on improving returns, and consequently, policies in force declined by 12.6% from the same quarter a year ago. The recorded and underlying combined ratios of 98.3 and 89.3 in the third quarter were better than third quarter of 2015. Answer Financial in the upper right serves brand neutral self-service customers, it an aggregator that does not underwrite insurance risk. Total non-proprietary written premium of $158 million in the quarter grew by 6% from the prior-year. Let's turn to slide 4. As you know, we establish operating priorities for each year to focus our decision and to provide clarity to all of our stakeholders. The first three priorities are intertwined and relate to ensuring that we have a profitable and sustainable business model. We balance these efforts with a focus on both short-term result and long-term value creation. To better serve customers, we're building new capabilities for Allstate agencies, so they can be better trusted advisors. For example, we successfully introduced new personalized insurance proposal and have now sent out over 2 million of those. At the same time to earn an appropriate return on capital, we've increased auto insurance prices, which has a negative impact in customer satisfaction and growth. To grow the entire enterprise, we're leveraging our brands, customer relationships and capabilities, including having Esurance sell homeowners' insurance and expanding Allstate Benefits. As you know, we proactively invested our $81 billion investment portfolio to achieve the best risk adjusted return over a time period that are either appropriate for the liabilities they back, or are consistent with our risk appetite on capital. Steve will talk more about the investment results in just a minute. Lastly, to create long-term growth, we're expanding Arity connected car platform and working to further expand our portfolio of consumer protection products. Now let me turn it over to John. John Griek - The Allstate Corp.: Thanks, Tom. I'll start on slide 5. Property-liability earned premium of $7.9 billion in the third quarter of 2016 was 2.9% higher than the same period last year. During the first three quarters of 2016, earned premium grew by 3.5%. Third quarter catastrophe losses of $481 million were 78.1% higher than the prior-year quarter. Catastrophe losses of $2.3 billion through the first nine months of 2016 were $908 million higher than the first three quarters of last year. The recorded combined ratio for property-liability was 95.5 in the third quarter of 2016. When we exclude catastrophes in prior-year reserve re-estimates, the underlying combined ratio for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 were both 88.0, which is better than 2015, and at the favorable end of our annual outlook range of 88 to 90. Property-liability operating income of $452 million in the third quarter of 2016 was 17.8% below prior-year results due to higher catastrophe losses and a $99 million reserve increase for discontinued lines. In the chart on the bottom left, the blue line represents net written premium growth, while the red line shows policy in force growth. Property-liability's policies in force were 2.6% below the third quarter of 2015, while net written premium increased by 2.1% over the same time period. These trends were heavily influenced by our auto profit improvement actions across underwriting brands. The widening gap between these two trend lines reflects increased average premium per policy. The bottom right graph shows the recorded combined ratio in red, in comparison to the underlying combined ratio in the blue bars and illustrates that most of the quarter-to-quarter volatility is due to catastrophe losses. Going to slide 6, the chart on the top left shows the quarterly underlying loss ratios and combined ratios for Allstate brand auto. The underlying combined ratio of 95.9 in the third quarter of 2016, improved by 2.2 points compared to the third quarter of 2015, driven by a lower underlying loss ratio. As seen on the chart on the top right, annualized average premium increased to $966 or 7% compared to the prior-year, while underlying loss and expenses increased by 4.5%, increasing the favorable gap to $40. Underlying loss and expenses are shown by the red line. Underlying losses are based on a sophisticated and segmented approach to establishing loss reserves. We use a wide range of operational and financial statistics and multiple techniques to estimate loss costs. For example, gross frequency reflects actual notice counts reported in a particular time period, and we use that data to record losses and reserves for each notice count received, as opposed to estimating an accident year loss ratio based on aggregate claims data. Similarly, paid frequency is used to estimate how many of those reported claims will ultimately be paid and helps us measure and better manage paid severity claim staffing. To provide you insight into the underlying results, we disclosed several frequency statistics and paid severity trends for the property damage and bodily injury coverages, which are shown on the bottom two graphs. Property damage claims represent about 20% of loss costs and reflect both the frequency of accidents and the average paid severity per claims. As you can see, frequency in the blue bar began to rise in the last quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015, and then accelerated until being essentially flat for the last two quarters. Paid severity, however, continues to increase, although the rate of increase has come down throughout 2016. Bodily injury claims comprised about 30% of loss costs and have more volatile underlying statistics because of the longer time period it takes to settle these claims and the greater dispersion in the amounts paid per claim. The decrease in paid frequency and increase in paid severity during the third quarter are related and reflects payment mix and claim closure patterns that were impacted by changes in bodily injury claims processes to require enhanced documentation of injuries and related medical treatments. And, as a result, fewer claims were opened and paid in the third quarter of 2016. But those that were paid had higher average payments. Normalizing for the process enhancement made to bodily injury claims in the quarter, both injury paid claim frequency and severity consistently measured would have been generally consistent with those observed during the first half of 2016. One of the components of our profit improvement plan is claims operational excellence. We are always looking for ways to improve claims processes and continue to settle claims fairly, deliver the best possible claims experience to our customers, and settle claims as efficiently as possible. And while claims process changes have impacted some of our operational statistics, we take the impact of those changes into account when setting reserves. And as a result, claims process changes have not impacted our reported underwriting results. Slide 7 provides detail on the auto profit improvement plan. We have continued to diligently pursue approval for higher auto prices where appropriate. And you can see on the lower left chart that in the third quarter of 2016, we received approved rate increases estimated at $209 million across all three brands. This brings our total for the first nine months of 2016 to $1.2 billion, higher than the full-year of 2015. The chart on the lower right shows average premium increased 7.7% compared to the prior-year quarter, an acceleration of the trend we have seen since the middle of last year. And average net earned premium, shown by the gray line, lags average written premium and is up 6%. Moving to slide 8, the chart on the left shows Allstate brand auto policies in force have decreased, which reflects the auto margin improvement plan and are 2.5% below the prior-year quarter. The chart on the right highlights that while new business and customer retention have been impacted by our profit improvement actions, our absolute levels of new business production have stabilized over the last couple quarters. Slide 9 highlights the continued strength of Allstate brand homeowners. The chart on the left shows the recorded combined ratio remained a very strong 75.9 in the quarter, despite significant catastrophe losses. On a trailing 12 month basis, the recorded combined ratio was 84.3. The chart on the right shows annualized average earned premium per policy increased by 2.1% over the prior-year quarter and average underlying loss and expense per policy increased by 2.4%. The gap between these two measures improved by $7 compared to the third quarter of last year. And now, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steven E. Shebik - The Allstate Corp.: Thanks, John. Slide 10 provides overview of our profitability and growth trends for Esurance and Encompass. The Esurance recorded combined ratio as shown on the top left chart, was 109.8 in the third quarter and 106.0 in catastrophes, prior-year reserve re-estimates, and the amortization of intangibles are excluded. You'll remember, with the direct distribution model, combined ratios are impacted by acquisition expenses being written off much faster than the agency channel, where commissions are spread over the policy life. This result also adversely impacted by expenses related to expanding into homeowners insurance and new markets. The underlying loss ratio of 74.7 is higher than our long-term target and we will continue to take actions to raise Esurance returns. On the top right, Esurance written premium was up 5.4%, while policies in force declined by 0.6% points compared to a year ago, reflecting the auto improvement initiatives. The chart on the bottom left shows Encompass' improvement in both recorded and underlying combined ratios. The recorded combined ratio of 98.3 was 3 points better than the third quarter a year ago, and the underlying combined ratio of 89.3, improved by 1.6 points. The chart on the bottom right show the top line trend, which you can see was impacted by profit improvement actions. Policies in force, shown on the bottom right by the gray line, declined by 12.6%, while net written premium, represented by the blue line, declined by 9.7%. Encompass will continue to take pricing, underwriting, and expense actions in order to achieve target margins. Turning to slide 11, Allstate Financial premiums and contract charges totaled $571 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of 6.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Allstate Benefits grew 11.3% in the third quarter, with an increase of 444,000 policies over the prior 12 months. Allstate Financial's operating income and net income were $94 million and $80 million in the third quarter of 2016 respectively. Operating income was $44 million lower than the third quarter of 2015, due primarily to lower investment income. Across the bottom, we show net and operating income for each business. The Allstate Life business operating income of $51 million in the third quarter decreased $7 million compared to last year due to higher expenses and lower investment margins. Allstate Benefits operating income of $25 million for the third quarter was relatively consistent with the third quarter of last year. The Annuity business generated operating income of $18 million, down $36 million from third quarter 2015, primarily due to reduced investment income resulting from the 2015 portfolio repositioning and lower limited partnership income compared to a very strong prior-year quarter. At the top right of the slide, we provide the liability balance and investment mix for our immediate annuity business before and after the portfolio repositioning. The proceeds from the sale of long-duration bonds are being invested over time in performance-based and public equity investments as you can see by the increased allocation of the assets in the chart. While we will maintain a significant allocation to interest-bearing investments, we will continue to increase our performance-based investments, which are well suited to the long-dated immediate annuity liabilities. Slide 12 shows our investment results. We increased our emphasis of performance-based investments after the financial crisis to replace market risk with idiosyncratic risk by emphasizing ownership over lending. This increased allocation to investments, such as private equity, real estate, timber and agriculture related businesses from $4.1 billion at year end 2012 to $5.8 billion in 2016, as shown in the upper left chart. These investments require higher economic and regulatory capital, but we expect it will deliver attractive long-term economic returns for our shareholders. Total return for the third quarter in the upper right was a solid 1.3%, reflecting a contribution from investment income of 90 basis points and an increase in the portfolio's value primarily from lower market yields. Gross investment income is shown on the bottom left graph. You can see performance-based investment results shown in gray are the primary source of income variability between quarters. Performance-based investments generating income of $147 million for the quarter, somewhat lower than the strong results from last year. Investment yield by business segment is shown at the bottom right. The property-liability yield is closer to current market yields as a result of its shorter duration. Allstate Financial's yield reflects the impact of last year's immediate annuity portfolio repositioning, but the year remains higher due to its longer duration and because investment cash flows have been used largely to fund liability reductions. Slide 13 illustrates the continued strength of our capital position and highlights our financial flexibility. Shareholders' equity increase of $20.9 billion in the third quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 19.6%, a reduction of 0.4% points from the prior-year quarter. Book value per common share of $51.48 increased by 8.3% over the same period a year ago, primarily due to increased unrealized gains in the investment portfolio and income generation, partially offset by capital return to shareholders. We held $2.7 billion of Holding Company assets at quarter's end, which when combined with our modest leverage ratio provides a high degree of financial flexibility. During the third quarter, we returned $389 million to common shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. At the beginning of third quarter, we returned almost $1.5 billion to our common shareholders. Now, I'll ask Jonathan to open the line up for your questions. Operator : Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question please? Elyse, you might have your phone on mute. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, sorry. Good morning. First question in terms of the commentary that you provided on severity in terms of bodily injury and the process changes you saw in the quarter, so it seems like that was just a reconfiguration between frequency and severity and we'll see those trends move back to normal in the fourth quarter? So, I guess, is it the right way to think about it, that there was no real impact on your underlying auto margin from those changes? Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah, Elyse. It's Matt Winter. Thanks for the question. Well, as you correctly pointed out, there's a fluctuation as you see on slide 6, you see some offset between the frequency and severity. That being said, there were some process changes that do influence some of those results, so we'll see it normalize, but it may not go back to exactly where it was previously, because there were some of the changes, as John referred to in his remarks. There's some enhanced documentation requirements. So the next changes, I think in response to a question you asked last quarter, I talked about the timing impact and the peristalsis that sometimes occurs in the claims area, where you have a buildup of claims that are then processed. And especially in BI with the long tail on it, you can see that happen. So, you can expect to see some fluctuation, but the general trend here that you see at the bottom right on slide 6, which is that overall, the combination in frequency and severity is declining and offsetting itself, that we expect to continue. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. And then just a follow-on to that, as you said, getting to a more favorable loss cost environment when we talk about frequency and severity, how do you guys think about what type of rate you need to take from here? I mean, the level of rate increase did slow a bit in the quarter. Just kind of a forward view as you think about the rate you might take into Q4 and into 2017, just kind of high level? Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: Well, I can't give you \u2013 we don't forecast or predict rate that we're going to take in the future. What I can tell you is that we continue to look at actual rate need, and the rate need is based upon paid trends. We look at that rate need, we look at our indications and we make determinations on the localized basis. Take into consideration economic capital, the rate needs, our competitive position and a bunch of other criteria in determining what our rate need is and in determining what rate we'll take. But I think it's impossible for me to predict for you what that will look like in the future. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: This is Tom. Let me add one thought. As we increase rates and obviously as our costs go up, we need to recover those costs, so that's part of it. If in fact those costs moderate over time, you expect that component of increases to go down. That said, we still need to increase our margin to where it has been historically. So, I think you should expect to see our price increases stay above our cost increases, those are the times when we get back our target margin. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your question please? Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks so much. I guess, couple of questions here just outside of auto. But in Allstate Financial, as we look at this quarter post disposition of Lincoln Benefit, should we be looking at these levels as sort of where you expect them to be? It seems like there's maybe a little bit of variability on one element in the business, but the others seem to be squarely at that run rate. Just love to get some, a little bit of color on that? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Mike, let me make just a comment, strategic about the positioning we talked about, then Mary Jane can talk about the results at Allstate Life and Allstate Benefits. So, first, Lincoln Benefit, I think it was 2014 we sold it. So, we kind of came around the track on that one already. And so you saw that really beginning in last year's numbers. This year, what you're seeing, it's a different strategic choice, which is the choice to do a different asset liability matching program in the Annuity business. So, as Steve mentioned we have about $12 billion of payments that are due over the next 40 years to 50 years in that immediate annuity business. Of course, we have to have investments that generate returns to make those payments. With current interest rates, it would not generate, we took all that money and invested it today. First, we couldn't get the right duration. Secondly, the rate on that would not be enough to generate enough earnings to pay all those amounts off, so we would then have to put some capital in. What we've chosen to do is put the capital in now and invest in equities, which will generate a higher return. When you get past the 10-year period, the return on equities is twice that of bonds, and the risk is about the same. So, we think that's a good use of shareholder capital from a strategic standpoint, that's a different use of capital than the capital you're talking about freeing up from Lincoln Benefit. Mary Jane, might want to make some comments about Life and Benefit. Mary Jane Bartolotta Fortin - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah, after that. So, for the Allstate Life business, this quarter, the earnings were down; and in this quarter, we did have our annual review of DAC unlock. So this quarter does have a $2 million impact in the Life business for that. And also, we did have some one-time expenses that did impact the quarter. So, that is impacting the results this quarter. We have been running favorable in our mortality, which is \u2013 for the last four quarters, we have been experiencing favorable mortality, which has been impacting those results in a positive way. In terms of the Annuities, as Tom mentioned, we've been actively putting the $2 billion to work, $1.3 billion has been put to work year-to-date. The returns on the performance-based investments were 10% in the quarter, which is in line with our long-term expectation. So that really reflects kind of the run rate for the Annuity business. So, we'll continue to actively invest in that asset class, which will generate earnings additionally over time. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. And then, Tom, one question for you, I guess, on Esurance. I remember post the transaction, you talked a lot about economic value of policies and sort of thinking about that platform on a marginal basis. I guess what we have seen here recently is, we've been taking a lot of rate action consistent with what you're doing in the rest of the auto book. I guess, I would think, like at a time like this, when you're still smaller than the two big direct peers, that this would be like the exact time that you would want to really grow that business, maybe at a time when others are not growing or at least everyone is not growing as rapidly. Could you just comment a little bit about on that and how you're thinking? It seems like, feels like, maybe Esurance is managing a little bit more the output in terms of earnings as opposed to that sort of platform building element? Thanks. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Okay. Yeah. Thank you, Mike. First, Esurance is a better company now than when we bought it, because of the skills and capabilities be brought to it whether that's branding, marketing, claims, pricing preferred, customers getting into the homeowners business. So, we've added value. And it's a good, strong company, and a much stronger competitor now than it was five years ago. It has grown a lot. It's doubled in size. We accepted a lower return on capital from the auto insurance business at Esurance during that growth than we did from the Allstate brand, because we wanted to lean into the growth as you point out. But it was always above our cost of capital. So, we're always like, okay, as Matt, Don and I always talk about -- we're like \"okay, we'll take a lower return, but it's got to be above what our cost is, because we should be creating shareholder value as we grow.\" That continues to be the case. We continue to write it above our cost of capital as we look at the vintage years of each of the products. That said, when we ran into the increase in frequency and severity that impacted all of the brands, we chose to slow growth some, because we don't want to write it at below the cost of capital. We've now got our pricing position in a better place. So, I do expect that we'll begin to grow that business again like we'll grow our other businesses. But I don't feel like we're at the place right now where we should throw hundreds of millions of dollars of marketing money at growth there. In part because, while we've dramatically improved the brand, we still need to get our consideration and awareness up. And that takes a number of years to invest in that. So, we like what we got. It's been growing. I think it can be \u2013 it certainly has broadened our strategic platform and gave us a broader set of capabilities to compete in the market with. But, it's not to the point where I feel like we should run hundreds of millions of dollars of underwriting losses. That said, we don't really manage them to the P&L. We manage them to the economics, and because we're big enough, we can take the underwriting losses from that business, if we believe it's economic. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Your question please? Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. On the severity trends, travelers saw an uptick from higher attorney involvement, more fatalities and more occupants per vehicles. And they suggested they might be recognizing a trend before the rest of the industry. Are you seeing anything on this front or how are you avoiding this? Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: It's Matt, Sarah. We're not seeing the same kind of trends that some of our competitors have reported regarding severity. Clearly, if you look at our paid severity trends on the bottom right on slide 6, you'll see that there's been some fluctuation; but for the most part, since the beginning of 2015, it's held relatively constant and I'd say in line with inflationary indices. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then on the auto insurance underlying margin, should we expect any uptick in the fourth quarter because of seasonality? Does that tend to be a seasonally worse quarter or would rate increases more than offset that? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah, Sarah. Obviously, we can't give you a forecast for the fourth quarter because we don't do those forecasts. But I would go off a little bit and just say, we're extremely comfortable with 88 to 90 underlying combined ratio being the range we're going to be in, obviously, because we're at 88 flat for first three quarters. What we'll do is in February, when we announce the full-year results, we'll give you a new outlook for next year. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your question please? Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thank you. First question, do you have any early indication from Hurricane Matthew losses? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: No. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: I mean, any indication \u2013 we have no indication we plan to share publicly. We obviously are active out there. We have playing people on the ground doing a bunch of work, Matt said, a bunch of people doing stuff. But we have, as you know, we have a normal monthly cat release where we have catastrophes over $150 million in a quarter, we disclose it to you all. That is \u2013 when is that? It's in two weeks on a Thursday. So \u2013 and because that was an October storm, it would fall into that. So, you should have some indication of what the number would be, if we do a release in two weeks. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Good. We're waiting for that. Your core loss ratio in auto improved quite a bit year-over-year, but it's still much higher than the 60%-80% average in like 2013 and 2014. Is that still the target you want to get back to? And how long could it take? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Well, first, that's the $100 per share question. As I maybe answer it \u2013 and Matt will have some \u2013 I'll give you part of my view and Matt will share with you his. First, we don't really just target the underlying, we target the reported. So, we believe as printed is what you need to shoot for. There's nothing that I see in the value we provide to consumers or in a competitive space that would tell me that we couldn't earn the kind of returns in the auto business that we have earned historically. Nothing has changed in terms of our skills and capabilities other than we've gotten better. So, I think we should be able to earn the kind of economic returns we earned in the past. Matt, you might want to make a comment about target combined ratios. Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah. Hi, it's Matt. The only thing I'd add to what Tom said, because I think he's 100% correct, fundamentally there's nothing that's changed in the overall business that would imply limitations that didn't exist before, regarding our ability to earn appropriate returns. But the way we really manage the business is towards the creation of long-term economic value. And so that's not just targeting a specific combined ratio, whether it's recorded or underlying. It's the combination of earning an appropriate return and being able to grow the business at that appropriate return. And so, we'll optimize around long-term profitable growth in the business. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Then related, at what point are you stepping back on the rate increases, more focusing on the pace of growth? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Kai, I think what Matt said was here's \u2013 let me \u2013 one more layer of detail on that. Until we know what frequency and severity is in the future, we can't really determine when we'll be changing our pricing, right? So, if frequency and severity keeps going up, we'll have to continue to raise our prices, so our customers pay for an appropriate amount of money for both the cost we have and the returns we should get, given our skills, capabilities and the capital we put at risk. To the extent that frequency and severity level out, and we got back to the kind of returns Matt was talking about, then you would see it come down. But, it's really \u2013 until you can predict frequency and severity, you can't really predict future price increases. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks so much for all the answers. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question please? Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, team Allstate. I'm happy to be on this call as a result of pulling almost an all-nighter watching the Cubs on TV last night. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Thank you, Greg. We're excited as well. We decided not to play \"Go Cubs Go\" at the beginning of the call, but there was some pressure to do so. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, I would have been cheering for you, so that would have been good. I wanted to just follow up on some of the commentary on the recorded versus the underlying combined ratio. And I noticed in one of your answers, Tom, you said you wanted to increase the margin back to where it has been historically. And I guess when I'm looking at an 88 underlying combined ratio, considering all the headwinds that you guys have had to deal with, that's a pretty impressive result. And I've always, in the back of my mind, been thinking strategically that as the loss ratio \u2013 the underlying loss ratio began to improve that you would start ramping up expenses again, advertising, etc. Has there been any change in your approach or thinking on that? Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: Greg, it's Matt. Let me try to take that. So, as we shift out of rate taking mode and enhanced focus on profitability and get back to a more balanced approach, it's not just a question of just ramping up expenses for advertising, because that's just one component of what's necessary to get the system growing. So, it's multiple components, it's \"volume\", it's rate competitiveness, which impacts close rates. It's capacity and agencies and it's number of points of presence. And what happens when you're unfortunately taking a fair amount of rate and we have over the last several quarters, is it impacts all of those things. It's not just that you're not advertising, a lot is you're eating up aging capacity or impacting your close rate. It's hard to put on new agencies in that environment and so your number of points of presence tends to stabilize. So, as we get more stable and as we believe we can see frequency and severity stabilize and that puts us in a better position to begin, the growth initiatives, you'll see a whole bunch of things change and one of them might be some additional marketing expense. But it's only a small component and I would say that marketing in and of itself, if you don't have the agent capacity and if your competitiveness isn't there, it's not a very efficient spend. So, we'll consider that among the other levers that are available in the business to work towards long-term profitable growth. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Right, that's sort of two questions, and I think there's \u2013 I want to make sure we're clear on our philosophy on expenses. So, I think some people, as we've gone through this increase in frequency and severity that Matt was talking about, look at the reduction of expenses. So, we just cut expenses so we could make our number. That's not the case. Our philosophy on expenses is not let's do a target P&L number. First, don't spend it if your customers don't want it. Do spend it if your customers do want it. Secondly, Matt talked about this integrated basis. If you're advertising your agencies aren't ready or your competitive position is not right, and it doesn't really make any sense. We really do run it on an integrated basis. And then we also invest for the long-term. So I don't want to \u2013 in 2011, you remember, I think, (41:58) if we may have been $750 million or something like that in net income and we didn't back off a wit on our advertising expense, because we knew we needed to do that to stay competitive for the long-term. So, we will always have things, whether it's advertising, technology, investing, so we try to manage it really on the long-term economics that Matt was talking about. So, it's our philosophy, sometimes when I read some of the reports that have come out, it feels like people think we've got this, you know, we're managing just to get the P&L number and that's not the way to run a business, except we can cut our costs. Matt's got a big program going on a continuous improvement, we're reducing our costs as aggressively as we can, except we need to use that money to invest in something else, we will, because we think it makes sense for us. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's great color. Considering you've held on to your underlying combined ratio target and all the headwinds, it still is a remarkable accomplishment. One other area, and I noticed that you referenced it briefly in your slides, I think slide 3, it just continues to be a considerable amount of oxygen spent on driverless cars and its impact on auto insurance. Can you give us an update on what you're doing with Arity and what your thinking is in this area? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Sure. I'll go up for a second and then I'll come down very quickly to Arity. We think the personal transportation industry is going to change dramatically and we think that's an opportunity for us to do more for our customers. As a reason, it will change dramatically, it's incredibly inefficient. So, we have about $4 trillion tied up in hardware called cars and trucks and stuff like that. We spend about $2 trillion a year in direct costs making that work. Capacity utilization is in the \u2013 even at peak hours is in the 30%, 34% range and there's one person in the car. A 20% improvement in the efficiency of that system would be a 5% increase in household income in America. We think that's going to happen. It's going to take a while to happen because it's an economically dispersed system. Nobody controls all of it, there's lots of different pieces to it. So, it's not just the autonomous car, it's shared vehicle, it's machine-to-machine communication, it's better stoplights. There's a whole bunch of stuff that's going to change in that system. Arity is one of our efforts to take advantage of that. So, Arity is outside the insurance company. It provides services to Allstate and Esurance. These services that the insurance companies get from it, first it gives them the ability to do a more accurate price for our customers, because we know exactly how they drive, where they drive, and when they drive. But, we have a different model than others, we've taken it beyond pricing to include things like improving the driving experience. So adding applications on to our continuous connection to help those customers have a better driving experience, and then also to use that technology for other things. So, there's many other uses, many other ways that value could be created by cars being connected. We can share that value with customers. We can use that value to reduce costs for other people and capture those costs. So, there's really a three-part focus. Better pricing, better services, and additional ways to use a connected car. So Arity is pursuing all three of those. It will do that for our insurance companies, we'll do it for non-insurance companies, and we will also do it for other insurance companies as well. So we think it's a platform where we will all be stronger because we are together without giving up our competitive ability to price with our own data in the marketplace. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Your question please? Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, thanks. I just have a follow-up on some of the process changes. I guess first of all, if you could just elaborate a little bit on the thought process that went into putting those in place. And also, is it possible that those changes could have a positive exogenous impact on frequency going forward? In other words, was the lack of those changes potentially something that maybe caused frequency to spike up in 2015? Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: Ryan, this is Matt. We'll distinguish between process changes that impacted PD and those that impacted BI. If you recall in the last quarter and potentially the quarter before that, I referred to our desire in this environment to capture more and more information regarding the claim and PD, so that we're better able to manage staffing costs and appropriately serve our customers and ensure that the claims machine is ready to deal with and help out customers at this time. So, we began capturing a greater amount of information at first notice of loss, especially on the PD side. And so, we told you at that point, and it continues to hold true, that there is a differential between the gross and the paid. And that we will over-capture information on PD and have some of those claims closed without payment. That's okay as far as we're concerned. We're more interested in effectively managing the system and taking care of customers than anything else. So, if we have to have some dislocation in the numbers, and some volatility in the numbers to do that properly, we'll do that. On the BI side, as John said in the opening comments, this really had to do with just requiring some enhanced documentation for injuries and related medical treatment in our numbers. And so, that does influence the mix, it does influence the cost, it impacts the mix and the timing. It impacts both the frequency and severity. But none of these things impact our overall actual loss trends or our reserving or the P&L. Because as John mentioned, in his opening comments all of these changes and all of this information is factored in, along with our paid trends and all of the other information that we review on a very careful basis in setting our reserve levels and determining our actual loss costs. So, yes, we have some volatility in some of the operational claim statistics that we show you. But no, it doesn't imply any real change in the actual P&L type statistics that we manage the business on, take rate based upon, and report on. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Ryan, it's Tom. Let me \u2013 maybe one other additional angle on it. We're always trying to get better, right? And you see that show up. As Matt points out, I think splitting in those two categories is absolutely right. You will see to the extent \u2013 the way we do our reserving, when we \u2013 if we see it, we book it. And we don't \u2013 but we have to see it. So, as Matt points out, you do see it in PD earlier. So, those claims tend to get resolved in about 90 days. To an extent, we're getting better. And to your extent, you would see it in this stuff. On the BI basis, that takes several years to really get your arms around it. So that tends to be \u2013 it takes much longer to settle those cases. So, whatever we've done in opening practices, as Matt points out, is reflected in our loss costs. And if you look at our reserving practices over a 10 year or 20 year period, we have pretty consistent ability to accurately predict what losses are. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on, I guess, how to think about the re-underwriting of the book, the re-pricing. So, we've seen retention come down. And obviously, we associate that with better margins. But I'm curious \u2013 maybe you guys could talk a little bit about how you make sure that you're getting \u2013 that you're not losing policyholders that are already meeting profitability objectives. In other words, is there may be a way you can quantify for every three drivers you lose, because they don't want to renew at the rate that's appropriate, you maybe lose one because they \u2013 that you wouldn't have wanted to lose? And I'm just curious how much of the loss retention potentially as you guys losing clients that were already meeting profitability at Allstate? Thanks. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Ryan, Matt will give you a specific answer to your question, but I would say we don't want to lose any customers. We just want to get the right price for them. Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: Ryan, it's Matt. So, let me follow up on that. It's a really good question. And I think it's important to remember I've been talking during this entire profit improvement program over the last 18 months about the fact that we, as we've taken rate, tended to take segmented rate. That is, we did not just spread rate along the entire book in any geography, but did it by sub segment, looking at those categories of customers where we were having margin pressure. So, we didn't take the rate in equal doses across an entire book; but in fact broke it down, so that we were applying the rate need to those segments of the business that were most problematic. In some cases, that tended to be newer customers, shopping customers, segments that as we had expanded our books over the last couple of years tend to be more volatile and they shop more often. And so, if we had pressure in that segment and we took rate there, it's not surprising that we had some renewal pressure. But we tried very hard, as Tom said, not to lose any customers, and not to have any impact. But it is an unintended consequence, an expected consequence, whether or not an intended consequence of our need to get margin appropriate. Any time you take rate, you stimulate shopping behavior. And we know that when you stimulate shopping behavior, you are going to lose some segment of those customers. And the same thing will happen to our competitors as they now take rate and begin to disrupt their books as well. We will be the recipient of some of that. And we hope that as we emerge out of \u2013 you will recall, we took a lot of rate in the last quarter in the second quarter, and in some of the larger states, so that is why our number looked particularly large in second quarter. But as that comes down a little bit, we hope to be less disruptive to our customer base. And on a system-wide basis, we hope to get back to a more normalized basis where we're not disrupting customers. It's not good for customers. Obviously, we think they're all better off staying with Allstate, and it's also not good for our agencies who are dealing with that disruption. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks for your answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question please? Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. So, just back to this BI-PD recalibration. Is there any risk in future quarters as you go through a processes change that we've missed something and this is a \u2013 this will lead to whether in your favor or against you favorable or unfavorable development? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Josh, it's Tom. We have a really sophisticated set of processes the way we estimate loss ratio. So, as Matt mentioned, we start with the actual number of claims that get reported. We then go through and say how many are paid, how many are not paid. We do it by state, we do it by risk class, we do it by coverage. We have a whole variety of statistical methods we use to determine what those trend lines look like and where it goes. We do it by year. We do it \u2013 I mean we slice and dice this every way. So, the answer is, we feel very good about the way in which we do it. It's accurate. And I would just say, there's obviously, as you point out, some volatility and some risk. But we try to mitigate that by being thorough. And so, the statistics you see on the bottom of that page are just one of many, many, many statistics we use to determine it. So, we think we're accurate and we'll just continue to adjust it as we go forward, whether that's up or down. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, it looks radical to us because of the limited amount of information we are receiving from your end. Things haven't changed in that radical a way? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: I think that's accurate. Yeah. And there are times when I'm sad that we give you that information, because we do try to be complete transparency, but hopefully it doesn't lead to misinformation as opposed to it's just one of many statistics. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then on asbestos, I'm always surprised when you guys get the flu. Can you talk a little bit \u2013 I've heard the story before. Why you have exposure? Why it's up right now? Why, unlike some of your competitors, we shouldn't think this is really a necessity for it to be an annual event? And I'm modeling forward, should I assume zero in the years going forward? How should I think about it? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Well, I can't tell you what to assume going forward, because we think with the reserves we have up now are accurate for what we will pay out in the future on a discounted basis. So that's... Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That makes sense, of course. But, in terms of, you have indirect exposure. You didn't write those policies. Is that right? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Well, we have two kinds of exposure. We have some indirect, as you point out, which is \u2013 we did reinsurance with other people. We also have some direct exposure. We spend a fair amount of time and the businesses aggressively manage both in terms of the data we have, they collect the information on policies, what we fight on go into (58:14) arbitration. As you know, we have written this stuff now, been 30 years or something, since 1986, 30 years. So, and when we've had our claim practices, our reserving practices benchmarked for their accuracy and effectiveness, we always get high marks on that. So we think we're as good as, in fact, better than the average in industry. You can decide what (58:42). If you look at our history, you would see that occasionally, we do have to put up \u2013 we do look at it in some level of detail every year. I would point out I think the IBNR is like 56% to 60%. Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: 58%. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: 58%, so the incurred but not reported is more than half of the amount that we have up. So, while not a completely accurate statistic, the survival ratio is double-digit in years, depending on that coverage and stuff like that, but it's over 10 years or most of the policies \u2013 most of the coverages. So we feel, you know, it's out there. It's the gift that keeps giving. I can tell you that we used \u2013 environmental used to be much higher and it came way down and asbestos went up. So, because this stuff has been out there for so long and it's likely to be out there for so long. Some of the other trends that are not predictable show up. So, people back off on environmental cleanups and the environmental stuff goes down. If asbestos, they find a new way to go after the sons and daughters of the people who are impacted by asbestos and say they got it by their parents coming home with asbestos on their clothes, that's a new litigation wave and then it goes up. But, we think it's about right and it's not a huge portion of our liabilities on the balance sheet. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for all the detail. John Griek - The Allstate Corp.: Okay, Jonathan, we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly. Our final question then comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Your question please? Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Good morning, Allstate. Did you make it to Progressive Field, Tom? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: I did not make it to Progressive Field last night, because I wanted to be here for you, Bob. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. I'm honored. Telematics, this is an Arity commercial, is it possible that it's already making a big difference for the companies that have it and the ones that don't are seeing worse frequency and severity trends? And how is the launch going for Arity? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Let me see if I can answer your question succinctly. First, it is making a difference for those companies that have it. It's making a difference for us. I don't think that that overrides the overall industry impact of higher frequency and severity. So, I don't think that Telematics will enable you to get around the fact that there are just more miles driven and people get in more accidents when they drive more. So, I don't think that's an answer for why some people's combined ratio did not appear to have moved as much as others. I can only answer what they do. I do think that it is an opportunity for us to further do more sophisticated pricing, for other people to do more sophisticated pricing. If you look back over a long period of time, when we first moved into credit, first moved into more algorithmic pricing for auto insurance has led to more stability in over our returns for the industry. So, I would just point out the fact that many people today are moving their pricing with respect to frequency and severity, because they have the analytics to know it. And so, I think in the long-term, it's just good for stability and lower volatility and auto insurance profitability. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Let me just close by thanking you all \u2013 saying looking forward, we're going to stay focused on our five operating priorities. We try to balance long-term and short-term priorities in a way that enables us to build a sustainable business model that creates values for our customers, our shareholders and all of our stakeholders. So, thank you. And we'll talk to you in the fourth quarter. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program Mr. John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. John Griek : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and welcome everyone to Allstate's fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by our Chairman and CEO, Tom Wilson; Chief Financial Officer, Steve Shebik, and me, we will have a question-and-answer session. Also here are Matt Winter, our President; Don Civgin, the President of Emerging Businesses; Mary Jane Fortin, President of Allstate Financial; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller. In December, we announced that John Dugenske will be joining Allstate as Chief Investment Officer in early 2017. John will join the team next month and will be part of our quarterly earnings calls beginning next quarter. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted the results presentation we will discuss this morning. These documents are available on our website at allstateinvestors.com. We plan to file our 2016, Form 10-K later this month. As noted on the first slide, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2015, the slides, and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in our news release and our investor supplement. We are recording this call, and a replay will be available following its conclusion. And I'll be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas Joseph Wilson : Good morning. Thank you for investing your time to keep up on our progress at Allstate. Let\u2019s start on Slide 2, we delivered excellent results for the year and finished 2016 with another strong quarter as we continue to effectively execute our short-term plans and build on long-term strategies. As a result, Allstate\u2019s well positioned for continued success. Auto profit improvement plans over the last two years have enabled us to begin to withstand growth in 2017, while being able to react further auto loss cost increases. The homeowners business continues to generate attractive returns despite higher catastrophe losses. Investment results for the year was good, but bounced around from quarter-to-quarter reflecting volatile external conditions. At the same time we\u2019re investing growth both with existing businesses and new opportunities. Net income was $811 million for the quarter and $1.76 billion for the year. Operating income was $2.17 per share for the fourth quarter and $4.87 per share for the year. The recorded combined ratio for the year was a touch over 96 and underlying combined ratio was at the favorable end of the range we provided shareholders a year ago. Shareholders received $1.8 billion in cash through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We also welcome the Square Trade into the fold providing shareholders another opportunity for profitable growth. Going to the back to the bottom, total revenues of $9.3 billion for the fourth quarter reflected 2.8% increase in Property-Liability insurance premiums driven by the continued implementation plan and higher performance based investment income. Net income for the fourth quarter was $811 million and operating income was $807 million. Operating income benefited from favorable underlying loss performance in both, auto and homeowners insurance, lower catastrophe losses, favorable prior year reserve releases and strong investment income. The Property-Liability insurance business performed well as a result of the successful execution of the auto profit improvement plan across the three underwritten brands and continued excellent performance in the Allstate brand homeowners and other personal lines insurance. Allstate Financial had a strong quarter with $130 million of operating income as the newer businesses benefitted from the very high investment income from the performance based portfolio. Moving over to the full year columns at the right, the 12 months operating return on equity was 10.4% and that\u2019s down slightly from the prior year, largely reflecting higher catastrophe losses in 2016. Consolidated Policies in Force declined modestly over the year, as strong growth at Allstate Benefits was more than offset by decrease in Property-Liability business. Looking forward to 2017 on Slide 3, we\u2019re in a position to achieve an improved underlying combined ratio and achieve our five operating priorities both of which have both short-term growth and long-term objectives. We expect to build on last year\u2019s insurance margin improvement, resulting in an annual underlying combined ratio between 87 and 89 in 2017. That range is comprised of a number of key assumptions. First, there will be continued improvement in auto insurance profitability as increases in average premiums and filed rates gives the flexibility to deal with increases in the frequency into various auto actions [ph]. Secondly, we assume the homeowners underlying combined ratio would deteriorate slightly from 2016, but this will be well within our target range of profitability. Encompass and Esurance are assumed to stay on track to improve auto profitability. At the same time, we\u2019ll continue to invest in growth across the company. Our priorities for 2017 remain largely consistent with 2016. The first three priorities, better serve our customers, achieve target economic returns on capital and grow the customer base or [indiscernible] and ensure that corporation has multiple paths to profitable long-term growth. In 2017, we expect to grow our customer base with continued positive growth in Allstate Benefits and Esurance, rapid growth in our newly acquired consumer product protection plan business Square Trade and by reducing the number of policy losses under the Allstate and Encompass brands. As you know, we proactively manage $82 billion investment portfolio to achieve the best risk adjusted return overtime. Net investment income is relatively stable with the large fixed income portfolio and then additional income comes from the performance based investment. The total return on the portfolio will be largely dependent on U.S. interest rates and economic growth. Our fifth priority continues to focus on building long-term growth platforms. The Allstate Agencies platform is being strengthened by rolling up the trusted advisor initiative. Esurance will continue to expand in auto and homeowners insurance. Allstate Benefits will continue to leverage its position in a high growth solitary benefits market. Arity will grow both the telematics business and Square Trade will continue to gain new retail partners. Let\u2019s go to Slide 4 to cover property-liability results. Net written premium grew by 2.3% in the fourth quarter and average premium increases were partly offset by a 2.8% decline in policies in forced. Fourth quarter catastrophe losses of 303 million were 15.4% lower than the prior year quarter. Catastrophe losses for the year, however, were nearly $2.6 billion, which was $863 million higher than 2015. The reported combined ratio for property-liability was 89.9 in the fourth quarter of 2016. When we exclude catastrophes in prior-year reserve re-estimates, the underlying combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 87.7, bringing the full year to 87.9. The four customer segments of the property-liability market are shown in the diagram at the bottom of the page. As you know, Allstate is the only company that provides a differentiated value proposition to each of these customer segments. The Allstate brand, which is in the lower left, comprises 90% of premiums written, that serves customers who prefer a branded product and value local relationships. Underlying margin improvement throughout the year of the Allstate brand was driven by the progress made in the auto insurance business. Homeowners insurance and other personal lines continued a strong profitability. Esurance in the lower right serves customers who prefer branded products that are comfortable handling their own insurance needs. The underlying combined ratio for auto insurance improved the year, but it\u2019s above our long-term target with the fourth quarter being somewhat elevated. The homeowners business is growing rapidly. The loss ratio is within expectation. But the underlying profitability was negatively impacted by start-up advertising costs. Encompass in the upper right competes for customers who want local advice and less concerned about brand experience and are served by independent agencies. We remain focused on improvement of returns in executing our profit improvement plan in this spring. Allstate Financial in the upper right serves brand neutral self-served customers and is an aggregator that does not underwrite insurance risk. We\u2019ll cover the results of these underwritten brands in more detail on the subsequent slides. Now, let me turn it over to John. John Griek : Let\u2019s go to Slide 5 to cover the results for Allstate Brand Auto. The recorded combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 95.3, which was 3.3 points below the prior year quarter and benefited from prior year reserve re-estimates. The quarterly underlying loss ratios and combined ratios are shown on the chart on the top left. The underlying combined ratio of 96.1 in the fourth quarter of 2016 improved by 1.5 points compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, driven by a 2.8 point improvement in the underlying loss ratio. This brought our full year underlying combined ratio to 96.4, nearly a 4 point below year end 2015 results. The chart on the top right shows the drivers of the improvement in our underlying combined ratio. Annualized average premium increased to $978 or 7.1%, while underlying loss in expenses increased by 5.5%. This resulted in a favorable gap of $38 comparable to the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, loss trend benefited from favorable current accident year reserve development with 0.7 points. To provide addition insight into our loss trend side coverage, the bottom half of the page shows the paid severity and frequency trends for both property damage and bodily injury. Property damage paid frequency shown by the blue bar continues to show an improving trend. After experiencing elevated levels in the second half of 2014 through the first quarter of 2016, results in the second, third quarter of 2016 were essentially flat and the fourth quarter experienced a decline of 1.2%. Property damage paid severity increased by a modest 1.9% in the quarter and the rate of increases come down throughout 2016. Bodily injury paid frequency decreased 19.2% in the fourth quarter, while paid severity increased by 18.8%. These results are consistent with the trends experienced in the third quarter. Frequency and severity should be looked at in combination to get a sense of the true underlying loss trends. As we discussed in the third quarter call, bodily injury trends reflect payment mix and claim closure patterns that were impacted by changes in claims processes in the second half of 2016. These changes involved requiring enhanced documentation of injuries and related medical treatment and resulted in a reduction in the mix of smaller dollar claims paid. The increases in severity of larger dollar claims are more consistent with medical inflation and we continue to be comfortable with our bodily injury in current severity trends. Slide 6 provides detail on premium and policy growth for Allstate brand auto. The chart on the top left highlights our premium trend. Average premium as shown by the blue bar increased 7% compared to the prior year quarter, a slight deceleration compared to the upward trend beginning in the second quarter of 2015. Average net earned premium shown by the gray line was up 6.8% and continue to increase, reflecting the lag between written and earned premium recognition. Since the end of 2014, auto average premium has increased by over 11% in total. We\u2019ve continued to get approval for higher auto prices where appropriate as part of our comprehensive auto property improvement plan. In the fourth quarter, approved rate increases totaled 1.3% for the Allstate brand, bringing the full year approved rate increases to 7.2%. While our comprehensive auto property improvement plan has improved margins, it\u2019s also reduced growth as we anticipated. New business applications shown on the top right were down 21.9% for the full year. However, we are flat to the prior year quarter. Additionally, auto retention shown on the bottom left was down 0.8 points in the quarter and for the year. The combination of these two factors resulted in a decline of 2.9% in auto policies in 2016. However, both trends have stabilized in the quarter. Slide 7 highlights the continued strength of Allstate brand homeowners. The top part of the page provides detail on our profitability results, showing that we continue to generate attractive returns with the recorded combined ratio of 68.7 in the fourth quarter, benefiting from lower catastrophe losses despite Hurricane Matthew and the Tennessee fires. For the full year, the recorded combined ratio was 83.7, generating an excess of $1 billion in underwriting income. The underlying combined ratio of 59.1 for the quarter and 59.5 for the year continues to reflect strong underlying profitability. While our underlying combined ratio results for the year have been excellent, our long-term target for this line remains in the low 60\u2019s. The bottom half of the page provides detail on our growth trend which follow the auto lines since many of the customers in this segment preferred to bundle their purchases. New business and retention levels declined leading to a 1.2% decline in policies in force. Slide 8 provides a holistic view of our Esurance results. We continue to remain focused on improving auto profitability while investing in product and geographic expansion. The recorded combined ratio of 105 in the fourth quarter was 2 points below the prior year quarter and through the year the Esurance combined ratio was 107.5 lower than the prior year period by 2.8 points driven by lower expenses. The lower expense ratio for the year reflects reduced advertising expense. The underlying loss ratio of 76.3 is higher than long-term target, primarily due to higher auto claim frequency and severity and we will continue to take actions to enhance Esurance returns. Esurance growth trends are highlighted on the bottom of the page. Net written premiums continue to grow on increased rate actions, while policies in force were slightly higher than the prior year end. Slide 9 highlights results for Encompass. Encompass remains focused on improving returns, which continues to adversely impact policy growth trends. The recorded and underlying combined ratios of 90 and 90.7 in the fourth quarter were better than the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year, the underlying combined ratio was 90.3, a 2.3 point improvement compared to prior year. Policies in force declined by 13.4% from the same quarter a year ago, reflecting both continued lower new business and retention. The majority of decline in policies in force was in six states. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve. Steve Shebik : Thanks, John. Turning to Slide 10, Allstate financial premiums and contract charges totaled $574 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 4.9% when compared to the prior year quarter. For the year, premiums and contract charges increased 5.4% as Allstate benefits surpassed $1 billion in premium with an increase of 442,000 policies. Allstate Financial operating income of $130 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $32 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2015. Net and operating income trends by business are shown in the chart at the bottom of the page. Allstate Life net income was $58 million and operating income was $56 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating income was consistent with the prior year quarter and higher premiums and improved mortality were offset by lower net investment income. Allstate Benefits\u2019 net income was $22 million and operating income was $23 million in 2016\u2019s fourth quarter. Operating income was flat to the prior year quarter as higher premiums from policy growth were offset by higher benefits, decamization [ph] and technology related expenses. We expect to make additional investments in technology as this business grows. The $33 million increase in operating income in Allstate Annuity business compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 is a result of higher returns and performance based investments. The chart on the top right highlights the growth in carrying value and in annualized yield for Allstate Financials performance based investments, which primarily back the immediate annuity business. Net investment income of $101 million on these investments in the fourth quarter was very strong and was almost $30 million higher than the average of the preceding seven quarters. We anticipate continued variability given the timing of investment origination and disposition and market condition. Let\u2019s go on to Slide 11 and our investment results. The chart at the upper left shows the shift we made in the risk profile of $81.8 billion investment portfolio. The portfolio remains largely in corporate fixed income securities. To support long-dated liabilities, we are replacing market risk with idiosyncratic risk through an emphasis on ownership over lending. The conservatively positioned high yield portfolio is being used in part as a bridge to fund performance based strategies that will be used as this portfolio increases. Performance based investments now comprise $6 billion or 7% of the portfolio. These assets require higher economic and regulatory capital and we expect them to deliver attractive long-term economic returns for our shareholders. In the upper right, total return for the quarter was a negative 0.7%, reflecting the decline in fixed income investment values due to the post-election increase in interest rates. The full year return was a strong 4.4%. As you can see in the chart, solid investment income from both our market base and performance based portfolios has delivered a consistent contribution to return of approximately 1% each quarter. Net investment income and investment yield by business segment are shown in the bottom two charts. Property-liability investment income reflects interest-bearing yields closer to market yields and the portfolios low to the short duration. Allstate Financials\u2019 investment income and yields reflects portfolio\u2019s longer duration based upon its liability structure, the impact of last year\u2019s immediate annuity portfolio to reposition. Performance based investment results are the primary source of variability income and yields between quarters and you can see the numbers above the chart in the bottom left. Performance based investment returns in the fourth quarter were above our long-term target as we had strong results in the quarter, which included income realization on direct real estate investments and substantial appreciation on our coupons [ph]. Slide 12 illustrates the continued strength of our capital position and highlights our financial flexibility. Shareholders' equity of $20.6 billion at year end, increased $550 million over year end 2015. The debt to capital ratio of 23.6% reflects the issuance of $1.25 billion in senior unsecured debt in December to help fund the acquisition of Square Trade, which closed January 3rd. We have $2.4 billion in deployable holding company asset at year end, which excluded the funds utilized with the Square Trade acquisition. Book value per share of $50.77 increased by 7.2% over year end 2015, primarily due to net income and increased unrealized gains in the investment portfolio, partially offset by capital return to shareholders. We returned $1.8 billion of cash to common shareholders in 2016 with a combination of $486 million in shareholder dividends and the repurchase over 5% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. As of December 31, 2016, it was $691 million remaining on the $1.5 billion repurchase authorization. Now, I\u2019ll ask Jonathan to open up the line for your questions. Operator : Certainly, [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo, your question please. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, guys. Good morning. My first question, what are all the favorable development within your auto book in the quarter and did that come from some of the most recent accident years? John Griek : Steve, do you want to take that? Steve Shebik : So, what we - it\u2019s Steve. The results that we look at, as you know, from our reserving processes is we do a quarterly review, bottoms up. We have - the reserving department reports to me, I\u2019m separate from our business unit and we look, as you indicated, year-by-year we look at virtually every states. We have a very specific program, methodology both mathematically and quantitative, qualitatively as we walk through the results. We look at by line of business. We look at tremendous amount of details. So, the actual results that you are seeing are based on across multiple lines and across multiple of our prior years. You will see in the 10-K that we filed, we have some additional information. It would give you a little more details of the specific years. But quarterly it\u2019s not just like 2015 or \u201814. It goes back to the full year, which is the nature of our business and the length of the tail of our bodily injury type coverage\u2019s in addition to the short tail you might see that we generally would report earlier in the year. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, but some of it should relate I guess to the more recent accident years and we were seeing some of the higher frequency trends like \u201814 and \u201815? Steve Shebik : The frequency shows up immediately, right, because we do it based on count. Some people do target loss ratios. That\u2019s not the way we do most of our reserving. We do it with some lines of business, but what happens is, of course, some people say, well, we think we are going to get 70 loss ratio, so they take 1000 a premium and they book 700 of loss and that\u2019s not the way we do it in our business, because of the short tail nature of it. So, what you see is what you get. There is also a little bit of movement between quarters. So, as we - which doesn\u2019t show up in the triangles in the 10-K but we adjust as we go throughout the year to reflect what we are seeing in the specific year. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you. And then as I think, as we see the frequency trends got a lot better again in the fourth quarter and you guys reported a pretty good improvement within your auto margin and now on the commentary, some of your commentary points that you\u2019re looking kind of to pursue growth, can you just provide some more color. I mean, is this you are looking in certain states I guess that are showing better trends than other or is this broad-based and how do you think about both new business which I did see flattened out in the quarter, new business growth from here as well as just pursuing growth and higher retentions across overall auto book of business? Thomas Joseph Wilson : I\u2019ll make the one overall perspective and then Matt will give you some specifics. I would not interpret this quarter as that was then and this was now. That was going back to where we were. Miles driven were still up to the quarter. People continue to drive more than they have in the past. Accidents tends to be more frequent distracted driving [ph]. I would not want you to take away from the fourth quarter that we are headed back to where we were. Matt can talk about where we are in pricing and we are up almost a $100 for a policy in auto insurance premiums which is quite substantial, which gives us more flexibility to pursue the growth you are talking, but Matt can talk about that. Matthew Winter : Good morning, Elyse. It\u2019s Matt. Let me follow on to Tom\u2019s comments. First, I think about this in three different components. First, the rate environment, the way I would describe it is that we have completed some of the work necessary to kind of catch up to that spike in auto frequency that we saw over the last 18 months and so you saw a fairly dramatic increase in rate taken in order to catch up quickly and try to get that to appropriate margins. And we believe with some exceptions in a few states, but in the vast majority of places we have not caught up and now we are in the mode of keeping up with emerging trends. So, we don\u2019t know what this year will bring or next year, but we are now positioned very well in order to be able to react quickly and to keep up with trends as they emerge. Having caught up, it gives us a little freedom to do something that we were unable to do over the last couple of years. One of which is to begin adding agencies again and points of presence is extremely important for us to enable growth and that point of presence not only agencies but the licensed sales professionals and financial specialists that go along with them, it is hard to do when you are focused intentionally on taking rate and dealing with disruption that causes but now that we are in a slightly more stable environment. We are able to focus on that strategic deployment once again. The second thing that we are hoping to do is to stem the retention losses and declines that we had growth, overall growth in items in four says you know there is a combination of new business growth and retention and it is a vicious treadmill if retention keeps declining since very hard to add enough new business to make up for that loss. We saw slight stabilization in the decline in this last quarter that makes sense to us since we took huge amount of rate in the second quarter of 2016 and so most of that has burned through already in customers and dealt with disruption already. To the extent we are able to keep more moderate rate increases at this point in time we believe customer disruption will be mitigated, will be able to hold on to more customers and I am in this business die. The third component is the competitors environment and well we took fair amount of predecessors and we are questioning for reacting quickly about 18 months ago, I think that has been to our benefit I think most if not all of our competitors and recognized some increased frequency and many chases are reacting only recently from a rate taking perspective. That type of rate taking from our competitors create, shopping behavior in their customers and to the extend we are better positioned, we have increased agency capacity and our agents are ready willing enable to serve those customers, we should be in a very good position to pick up more of those customers from a new business perspective. So it is really a combination of all those items of improving retention, being in a position to capture more new business and hopefully in a more stable rate environment disrupting fewer customers. Elyse Greenspan : Okay great, thank you and then one last quick question. Matthew Winter : Let's go to next question because we got like about 12 people on line here okay. We will come back to you if we have time. Operator : Certainly, thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James, your question please. Greg Peters : Thank you for the call and taking my questions, I will keep it to two questions I guess. This is a follow up Matt; you were talking about agencies and points of presence. I was wondering if you could provide some demographics around your agencies, how many are closed to retirement and should we infer from your comments that you're as because your - you took pricing actions earlier than many of your peers, that your product and price decision should improve throughout 2017 and then I have a one follow up to that. Matthew Winter : Okay Greg, well let me try - I don\u2019t have the actual agency demographics in front of me and I don\u2019t want to go based upon memory but I can tell you that we have over the last several years engaged in a different type of recruiting and selection process for agency owners, both in terms of geographic and in terms of demographic. I think as you know we have historical presence on the coast and that has served us well and we have been able to grow well there. We have not done as well in terms of strategic deployment and some of the heart land states in the lower premium stage and we have a concentrated effort to do that. In terms of the people that we are bringing on, I would say that we've done an what I considered an excellent job of using data analytics and some of the projective tools available to us to better select people who will thrive in our new environment and we talk a little bit about our shift to trusted advisor mode but the type of agency owner and licensed sales professional that would have thrived maybe 10 or 15 years ago will not be the same type of person that we are looking to now because to drive in the next 10 to 15 years. The trusted advisor model is much more relationship and advisory oriented, it is much more technology driven. It requires people who really want to get out there and use data analytics and technology themselves to serve customers to be able to really advise them about the risk that they take on in their lives and how to mitigate those risks. It requires somebody who is to more sophisticated about money management, so that they help our customers manage their cash flows as well as manage their risks. So the type of agency owner we were bringing on and licensed sales professional will bring you on - I feel very confident is one designed for the future and we had a decline in most of 2016. We saw a pickup in the last quarter about 200 licensed sales professional and that is really key for us and when you look at our agencies, we will be shifting - we always had a focus on increasing the number of agencies because we believe physical points of presence are important, but agency capacity is just as important so the number of licensed sales professionals and their specialization, their ability to sell life and retirement, commercial insurance all of the different customer household lines, homeowners, their ability to specialize segment of licensed sales professionals so that they can really focus on serving customers is going to be key and so I think from a demographic perspective we are certainly creating a type of feel towards better way of serving customers in the future. Greg Peters : Thank you. I guess the follow up question to all that, I just go back to the product positioning for 2017, in light of your comments about your early actions on price versus some of your peers, obviously the focus will be going forward for wall street, some of your investors will be growth and improvement in retentions, just to clean up on that, thank you very much for your answers. Matthew Winter : Sure Greg, well first I am going to ask you to resist the natural tendency to think that growth is only a factor of price. Certainly rate and price competitors as a component but it is certainly not all of it and some of things I just talked about with trusting advisor, better serving our customers and better famous process and more focused advisory system, the ability to do enforced reviews and annual reviews on their holdings, that\u2019s all a piece of retention and that\u2019s all a part of growth. But you are correct shopping behavior is typically triggered by price changes and to the extend our competitors are now taking additional rate and fairly significant chunks because they are catching us as we were about 12 to 18 months ago. That will trigger if it is likely to trigger shopping behavior and their customers and if we have already gone through that and are stable I believe we will be better positioned to potentially add some of those customers and begin serving them as all state customers. Greg Peters : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR, your question please. Randy Binner : Hey, thank you. I just want to follow up on the response to Elyse\u2019s question on reserves and so I guess the way, I heard it was that favorable PYD [ph] was primarily from Auto BI over last three to four years and what do you think caused that is it a change in your claims approach that you have mentioned earlier? Is there some other aspect that caused that favorable development? It was notable and it is not really the pattern we've seen from others? Thomas Joseph Wilson : While, I can't speak that what it means with respect to others. It is as you described mostly auto, it is really not a big percentage by the way total reserves and loss cost, when you look there is a normal variation in making the estimate when you are looking out anywhere from two to four years to get claims resolved strictly in BI which tend to stretch out three to four years. There is nothing unusual about we had reserve related much greater than that over time and so I don\u2019t think you should breath anything into it other than we conservatively estimate what we think are our last costs are and to the extend we wind those years up and not as much cash went out as we estimated and it shows that from P&L. Randy Binner : And then the other question is, I appreciate all the commentary about all said being kind of close to loss trend with all the initiatives you have done over last couple of years and that\u2019s clear, the numbers, what\u2019s your sense of what is actually happening out there form a kind of accident frequency perspective, meaning how are accidents still worse are we still seeing distracted driving impact, the frequency of accidents and I will leave there and I have one quick follow up. Matthew Winter : Randy, it is Matt and I will try to answer that. There is loads of data out there about the correlation between miles driven and additional accident frequency but this is also that about increased deaths from increased fatalities, because the seriousness and [indiscernible] and we've talked about and I think we are seeing mounting evidence of the increased influence of distracted driving on that combination and the issue is this. People if we work constantly to that cell phones for many years and so actually cell phone use hasn\u2019t spike up that tremendously but in fact Smartphone ownership in U.S. has spiked up dramatically and when we look at Smartphone ownership statistics and Smartphone use and compare to accident frequency the correlation is great. So when you have increased miles driven due to increased economic driving, lowering gas prices so increase leisure driving. Yeah, the increased number of drivers on the road that means lower margin for error because you used to have maybe 10 cars packed into the space and now you have 15 and so even if there was distraction before you had great reaction time before, now with increased density you don\u2019t have as greatest space to react in and so we are seeing increased accidents. We saw a spike in that, and that\u2019s what we have reacted to so when we say and I think the comment I made a few minutes ago is really important when you said there is a difference between saying things stabilize and saying things will revert to where they were before. We don\u2019t think accident frequency is reverting to where it was in 2012 or 2013 or 2014. What we are saying is the spike is over and it is now stabilized at a new norm and we think at least our belief is and our assumptions for all of our future work is that we are at that new norm and heightened accident frequency due to the greater economic activity, greater density of cars on the road and the greater use of Smartphone\u2019s and distracted driving in the car. Randy Binner : And so then, if that is a new plateaus, it kind of penetration in these cases by the trial bar also at a new high that we should expect to continue? Matthew Winter : I'm sorry, could you say that again? Thomas Joseph Wilson : Trial bar. Matthew Winter : Oh trial bar, so that\u2019s a - I think more of a severity question than a frequency question. Yeah, you have heard some of our competitors talk about combination of medical inflation and the trial bar influence on severity cost. I think to some extend we have seen, we've seen many of those same things but I would like to think we have been doing work on claims management, claims handling for the last several years as we saw those trends emerging. And that led to some of the work that we talked about - that influenced the BI frequency and the BI severity trends that you see that we reported on last quarter. I will remind you that we did have a process change and we talked about that last quarter. We encouraged you then and I will encourage you now to look at the BI frequency and severity in combination because the claimant frequency had led to the increase in severity. We start really high and I will remind you that our number one commitment is always to take customers and claimants what we properly owe them. That being said there is claims management techniques to ferry out and eliminates fraud and wastage that don\u2019t compromise on that promise and that\u2019s what we have done. We began referring some enhanced documentation of entries and related medical treatment to ensure we were paying properly and that did change the mix of claims paid. In 2015, about 3rd of BI claims page were below the $1000, in 2016 that has dropped to about quarter leaving us with fewer but higher severity claims. So that\u2019s what you see a change payment mix, it is still inline when you move all that around and you rationalize the two. We believe it is still in line with medical inflation, we are comfortable with our incurred loss transfer for BI and Steve said in his response to the reserving question. Don\u2019t confuse some of these operational claims statistics with profitability and reserving, when we are setting reserves, when that team is working on the reserves they know about the claims process enhancements, they take the impact of those changes into account when setting reserves, they are doing very sophisticated segmented analysis and so while the claims process changes will influence those statistics you see on page severity and page frequency they are not influencing the reserves. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Macquarie, your question please. Amit Kumar : Thanks and good morning. I'll make this quick, two questions, the first question goes back to I guess Elyse\u2019s question on the trends, when you talk about cashing up to the spike and also address miles driven, distracted driving, the distant fatalities, I am curious why shouldn\u2019t I be nervous that these trends will continue at an elevated levels and hence it is too early to start normalizing pricing, I mean we have just caught up to the past trend but it seems to all the indicators point to continued change in the slope of the loss cause trends? Matthew Winter : Well thank you for that question, so it's Matt again. Look this is what we do, so I don\u2019t mean to be [indiscernible] about it, but we have really talented teams, people monitoring these trends on a stage and sub-geographies, sub-state level whose job is to watch net trends emerging and look at indications and ensure that we are keeping up with them as quickly as possible, consistent with actuarial standards so that you can file toward the rates and convince our state regulated to prove those rates. And this is what we have always done and we think we are well positioned to do it and in fact coming out of a spike like this one of the benefits is always that a benefit of going through something like this, it hyper focused us and those troubling segments of the business and allowed us to take segmented rates on those parts of the business so that we can improve our loss ratios as quickly as possible. So, we believe that we have a high quality book at this point. We believe that we know the segments that we need to keep an eye on or we believe we\u2019ve gotten those headwinds rate adequate at this point. And so, we feel very comfortable with being able to manage some continued inflation and some continued rise in escalation in some of these costs. I will remind you that if we go through that, we will not be going through that alone. Our competitors will be going through the exact same thing and we think that we have an advantage with our skill in reacting quickly. We have an excellent relationship with the state regulators. Our teams have their respect. And so, when we do a filing, it\u2019s a complete thorough filing and we have an extremely high approval ratio and the ability to get rates into the book as quickly as needed. Thomas Joseph Wilson : Amit, this time let me add. So, from our standpoint in pricing, it\u2019s only the now. It\u2019s like we look at what the frequency and severity is. We think - we look at it at that moment. It might be March, April, May, it might be August and whatever it is, we look at the previous [indiscernible]. And so we don\u2019t have a fixed assumption toward the year on frequency and severity that is used in pricing. As Matt\u2019s explaining it\u2019s very organic. So, when you are doing your models, of course, you are looking and saying what\u2019s the frequency and severity assumption looking forward and you have to put something in and then you have to put in something for price. We do that continuously by state, by some piece of the state every day. And so, if frequency is 2 points higher, then we\u2019ll take 2 points more for rate. If it\u2019s 2 points lower, then we will decide whether we think that\u2019s reasonable or not. Unlikely we will lower our rates, but we may choose to invest more in expenses to begin to grow the business and that\u2019s why our range is what it is. With the 87, 89 range we\u2019re completely comfortable with. There is, as you know, obviously a 1 to 2 point variation if you add up frequency and severity over the course of the year. And so, - and to an extent, but we don\u2019t want you to think, so we lowered the range from where it was in 2016. This does not mean that we think you should take 2016 numbers and lower that by the same amount. That\u2019s just not the way we do it. It\u2019s not the way we run the business. Amit Kumar : I guess I\u2019m just a glass half empty kind of guy. The other question I had, and switching topics here, the broader discussion on corporate taxation. If the taxes were to go down, does that get reflected in your pricing actions and I know it\u2019s a hypothetical or should we anticipate that netting down to your bottom line? Thanks. John Griek : Taxes are, of course, complicated thing as it relates to Allstate. The first and probably the biggest impact is when it relates to taxes, that drives economic growth that\u2019s good for the company, because we\u2019re low on U.S. growth and that\u2019s our investment portfolio for the growth in auto and homeowners - auto ownership and home ownership. So, both of those could be very good for us. As it relates to - you\u2019re at one component of it, if you look at our P&L, I\u2019ll go way up now and get back to pricing. We are a full taxpayer. We don\u2019t have - our industry does not have all kinds of special deductions. We think U.S. taxes should be based and corporations should pay based on what they use, not some centralized party control the economy. We know centralized timing doesn\u2019t work and using the tax provided by centralized plan and drive certain industries doesn\u2019t make sense to us. As a result of that, there are a number of industries and companies that pay a lot less tax than us. We think it should be more relieving playing field and so we think our tax pay should be low. That would obviously immediately be good for our earnings, because we would have less cash. We have to pay out every year in taxes. What happens surprising then, it really depends on the individual state you\u2019re in, where you are in pricing that piece. I would make a couple of comments. One, I would reiterate what Matt said. While price is important, we don\u2019t look at price as the only leverage of growth. We think price is what we have to charge relative to the value we provide that Matt is working hard on providing more value rather than just we\u2019ve achieved this in town and then it also depends - there is a variety of other facts, which would rattle through the pricing, the size shift the tax rate used in determining how return on capital and what happens to interest rate, what happens to inflation in that scenario, so there is a whole bunch of other, I would say, secondary and tertiary [indiscernible] pricing. Net, net, I believe a lower tax rate would be good for Allstate in short-term. Amit Kumar : Thanks for the thorough answer and good luck for the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays, your question please. Jay Gelb : Thanks. Good morning. The first question I had was just on expectations for share buybacks in 2017. Should we be thinking about the 2016 page of 1.4 billion as a reasonable run rate? Thomas Joseph Wilson : Well, Jay, it\u2019s Tom. So, I think you should think about - we still have $651 million yet to go, so you can put that in the bank that we fully expect to get it done by the time its authorization is up which is late in 2018 based on the pace we are going, it looks like it will be done sooner than the authorization. And then we look at where we are in terms of capital and we\u2019ll make the same judgment that we make every other year, which is between net and the dividend, how much cash can we return to shareholders, if we don\u2019t have a use for it, we\u2019ll return it. So, share repurchases will continue to be part of what we do, but we don\u2019t have a set number that we are ready to tee up because we still got ways to go on the existing share repurchase program. Jay Gelb : Okay. And then on the Allstate brand auto rate increases, I believe the expectation now is for those rating - the pace of rate increases to moderate in 2017. How much do you think that could slow? Thomas Joseph Wilson : So, how much do you think the pace of rate increases in Allstate brand auto insurance could slow? It\u2019s on the extremely successful 75% you had this year. Sorry, Jay, I was just helping out. Jay Gelb : With the editorial comment, thank you. Matthew Winter : I wish I could tell you. I can only tell you that we\u2019ve done catching up as I stated earlier. So, when you are in catch-up mode, you are sprinting and you are taking as much as you can in order to get rate adequate and to clean up the booking and get to where you are earning in appropriate return on the business and it feels like in about probably three quarters of the states we will be reducing that level of rate we will not be taking the kind of rate we took in 2016. That being said, if we see additional pressure, we are going to take that. So, I keep coming back to the same thing that both Tom and I have said during this call, we do have some assumptions about where loss costs are going to go next year, but they are just that. They are just assumptions and they are not a plan. Our plan is to keep up with loss costs as they emerge and take rate necessarily in order to do that. So, to the extent the reality meets our forecast and we have a stabilization of frequency trends and severity trends where they are now. I will expect us to see moderated rate need as we are keeping up with what is more normal inflationary trends at that point. Jay Gelb : That makes perfect sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JP Morgan, your question please. Sarah DeWitt : Hi, good morning. On the auto insurance margins, just to clarify, are you at your target auto margins on a GAAP basis now or is there still room to improve? And then the reason I ask is because the Allstate brand auto margin would have been 97%, the 2 points of favorable development. Matthew Winter : Yeah, Sarah, thanks for the question. I was hoping Tom would have asked this so we would have asked it differently. - We still have room to improve, I think we feel really good about the progress we have made and we feel like we are earning under appropriate return on our investment at this point, but it is not our target return yet and we will continue to and that\u2019s makeable levers that\u2019s the claims management, that expense sufficiency that is additional rate, additional work on quality as a book, it is correct class work, it\u2019s underwriting work, all of the things that we did really, really strongly to get that to profitability, but all of those levers at the same levels as we need to continue to pull or just - now we can dial them instead of pulling them really hard, we can dial them carefully and thoughtfully to get that targeted returns but a lot closer than we have been for a while to where we wanted to be but our work is not over. Sarah DeWitt : Okay great thanks. And then just on the auto severity, I apologies if I you addressed it but the defect in using, I sense you encouragements are consistent but we heard one of your competitors saying you are seeing much higher severity from more occupants for vehicle, more fatalities, higher legal cost, sounds like you acknowledged some of those but it doesn\u2019t seem like you are seeing any of this in your encouragement and you just clarify that. Steve Shebik : I think you are over reading into what we said about, there are normal inflationary cost embedded in our BI. So I'm not - other people there might they are saying they got lots of stuff in its driving, ours just is normal like and we incur it that way. We show you page, but that\u2019s not the way - we used space to help and think about how we reserve but it is not the way we are trying to P&L. We are trying to P&L on what we think is going to happen using it is normal and it may answered you question on the slight of the longer perspective on the combined ratio so we had great returns in the auto insurance business group, twelve plus year, we showed that the market was going to give us the economic rent based on the value we provided and then in 2015, we had a huge spike in frequency in severity and as Matt said we don\u2019t like, we like to always turn better and so we had to move quickly, our team did, they executed well and we moved those returns up. Are we back to the return we had for that period of time like, no but are we fundamentally different position today, where we feel like what we should be thinking about how we get there or what period time we get there and then whether we can and that\u2019s the process, that\u2019s Allstate brand. Esurance is a slightly different position, it's had a good movement throughout the year picked up mostly in the first half of the year, we are watching the fourth quarter because it bumped up a little bit and if its frequency and severity trends increase, it does the same think that Matt described, it is now, that\u2019s whatever happens. We feel like we have had some good success this year as one of you pointed out, we finally managed to get some underwriting income out of that business and we are happy that now position well and so we got - it is in the same place. We are feeling good about the process and the way the machine works here, they help us manage whatever comes our way and that\u2019s what you are buying. You are buying the machine, not somebody's projection and frequency and severity. Sarah DeWitt : Great thank you. Steve Shebik : Okay maybe we'll take one last question and then we will close. Operator : Certainly, our final question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney, your question please. Bob Glasspiegel : Thanks for squeezing me in Tom, two quickies, on square trade increased disclosure, turning more color on what the goodwill going to be and second to be excluded out of Esurance or included in per earnings? Thomas Joseph Wilson : We just bought it as you know Bob, last month, we don\u2019t have any update on numbers. We are obviously working hard at - coming up with what\u2019s the split between goodwill and intangibles are. I missed your second question. Bob Glasspiegel : Is it going to be included or excluded in core earnings, the good will piece? Thomas Joseph Wilson : The good will, only intangibles are amortized and they are excluded from operating income, that\u2019s definition of operating income. Bob Glasspiegel : Got you, one another quickie, the life earnings were up by more than sort of the partnership delta, Mary Jane was there anything unusual or recurring in that bump up in the earnings level in the quarter? Mary Jane Fortin : So profit financial Bob, really for the annuities, we had the benefit of the format based investments that Steve alluded to that was at 13.8%, we also didn\u2019t have favorable mortality as well in both the annuity business and the life business. So we did have a favorable quarter from a mortality perspective impacting our result. Thomas Joseph Wilson : That\u2019s what she was saying [indiscernible]. Bob Glasspiegel : No, I knew the plump up in partnership income was not recurring but it was more than that, it was 20 million to 30 million more than just increase in partnerships, but mortality could explain some of that, thanks. Mary Jane Fortin : Yeah, most of it was the partnership recurring Bob, the mortality was worked about fixed after tax on the annuity. Bob Glasspiegel : Okay, I will go through it with John, appreciate it. Mary Jane Fortin : Yeah, okay. Thomas Joseph Wilson : Let\u2019s do that. Thank you all for participating if you go to slide 13, there is good reasons as to why this is good investment, why it should continue to hold Allstate, we are positioned with profitable growth and we know how to move in our market place well and we are building long-term growth platforms along the way as well. Thanks so much, we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you Ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Unknown Speaker : fMANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Allstate First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. John Griek - The Allstate Corp.: Well, thank you, Jonathan, and good morning and welcome, everyone, to Allstate's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by our Chairman and CEO, Tom Wilson; Chief Financial Officer, Steve Shebik and me, we will have a question-and-answer session. Also here are Matt Winter, our President; Don Civgin, the President of Emerging Businesses; Mary Jane Fortin, President of Allstate Financial; Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller; and John Dugenske, our new Chief Investment Officer, who joined the team on March 1. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the first quarter and posted the results presentation we will use this morning in conjunction with our prepared remarks. These documents are available on our website at allstateinvestors.com. As noted on the first slide, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2016, the slides and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in our news release or our investor supplement. We are recording this call, and a replay will be available following its conclusion. And, as always, I will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. Now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Well, good morning. Thank you for joining us to stay current on Allstate's operating results. Turning to slide 2, we'll get started. What a strong start in 2017 on both our operating priorities and strategic initiatives. You can see the value of having a broad-based business model that provides a broad set of protection to customers across North America was evident this quarter as we had excellent profitability despite several large hailstorms. Net income was $666 million while operating income per share was $1.64. Auto insurance profitability improved due to the profit improvement actions that were started in 2015 and mild weather in January and February. Homeowners insurance generated an underwriting profit despite significant catastrophe losses. The Property-Liability combined ratio was 93.6 and the underlying combined ratio was 84.8 in the first quarter, below the full year outlook we provided of 87 to 89. Investment results were solid with higher investment income, which also increased Allstate Financial's operating income. We also closed the acquisition of SquareTrade, which expanded the protection products we offer, gives us distribution to major retailers, and added 30 million policies in force. We returned $371 million to shareholders. And as you can see at the bottom of the slide, return on equity on an operating income basis was 11.9% for the last 12 months. If you turn to slide 3, given the continued expansion of our business model, we added two you-are-here charts. So when you're at the mall or in a park and you're trying to get a picture of the entire place, you're looking for those you-are-here maps. Well, slide 3 graphically shows the breadth of our businesses. Allstate's purpose is to protect people from life's uncertainties, and we do this through a wide variety of products and distribution channels. Starting at the center, our customer-focused strategy has resulted in 73 million proprietary policies issued. We also brokered over $2 billion of premium to Allstate agencies and Answer Financial, and we had third-party service relationships with Allstate Roadside, Allstate Dealer Services, and Arity. The second ring shows the breadth of our distribution. The outer ring shows the products we provide with the largest group on the left being the Property-Liability products sold now through the Allstate, Encompass and Esurance brands. The right hand of the oval shows a wide variety of products and services sold through an extensive distribution network. You turn to slide 4 and we carry this concept further to show the relative impact on the overall company. The upper left pie chart identifies the products that comprise the proprietary policies, including the policies we added with SquareTrade. The middle pie chart shows that most of our revenue is still from the traditional Property-Liability products. The table on the right breaks out this quarter's operating income by two major segments : Property-Liability and Allstate Financial. We'll now walk through the components of operating income in greater detail starting with the Property-Liability business. Let's go to slide 5, it shows the Property-Liability results, and starting at the table at the top. Net written premium for the first three months of 2017 was $7.7 billion, which was a 2.8% increase from the prior year. The recorded combined ratio was 93.6, 4.8 points better than the prior-year quarter. When we exclude catastrophes and prior-year reserve re-estimates and, of course, is our underlying combined ratio, for the first quarter, that was 84.8, 2.4 points below the prior year. The four Personal Property-Liability customer segments are shown on the diagram at the bottom of the page. The Allstate brand, which is in the lower left hand, comprises 90% of our premiums written. And that serves customers who prefer branded products and value personal advice and local relationships. The underlying combined ratio was 83.5, with the decrease from the prior year being driven primarily by auto insurance, which had a 90.9 underlying combined ratio, 5 points below the prior year. Given the continued progress made in improving Allstate brand auto margins, we're beginning to invest in expanding distribution and marketing to move back into policy growth mode. Esurance in the lower right shows customers who prefer a branded product, but are comfortable handling their own insurance needs. Our focus is on improving financial results and customer satisfaction. The underlying combined ratio for auto insurance improved and was below 100 in the first quarter. The homeowners business continues to grow rapidly with underlying profitability that reflects start-up costs. Encompass in the upper left competes for customers who want local advice and are less concerned about a branded experience and hence are served by independent agencies. We're focused on improving returns and executing our profit improvement plan in this brand. The underlying auto combined ratio of 97.9 improved 5 points compared to the prior-year quarter. Homeowners underlying profitability still needs to be lower than (07:12) 69.9, given the impact of catastrophes on our quarter results. We'll cover the results of the three underwritten brands in more detail in the subsequent slides. Now let me turn it over to John. John Griek - The Allstate Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Let's go to slide 6 to cover the results for Allstate brand auto. Starting in the upper left graph, the recorded combined ratio for the first quarter was 90.6, which was 8.4 points below the prior-year quarter and benefited from increased average earned premium, lower frequency, 1.8 points of favorable prior-year reserve re-estimates and lower catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 90.9 in the first quarter 2017 improved by 5 points compared to the first quarter 2016, driven by a 5.4-point improvement in the underlying loss ratio. The chart on the top right shows the drivers of this improvement; Annualized average premiums increased 6.7% to $989 compared to the prior year, while underlying loss and expense increased by 1.1%. This resulted in a favorable gap of $90 per policy. To provide additional insight into our loss trends by coverage, the bottom half of the page shows the paid severity and frequency trends for both property damage and bodily injury. Property damage paid frequency, shown by the blue bar, decreased 3.2% in the first quarter 2017 compared to the prior-year quarter. Better-than-expected improvement was observed mainly in January and February as the country broadly experienced milder than normal winter weather. Absolute frequency levels in March were more consistent with the fourth quarter of 2016. Paid frequency trends over the last four quarters have now been flat or declined year-over-year. Property damage paid severity increased by 4.8% in the quarter due to the impact of increased third-party subrogation payments, higher costs to repair new model vehicles, and increased volume of total losses. On the bottom right, bodily injury paid frequency decreased 20.5% in the first quarter, while paid severity increased by 25.1%. These results are consistent with the trends experienced over the last two quarters. Frequency and severity should be looked at in combination to get a sense of the true underlying loss trend. And as we've discussed in the past two quarters, the decline in BI paid frequency and corresponding increase in paid severity was driven by process enhancements related to our claim handling discipline around establishment of liability for BI. These changes involve requiring enhanced documentation of injuries and related medical treatment, and resulted in a reduction in the mix of smaller dollar claims paid. When we adjust for the impact of this BI process change, the increase in BI severity is more consistent with medical inflationary trends, partially offset by improvements in loss cost management. We continue to be comfortable with our bodily injury incurred severity trends. You can see by the inset box in the bottom right graph that the combined impact of frequency and severity since the process change last year has essentially been flat. Slide 7 provides detail on premium and policy growth for Allstate brand auto. Net written premium growth, shown in blue on the top chart, reflects continued average premium increases, stabilizing retention, and improved new business trends, partially offset by a 2.9% decline in policies in force. We are taking a balanced approach to profitable growth and margin improvement by continuing to execute our auto profit improvement plan in markets with returns below target levels, while implementing growth plans in markets that have achieved rate adequacy. Growth investments include expanding distribution capacity and marketing. In the first quarter, approved rate increases totaled 1.7% for the Allstate brand, of which 0.6 points was driven by an improved rate in California. We anticipate the overall magnitude of rate increases to moderate going forward as profitability trends improve. The charts on the bottom of the page show new issued applications and retention for the last three years, along with historical ranges represented by the dashed gray lines. As we implement growth plans, we are beginning to see positive signs of growth with new business applications shown in the bottom left up 4.5% in the first quarter. Auto retention, shown on the bottom right, also has a significant impact on growth and has stabilized over the last few quarters. Slide 8 highlights Allstate brand homeowners. The top part of the page provides detail on our profitability results. The homeowners recorded combined ratio was 93.7 in the first quarter, which generated $107 million in underwriting income despite elevated catastrophes late in the quarter. Over the last 12 months, $1.1 billion of underwriting income has been generated by this product line. The underlying combined ratio of 61.3 continues to reflect strong profitability and is within our long-term target range of the low 60s for this line. The bottom half of the page provides detail on our growth trends. New business and retention levels declined, leading to a 1.4% reduction in policies in force. New business and retention levels in the first quarter are performing near the middle of the historical range shown by the gray lines. Our work to improve auto margins beginning in 2015 has impacted the homeowners line, since many of the customers in this segment prefer to bundle their purchases. The impact of the auto profit improvement actions on homeowners tends to lag auto by a quarter or two because it's a 12-month policy and generally has a different renewal effective date compared to auto. As auto has experienced an improved trajectory in new business trends, we have begun to see moderation in the rate of decline in homeowners new business. Slide 9 highlights Esurance results. Esurance is focused on improving financial results and customer satisfaction. So, the recorded combined ratio of 102.4 in the first quarter shown towards the bottom of the upper left hand table was 3.8 points below the prior-year quarter, driven by lower expenses. The expense ratio decreased 5.9 points for the quarter and reflects reduced advertising, improved customer service efficiency, and a smaller impact from the amortization of intangible assets. Shown in the upper right is the decline in the combined ratio over the last two years. The auto underlying combined ratio, highlighted on the bottom right of the page, was 99.8 in the first quarter, 3.8 points better than the first quarter of 2016. Lower expenses and better frequency and severity trends contributed to the improvement in underlying margins. Esurance growth trends are highlighted on the bottom left of the page. Net written premium continues to grow on increased average premium, while policies in force were flat to the first quarter 2016. Policy growth in homeowners is offsetting the decline in auto policies. New issued applications declined as a result of lower advertising, while auto retention improved by 0.8 points. Going to slide 10 highlights results for Encompass. Encompass results for the first quarter were impacted by elevated catastrophes in March and profit improvement actions that continue to be implemented in states with inadequate returns. The recorded combined ratio was 111.7 and included 23.7 points, or $67 million, of catastrophe losses in the first quarter. Encompass results were significantly impacted by the March 26 hail event in Texas. The auto recorded combined ratio of 100.7 was 5 points better than the prior-year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 86.6 in the first quarter was better than the first quarter of 2016, as profit improvement actions continue to take hold. The decline in premium and policies in force in states with inadequate returns has impacted overall top line trends. And at the same time, we've begun to selectively implement targeted growth plans in states with adequate rate levels. Now I'll turn it over to Steve. Steven E. Shebik - The Allstate Corp.: Thanks, John. Slide 11 covers SquareTrade's results. We acquired SquareTrade for $1.4 billion in January. The first accounting to revalue the balance sheet assigning $486 million to amortizable intangible assets, such as customer relationships and technology, and $1.080 billion to goodwill. On the income side, as a service business, premiums written of $81 million for the quarter reflect the magnitude of product sales, while earned premium of $59 million reflects the recognition of their premium over the approximately 2.5-year average duration of coverage The underwriting loss of $35 million for the quarter is significantly impacted by expenses related to growing the business as well as $23 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. We anticipate amortizing approximately $90 million in 2017. The intangible assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis with approximately 75% expected to be amortized by 2021. As highlighted in the exhibit on the upper right, SquareTrade had a small $16 million dilutive impact to our consolidated operating income in the quarter, including the underwriting loss and debt financing costs. This excludes the amortization of purchased intangibles I mentioned above and $13 million of after-tax one-time transaction costs reported in net income but not operating income. We are developing operating statistics and performance metrics for SquareTrade to help you understand quarterly results, which will be included in the second quarter earnings. Turning to slide 12, Allstate Financial premiums and contract charges totaled $593 million in the first quarter, an increase of 4.8% compared to the prior-year quarter. Operating income of $110 million, an increase of 5.8% over the prior-year quarter, was driven by improved investment returns, partially offset by higher mortality in the life business. Net income of $108 million was $40 million, or 59%, higher than the prior-year quarter due to lower net realized capital losses. Net operating income trends by business are shown in the chart to the bottom of the page. Allstate Life net income of $57 million was flat to the prior year, while operating income of $59 million was $7 million below the first quarter of 2016 as higher mortality was partially offset by higher premiums. Allstate Benefits net and operating income were both $22 million in the first quarter of 2017, with operating income consistent with the prior-year quarter. Premiums and contract charges increased 7.2% compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily related to growth in critical illness, accident and hospital indemnity products. Higher expenses were driven by continued growth and one-time expenses, including guaranty fund assessments. Allstate Annuities recorded operating income of $29 million in the quarter, an increase of $14 million over the first quarter of 2016 due to higher investment spread. Slide 13 provides details of our investment results. We manage the portfolio's risk profile proactively and holistically, considering relevant market conditions and a corporate risk appetite. The chart at the top left shows how we have migrated the portfolio to a more balanced risk and return profile. We reduced the interest rate risk to a lower allocation to investment-grade interest-bearing assets as well as targeting a shorter fixed income duration with the belief that markets weren't providing sufficient compensation for taking interest rate risk. Through our performance-based investing, we're replacing market risk with idiosyncratic risk, emphasizing ownership over lending. These investments now comprise $6.2 billion or 8% of the portfolio, and while they require higher economic and regulatory capital, we expect them to deliver attractive economic returns for our shareholders. Pre-tax yield by business segment are shown at the upper right. The interest-bearing yield reflects a stability of fixed income portfolio earnings, while the total yield includes the variability of performance-based investments across the quarters. The Property-Liability interest-bearing yield is close to market yield and respond quickly to increases in interest rates. Allstate Financial has a higher-yielding, longer duration profile, aligned with its liability structure. Net investment income by strategy is shown in the lower left graph. The portfolio total return is provided in the lower right. Total return for the first quarter was a solid 1.6%, reflecting fixed income price depreciation and credit spread tightening and strong equity market performance. Investment income has delivered a consistent contribution to return of approximately 1% per quarter. Slide 14 highlights the continued strength of our capital position and our financial flexibility. Shareholders' equity of $21.2 billion at quarter-end reflects an increase of $818 million over first quarter 2016. The debt-to-capital ratio of 23.1% is 3 points higher than prior year due to the issuance of $1.25 billion in senior unsecured debt in December 2016 to fund the acquisition of SquareTrade. We also held $2.7 billion in deployable holding company assets at quarter-end. Book value per share of $52.41 increased by 7.2% over first quarter 2016 primarily due to retained income. We returned $371 million in cash to common shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of 3.2 million shares for $249 million and $122 million in shareholders' dividend. At the end of the first quarter, there was $442 million remaining on the $1.5 billion repurchase authorization. Now I'll ask Jonathan to open the line up for your questions. Operator : Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please. Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much. Two hopefully quick questions : one Allstate, one SquareTrade. Let's just say that you guys have the pricing right and everything's good to go. I know you do have Esurance, you have Encompass, but really Allstate brand is the main driver here. What's going to make sure you get the maximized shots on goal? How do you get people into the stores compared to a Progressive that's online or independent agencies? Are you going to have a chance to reach all the possible customers you want to? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Josh, thanks for the question. This is Tom. I'll start and then Matt can talk about the things we're doing to make sure we grow all of our businesses. But first, if you go back to slide 3, it's really about creating shareholder value and improving our long-term strategic position at the same time. So, both today and tomorrow, right? And so, remember, the left-hand side of that, those are the low unit growth markets like auto and home insurance. And our strategy there is to really match value and price. So we have, of course, our trusted advisor initiatives. We're doing the Allstate agencies, Esurance's, raising customer satisfaction and doing more stuff online, more electronically. And in those businesses, once you get done matching value and price, you just have to make sure you're looking at both share of market and share of profits. We manage both of those. We're not interested in taking share and losing money nor are we interested in not having many customers and making a high return. So it's a share of both market and profits. When you look around the higher growth markets like Allstate Benefits, we've had a 9% compound annual growth rate in the business for 17 years running. And we get mid-teens returns in that business. So we, obviously, try to grow quite rapidly there. In the newer emerging markets, things like Arity, our new Roadside model, our SquareTrade, it's really about building a stronger strategic position, which includes both growth and building out our skill and capabilities. Matt, maybe you want to talk specifically about, Josh \u2013 and, Josh, I think you're talking about auto insurance. Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Allstate brand to understanding how it grows. Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah. Hey, Josh, it's Matt. Thanks for the question. I think one of the core fundamental assumptions you have to have is that despite the fact that we have a four-square, I would not describe the four-square quite the way you implied in your question. It's not really pure trade-offs. It's not as if in the lower left, the Allstate brand is not providing technology support for online lead generation or self-service capabilities. It's really our goal in the Allstate brand is to provide many, if not all, of the same tools, capabilities and points of convenience that are available for the lower right quadrants or the upper left quadrant, plus the local advice and service of an Allstate agency owner. So I don't think of it as us naturally limiting ourselves to a sub-segment. We're certainly focused there, because that's where we believe we're focused in the Allstate brand on those people with a bias towards a branded product and local advice and service. But we don't ask them to give up things. We don't ask them to give up the capability for using technology or self-service capabilities. So we believe our growth prospects are quite strong because we believe we're offering something few, if any, are able to do. We're offering quality products at a fair price, good value features and the special expertise of local trusted advisors in the community. Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Well, I realize you have all the fingers in the pie, let's see what happens. Let's talk about SquareTrade a little bit. I'm surprised, my reading \u2013 if I read you right, you're actually taking more underwriting risk at SquareTrade. I thought that was in the distance as you get the capability. Maybe I misunderstood a little bit. To what extent are you going to be making underwriting gains and losses at SquareTrade versus how much you're receiving to partner channels and whatnot? And what's the timeline we should think about in understanding the learning curve for Allstate? Don Civgin - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah. Josh, it's Don Civgin. SquareTrade, since we just closed the transaction, at the moment, they're retaining their existing agreements as far as underwriting the paper and so forth. So we don't have any risk at this point. We do intend to transition to the Allstate taking the risk in the future. I don't want to give you a timeline as to exactly when we're going to do that, but we need to get ourselves lined up to do it. We're working on it and there's no reason that we shouldn't take that risk to Allstate. Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So what does that mean when you cite a combined ratio? What numbers \u2013 is the combined ratio at SquareTrade the entity based on its partners or just the Allstate portion of what's going on? Don Civgin - The Allstate Corp.: It's just the Allstate portion of what's going on. Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And there's premiums coming in, I guess, to Allstate. I guess, I don't understand why, if you guys aren't taking risk, I thought you (28:17) commissions, not necessarily premium volume? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: It's a little confusing. I understand what you're saying. It doesn't sound like a normal combined ratio. Over time, it will start to look more like a normal combined ratio. But as Don pointed out, we, of course, see most of the underwriting risk in a quarter actually to a third-party. We're working on bringing that back in-house. So we will actually and want to underwrite the risk. It will add to our return on capital and add to our profitability. Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, team Allstate. I wanted to come back at you with another question around your competitive positioning. With an 84.8% underlying combined ratio at Allstate and then 90.9% in the Allstate brand auto, do you think you might be getting to a point where you're at a competitive disadvantage from a pricing perspective? Or maybe a better way to ask the question would be is, what's the right long-term target for the underlying combined ratio as we think about it? Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: Hey, Greg, it's Matt. Thanks for your question. So, this is what we spend the vast majority of our time doing, which is trying to ensure that we're walking that fine balance between profitability and long-term growth potential to maximize shareholder value in the long term. And I don't believe that we are placing ourselves at a competitive disadvantage. I think we got out in front of the frequency spike. We reacted quickly. We reacted strongly. And we, in my opinion, have put it, for the most part, behind us. There's, of course, a few geographical exceptions to that. But as a general matter, we believe we've essentially caught up and we are now able to react to and price to emerging trends in frequency and severity as they appear. And we feel very good about that position. We do not believe we overshot the target. We benefited in this quarter from significantly better weather and frequency results in January and February than I think is either sustainable or that was expected. We saw March return to something much more like fourth quarter of 2016. And so, we believe that we are positioned very well. It's all a question now \u2013 when you have a complex decentralized entrepreneurial system as we do, it's now a question of building momentum again for growth within that system. And because it's a complex system, there's a time lag. There's a time lag both ways. But once that momentum gets built, it's a very powerful flywheel. And that's really built through agent confidence in their investment, since it's an entrepreneurial system. And in large part, it's not just the result of how much we invest in marketing and lead generation; it's whether or not the agencies and the agency owners are investing and whether they're adding staff, whether they're putting money in local marketing funds and lead generation. And as they see our competitive position improving, as they see shopping behavior triggered by competitor rate actions, and as they see our rate taking stabilize and moderate, they're in a much stronger position to invest and for us to begin the momentum on the growth side. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Excellent color. Maybe, I guess, slightly technical, but you have reported favorable reserve development in the last couple of quarters. And I'm just curious what the underlying trends are there that are driving that favorable reserve development. Is that a trend that we should expect to continue? Steven E. Shebik - The Allstate Corp.: So, Greg, this is Steve. When we look at the trends of our business, we've talked multiple times about how we set our reserves. We look at a lot of information. And at each quarter-end period, reporting period, we feel that our reserves are appropriately stated. So things change. And as Matt has talked about last year on a number of occasions something called, we call, claims excellence, we're making changes in our claims practices. And over time, that develops and if you look at the reserves that we've been re-estimating in prior periods, a lot of it's just based on what we're seeing in terms of what we've been doing in our underlying practices. So, if you look at the reporting, it's across primarily Allstate brand, property \u2013 probably the (33:30) physical damage coverages have some of the favorable impact as do the injury coverages, which are over a period of time. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So just, Steve (33:38) Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Greg, if you remember, Matt I think mentioned it last time. When we do our claim reserves, we count frequency, we look at how many claims we have, we look at what type of claims. Some people do their reserves based on a targeted loss ratio. They say this book of business we're going to get a 70% and they book to 70% until such time as they see something differently. We do it from the ground-up that gives us a slightly different pattern the way we do it. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Great answers. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Your question, please. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning and congrats on a good quarter. Just first on the guidance. Curious in your thought process why you didn't lower the underlying combined ratio outlook given the 85% this quarter and how much was that result helped by mild weather? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Sarah, thank you for the comment. On the guidance, one quarter does not a year make. We've made this \u2013 that number every year since I started doing it, I don't know, 10 or 11 years ago. We do it so we're going to be in the range. We still think 87 to 89 is good. Matt mentioned that we had pretty good frequency in January and February. We don't expect January and February frequency results to be reflected throughout the entire year. So, we're still comfortable with 87 to 89. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And the mild weather, was that about 1 point, 2 points? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: That kind of variance analysis is almost impossible to do because it, of course, varies by geography, by time of day, and trying to get the weather analysis down to be that specific. That said, if you look at our results and you compare them to the only other real public competitor where you can see monthly results, if you look at Progressive's monthly results, they were down in the 3% to 4% of frequency in January and February and then about a third of that down in March. Our overall results underlying combined ratio was 2 or 3 points better than theirs in total, but our trend looks similar to theirs. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then one of your largest competitor, State Farm, had a big auto underwriting loss in 2016. So, are you seeing any opportunity to take some profitable market share now that you've fixed your auto business? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Well, I think that it's sort of like middlings of (36:22) Josh's and Greg's question. Maybe take Matt's comments, put a \u2013 do a little competitive comparison to it to help (36:31). I think the answer is yes, we think we're positioned to start to grow again, but it takes a while. , Matt mentioned this is \u2013 our proprietary channel is, as Josh pointed out, is most of the business and it's a really powerful channel, man. When you want to get something done, whether that's change your risk profile, get margin initiatives going, you can move that channel because you're in effect completely aligned with them in terms of your business objectives. And that also includes growth. That said, there's somewhat of a lagging growth because, as Matt talked about, that business, it works as a combined system as opposed to \u2013 this is where I can maybe help you see the comparison. If you're an independent agency company, the flow coming through those independent agencies as new business is pretty much the same. Who gets it? It's different. So, if an agency is writing 100 units a month and you've got 20% of them and you decide you're getting 20 a month and then you decide you want less, you get 10. If six months later you decide you want to go back to getting 20%, you can get 20 again. That said, it's a jump hole and you got to fight for that business on largely a price basis. In our system, it takes a little longer to get going and drive their growth up than an independent agency channel. But it's much more sustainable. And you can build a stronger economic value proposition with longer lifetime values. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Your question, please. Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Good morning. The growth comments you made, are they uniform across the distribution systems? Obviously, I know you've already spoken about the Allstate brand business, but what about the growth of the other pieces? Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: It's Matt. I'll start with Encompass and then I'll pass it over to Don for some comments on Esurance. I'd tell you it's similar, although it's delayed. So, first of all, within the Encompass system, we are a smaller system than the Allstate branded system. As a result, it doesn't have the benefits \u2013 the same benefits of scale as the Allstate system. It's more volatile, it's more subject to odd outsized results, both negative and positive, depending upon weather fluctuations and cats. But it also has a 12-month policy, which delays the earn-in rate and the effectiveness of some of the rate actions. So, while I think we started the response to the frequency spike at a similar time within the Encompass channel, it will take longer before they emerge the way that the Allstate brand has emerged. That's not to say we don't see improvement already in certain geographies. It's going through quite nicely. We do have the advantage there, as Tom just talked about, that's an independent agency system. So when we decide to retract or retrench in a state, we can do it pretty quickly. And when we are in a profit challenged state, we can decide to pull back and impact the results fairly significantly and fairly quickly, which we're not able to do quite the same way in an Allstate proprietary channel. So the takeaway is you will see the same dynamics, but there'll be a little more volatility in the Encompass side and it will take about 12 to 18 months longer than it has on the Allstate side. And now I'll pass it over to Don to talk a little bit about Esurance. Don Civgin - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah. Esurance is a little different as well for a variety of different reasons. Obviously, it's a different customer mix, it's a slightly different product. We do our own pricing and we have our own loss trends we watch and so forth. But it's also a direct business, which means in some ways it can react more quickly. We acquired Esurance a little over five years ago. It basically doubled in the first four years. So we know it can grow. And we know the brand particularly with Allstate behind it can work. But having said that, the combined ratio was getting higher. And maybe it wasn't as big a deal when it was only $850 million in premium. But when it doubles, it begins to impact the corporation's results as well. So we decided to focus on achieving more profit \u2013 more GAAP profitability. I think we've said consistently over the years, we run Esurance on an economic basis, so we simply want to make sure that we're writing business that's good over its lifetime. And the accounting convention related to direct businesses where you expense the marketing in the quarter you take it, it creates kind of a discount annuity between GAAP and the economic numbers. So I'm really pleased that they've been able to do that. I know Steve mentioned that they've been focused on achieving profitability and improving the customer experience. They've made great progress on both those fronts. When you look at the combined ratio this last quarter, it's down substantially. And if you look at the trend, not just year-over-year but sequentially, it's down. I like where the underlying loss ratio is. I like what they've done with expenses. But the reality is they only grew 1% in written premium. So we would like to see them return to growth, but with the underpinnings of having the profitability where they want to be. Once they begin to pivot off that, I think it will occur probably faster because it's direct as opposed to going through the agency force and their policies are six-month policies as well. Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : And my second question relates to the distribution expansion that you've talked about as well. If you could just give us some more details about exactly how that's progressing and number of agents and where the distribution is expanding. I assume that you're usually talking about the Allstate branded product when you're talking about this expansion of distribution. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: So, if your question is about the Allstate brand, we can do that. But we, obviously, have distribution through benefit brokers with Allstate Benefits. We do most major retailers now with SquareTrade. We have lots \u2013 made (43:26) thousands of other distribution points, whether it be auto dealers, third-party arrangements we have with telcos and auto companies on Roadside. But \u2013 so I \u2013 zooming in on Allstate. And Matt can talk about that if that's okay. Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Yeah. No, I'm most interested in that. Obviously, I recognize that distribution is broadening out to other places, but I'm most interested in that resumption of the actual distribution growth in the Allstate branded business. Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: Sure. Paul, it's Matt. Well, as you know, we've disclosed in the investor supplement some of the agency data, they're Allstate agencies and licensed sales professionals and Allstate independent agencies. So I'll refer you to page 14 of the investor supp for that data. But let me just give you some color on it. One of the most difficult things to do during a time that you're taking a lot of rate to catch up to a frequency or severity spike is to add new agency owners because they depend exclusively on their ability to put on new business. They don't have an in-force (44:33) to rely on. And as a result, during that period of time from late 2014 through 2015 and the beginning of 2016, it was exceptionally difficult for us to maintain what has been our historical pattern of adding agency owners each and every year, each of them adding licensed sales professionals and also growing exclusive financial specialists to partner with them. And so during that period of time that we were focused on rate, the ability to add the newer agencies was diminished. And so what we focused on there was encouraging our existing agencies to add licensed sales professionals and to open up satellite agencies and branches. But it was difficult to start scratch agencies. What we've been able to do now is to reinvigorate that effort. And that is an effort that I would say is geographically focused, in that it is strategic deployment where we go through a fairly thorough and sophisticated analysis of market potential by geography in order to decide where to place them. But it's so dispersed, I can't tell you it's concentrated in one particular area, other than to say that we try to go where we haven't been before. And so there are vast areas of the United States and even within our existing states areas where we've historically not had Allstate agencies that we are intentionally putting on those Allstate agencies. We've also changed our deployment plans. So new agency owners coming into the system are coming in with three licensed sales professionals as opposed to our historical pattern of one or two. And so, as they come on, they're able to get up to speed faster, they're able to have an impact faster, and we believe they'll be more sustainable. So, it's a fairly significant effort. It is focused on all three prongs : exclusive agents, licensed sales professionals, and exclusive financial specialists. We have a couple of efforts within that to focus on veterans. We have a veterans licensed sales professional hiring initiative where we're partnering with several agencies within Department of Defense in order to provide job opportunities to returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. And we're quite pleased with that, not only because we think it's the right thing to do, but we're adding quality, already licensed sales professionals to our agency force. So, the distribution focus and points of presence focus is an ongoing effort. As we've mentioned, it's a system. It takes a while to get that going. The classes take a while before they're up and running and before they'll have an impact. But we had a great first class in the first quarter, a fairly significant sized group. And the pipeline looks exceptional. We're putting in greater effort on recruiting. We have more assistance from the corporation in recruiting. The human resource area is helping provide it. We're using data analysis and decision sciences to help us recruit and select better. So it's a full-fledged, full force effort on the part of the corporation to improve points of presence. Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. I had another question just to get a little bit more color on how you guys think through the growth that we're going to see on both new business and your retention stabilize and how that could pick up from here. I know when you think back over the past couple of years, a lot of hires in the auto space have kind of grown in to some margin problems, just given the elevated frequency and some companies seeing elevated severity trends. So how do you guys balance this renewed push to growth with the mindset of still looking to reach your margin goals? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Elyse, there's a lot in there. I mean, maybe a little \u2013 overall, we think as the competitors who we follow publicly and then we, of course, follow all the mutuals in terms of their filings and their reciprocals, are increasing their prices, well, some of them quite rapidly. We think that will lead to increased shopping behavior. And Matt can talk about how we're capturing that through both new business and what that also does and then where we are in the pricing cycle, what that does for us on retention. Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Elyse. It's an important issue. I also, though, I want to point out at the outset that for the most part, a lot of our conversations so far this morning on growth has been related to new business. But in fact, the biggest lever we have in total item growth is retention improvement. And when you look back to the timeframe that we were really growing a couple of years ago, retention was about 1 to 1.5 points higher than current levels. And that's very powerful thing at our retention levels and with our size of the in force. So while we've talked a lot about points of presence and lead generation and increased investments in growth on the new business side, I don't want to discount the fact that really one of the most crucial leverage we have is on the retention side where we have a lot of energy and effort to improve the retention, especially first retention in our book, we have a whole new onboarding process. We have a whole lot of work being done, again, with data analytics and emerging technologies to change the onboarding and the initial experience with our new customers to ensure that their initial experience is as strong as possible. And we think that now that we're moderating our rate, we are going to trigger less shopping behavior on our customers and improve retention. At the same time, many of our competitors are still taking fairly outsized levels of rate and triggering shopping behavior on theirs. So, to the extent they're taking higher rate levels than we are, we're moderating ours, we believe that we'll be able to benefit from that and capture some of those customers. The balance with our profitability, we feel, as I've said, really good about it. We believe that our approach to the business, and you can look back over the years; we have a tremendously strong profitability muscle. It's a natural muscle of this organization. If you know the movie The Blind Side, our natural reaction is protect profitability and we do that innately and intensely. That being said, we're excited about our growth possibilities with those newly restored margins. And the final comment I'd make is, remember that this is geography-by-geography and we approach it on a micro basis. So, some of the things I'm talking about are general comments. When you go state-by-state and sub-geography-by-sub-geography, there will be different dynamics. In some areas, we're way ahead of the game and our profitability is fully restored and we have the foot on the gas completely. There are other geographies where we still have a little more work to do and we will maintain our margin discipline before putting the foot on the gas on growth. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Elyse, one other factor is, Matt was talking about our second objective, make sure we achieve the target return on economic capital. Our first corporate objective is better serve our customers. We measure that by Net Promoter Score. And the Net Promoter Score was up in the first quarter. So, just as we overachieved our combined ratio goal for the first quarter, we feel like we overachieved on our Net Promoter Score, which leads to exactly what Matt's talking about, point of retention to point of growth. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's great. And then just tying together some of this commentary. As I look at the Allstate brand auto book and the underlying loss ratio within that, obviously, there was some favorable frequency trends that you pointed to in the Q1. As you think about improving your retention, some new business growth combined with still taking rate on areas of the country that aren't at profitable levels, I mean, do you see the kind of ex favorable frequency underlying loss ratio within that book still continuing to improve from here? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: It's really hard to project what frequency is going to do from here. What we do is just when we see it, we react. I think the point Matt made, which is we're not behind the curve now. We're at where we need to be. So, if things happen, we can adjust in there. You have to do it a little more aggressively if it moves quickly. So, if it was to move like it did in 2015, we might have to go right back to what we did again. If it is more normal and less out of pattern, then the impact on our business would be substantially less than it has been in the last two years. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Al Copersino from Columbia Management. Your question, please. Albert S. Copersino - Columbia Management Investment Advisers LLC : Well, thank you. I certainly appreciate that you guys have improved the claims management process as far as BI goes. I'm looking at slide 6. And Allstate has always been very good at making sure they don't pay claims they're not supposed to pay. One question for you, though, is it possible to get a sense and if you can't do it numerically, maybe more subjectively, is it possible to get a sense as to what these frequency and severity numbers for BI severity on slide 6 would have looked like under the old system? I'm just trying to get a sense if we're at any sort of inflection point or not. Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah. Hi. It's Matt. I think if you look at PD, paid frequency and severity trends, you get a little bit of an insight into overall trends in the business. I remind you that one of the problems with looking at the BI chart on the lower right is that's paid frequency and paid severity, which is a little more volatile. So, it's influenced a little bit more by the mix. You could have one large loss in there that throws it off. So it's not mathematical. You can't just take 25.1% and minus the 20.5% and come up with the answer. You have to do it on a longer-term basis. I'll go back to something that Steve said and that Tom referenced. We feel comfortable that our BI trends, our incurred severity trends are where they should be, based upon medical inflation and all the work we're doing to manage claims cost. We are laser-focused on it, as we should be, to pay the right amount, a fair amount and the amount that the customer or the injured party deserves, but not more and not less. And so, the process enhancements are working. We feel good about them. As Tom mentioned, reserving is not impacted because we take into account in the reserving exercise all of these process changes and operational changes and incurred trends and pay trends. And so, I don't want you to think that the distortion caused by some of our operational excellence things influence our reserving trends. They don't. We're well aware of those and at the time we do the reserving, that's all factored in. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: If you're thinking longer term, right, so there's always this question about with machine-to-machine communication, smart cards, antilock brakes, all the safety stuff, there will probably be fewer accidents in the future. We, of course, didn't see that in the last couple of years. And that you could make the same argument about fewer bodily injury accidents or bodily injuries because of airbags and safety equipment. But we haven't seen any big break there. So there's nothing changing from a long-term standpoint. What Matt is referring to is just the way we count. Albert S. Copersino - Columbia Management Investment Advisers LLC : Well, that's helpful. I appreciate that. I have one other question, if I could, which is, I guess, a bigger picture question. The Allstate captive agency is just a tremendous asset. And as you guys said, you've been very focused on profitability there. You've always taken profitability over growth. At the same time, though, we have other businesses which have been \u2013 I think have been dilutive to your margins, dilutive to returns, whether it's Encompass or Esurance, or now with SquareTrade. And I'm trying to square these two things. Because you have been so disciplined on the Allstate side, but yet we've expanded into other distribution areas to increase the volume that Allstate has available to it, but at the harm of returns and margins. I just wonder if you could talk about that, Tom. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah, I will. So, if you go back to page 3, what you referred to is really the left hand side of the page where we know how to both moderate our market share and our profit share quite effectively. When you start to walk around the top, the life and retirement piece off the top, we get good low teens return on life business, it works well with our agencies, it broadens us, so that's a value-adder. Allstate Benefits, I mentioned, gets mid-teens and is growing quite rapidly. Allstate Annuities is a detractor, as you point out. We'd stop writing that business. In addition, we took an action which hurts ROE but helps long-term shareholder value, but we did it on purpose. And that is so we have some long-dated payout annuities, about $12 billion of them. And really, that's like a pension fund. And so you should be more invested in equity life securities. The capital charges associated with that are substantially higher than it would be by having fixed income, even though economically it is absolutely the right thing to do. So we decided to take the ROE hit and increase shareholder value. When you look at our actuarial stuff, assuming it all pans out, that was a good move. So that one, the Allstate Annuities, is a drag on it. When you look at Roadside, we have a new fulfillment model. We get about 5 million claims a year. We've improved the average time of arrival by about 30% with our new fulfillment model. And it is about $400 million business in revenues. If you were to put that business outside the company, it would have higher value. I believe people would look at it and think it's a fabulous business. You might say, well, why don't you get rid of it? Because it's really linked to Arity, which is down below, which is our connected car business. And that's a place where we're building a strategic platform so that we can leverage our position on the left-hand side with our customers to really both improve their business with Arity, do better pricing, give more effective Roadside Service, but also maybe offer that to other people. Dealer Services is a business whose profit has gone down. It's a relatively small piece. And then SquareTrade, of course, we bought and we said it is dilutive, but we think broadening our product portfolio to include computers and TVs and cell phones makes a lot of sense to us and the broader distribution through all the major retailers offers lots of growth potential. So it's about balancing overall growth and we try to do that both with individual things. We hold each of them through their own individual standards. So, Don said we backed up on Encompass \u2013 on Esurance. We're going to keep growing Esurance, but we decided it has to be economically viable. We apply that same logic to all the businesses, but with the goal of making sure we build a broad-based strategic platform that can weather all kinds of changes. Albert S. Copersino - Columbia Management Investment Advisers LLC : Okay. Thanks, Tom. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your question, please. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: And this should be our last call or comment \u2013 or question, Jonathan. So, Jay, shoot away. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. I'll try to make it a good one. Going back to catastrophe losses in the quarter, it's the worse catastrophe quarter for the U.S. insurance industry in at least 20 years. And I think it's worth noting that a 10-point impact on Allstate's combined ratio is obviously manageable within the scope of that damage. Can you talk a little bit about what the company's done either from a policy term standpoint or broader risk management that kept the impact of those catastrophes on Allstate's results in check? Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah. Jay, it's Matt. Well, we don't like a 9.8% combined ratio impact, but it could have been a lot worse. We spent a tremendous amount of time working on PML optimization, PML, probable maximum loss work, and risk concentration work to try to spread out and diversify our risk. We use our economic capital model in a fairly sophisticated manner to ensure we are earning appropriate returns based upon the risk in those specific geographies so that when something like this happens, we feel okay about it and we can focus where we should be focused, which is on serving our customers and helping restore them back to normal. I would point out, unfortunately, in an organization like Encompass, which doesn't have the scale benefits and as a result, the diversification benefits, that hailstorm and the catastrophe in March had a greater impact on \u2013 proportional impact on Encompass than it did on Allstate brand despite the fact that we've done great work there over the last several years to reduce the risk concentration. But nevertheless, when you have a smaller business like that, it's just not as diversified, which is why we have a two-part program going on right now in Encompass, which is to retrench from those states in which we're not earning an appropriate return and grow in other states where we believe that we can earn an appropriate return and, therefore, diversify our risk. Within the Allstate brand, we do, as I say, lots of offsetting work and offsetting trades. It's interesting that you can add some homes on Long Island and therefore be able to grow a little bit in Harris County. You're seen announcements that we're doing limited selective homeowners writing again in California and Florida, and that's because our diversification work and PML work has been successful and we feel that those additional added items will actually be helpful to our diversification and not pose undue risk. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Okay. Well, looking forward, we're going to stay as focused on those five operating priorities for 2017, make sure we're balancing the short term and the long term in a way that enables us to create value for our customers, our shareholders, and all of our stakeholders. So, thank you. We'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. John Griek : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome, everyone, to Allstate's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by our Chairman and CEO, Tom Wilson; Chief Financial Officer, Steve Shebik and me, we will have a question-and-answer session. Also here are Matt Winter, our President; Don Civgin, the President of Emerging Businesses; John Dugenske, our new Chief Investment Officer; Mary Jane Fortin, President of Allstate Financial; and Eric Ferren our Corporate Controller. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the second quarter and posted the results presentation we will use this morning in conjunction with our prepared remarks. These documents are available on our website at allstateinvestors.com. As noted on the first slide, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2016, the slides and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in our news release or our investor supplement. We are recording this call, and a replay will be available following its conclusion. And, as always, I will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. Now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Well, good morning. Thank you as always for taking your time and investing with us and to understand the progress we\u2019re making at Allstate. So let\u2019s begin on Slide 2. Allstate delivered strong financial results in the second quarter. Net income was $550 million or $1.49 per share in the second quarter of 2017 and that is in comparison to $242 million last year really reflects improved auto insurance margins and strong investment results from our performance base strategy. Operating income per share was $1.38 in the quarter. The improvement in auto insurance profitability is a result of us rapidly reacting to higher loss costs beginning in 2015 and it was aided by declining frequency in the first half of 2017. Investment income on our $81 billion portfolio also increased in prior year, as stable earnings from the quarter, market base fixed income portfolio was supplemented with higher results from the performance base portfolio. Operating income return on equity was 30.5% as you can see at the bottom of the table, a significant improvement over last year. Go to Slide 3 which shows our operating priorities for 2017. We made excellent progress on the five operating priorities, but not all of this is yet impacted reported financial results. The first goal is to better serve customer and we measure customer satisfaction by a net promoter score and an increase for most of our businesses although this is not let yet led to higher policy retention. We do expect higher customer satisfaction to translate into higher growth particularly as insurance auto price increase is moderate. Allstate manages shareholder capital to deliver attractive returns which acquire us to achieve target economic returns on capital. As you can see from our results, we are excelling in this priority. Auto insurance margins have improved, reflecting the broad-based profit improvement plans initiated over two years ago. Profitability also benefited from lower frequency of accidents reflecting both our profit improvement plan and overall flattening in market. The reported auto insurance combined ratio for all brands was 96.6 for the quarter and 95.8 for the Allstate brand. Auto insurance combined ratio for the first six months of the year was 94.1 or 6.5 below the prior year. The primary driver of difference was an increase and that led to over $700 million in underwriting profit difference between these first two quarters in the first two quarters of last year. The homeowners insurance plan was also profitable in the quarter led by Allstate brand which had a combined ratio of 97.2 despite $650 million of catastrophe losses. The property liability recorded combined ratio was 97.2 and the underlying combined ratio was 85.5 in the second quarter. Through the first half of the year, our underlying combined ratio was 85.1, assuming current loss trends continue, we expect to end 2017 at or below the low end of our annual outlook range of 87-89. Allstate Financial operating income increased to $153 million is a strategy to increase performance base investments to the annuity business generated good results. Long-term value creation also requires growth in the customer base. The acquisition of SquareTrade in January was added over 31 million policies and Steve will cover our key priorities with SquareTrade in a few minutes. Allstate Benefits continues with 17 year track record of growth and policies in force exceed 4 million. The Allstate brand is now accelerating the trusted advisor initiative to raise growth by delivering a better value proposition as a local advice and branded product customer segment.  A large component of operating income is results from investment income so despite the continuation of historically low interest rates, we\u2019ve done quite well there as well. The portfolio is proactively managed and is primarily a high quality fixed income portfolio which generates predictable earnings with modest growth. The value of the market base portfolio is increased this quarter due to reduction in corporate bond yields and higher equity values. The performance base portfolio had a great quarter with strong growth in private equity and real estate earnings. We focus on delivering current results while investing for long-term growth. In addition to the trusted advice initiative, we have growth plans for Allstate Benefits, SquareTrade, Allstate Roadside and Esurance. We're also investing in building connected car platform at Arity, which is continued to enhance its capabilities in telematics, data, analytics and customer service. Slide 4 provides an overview of our capital strength and financial flexibility. As you can see from the back to the top, we delivered excellent returns, increased book value, maintained a conservative financial position while increasing shareholders ownership in the Company by reducing the number of outstanding shares. We've returned $903 million to shareholders for the first six months to the year that includes repurchasing 7.9 million shares of our common stock or 2.1% of those outstanding at the beginning of the year. Yesterday, we authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program that will begin following the completion of our current 1.5 billion program. Our intention is to fund its new program through a combination of deployable capital, operating cash flow and a potential issuance of preferred shares. Now, let me turn it back to John. John Griek : Thanks, Tom. Slide 5 shows property liability results by customers segment and brand. Starting with the table at the top, net written premium was $8.3 billion which was a 3% increase from the prior year and the recorded combined ratio of 97.2 was 3.6 points better than the prior year quarter. When we exclude catastrophes and prior year reserve re-estimates, the underlying combined ratio for the second quarter was 85.5, 3.1 points better than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio for the second quarter includes 0.6 points or $52 million of restructuring expenses primarily related to the expansion of QuickFoto Claim, our virtual estimating platform. This expansion resulted in improved efficiencies and the closure of a number of claims drive in offices. As you know, our strategy is to provide different customer value prepositions for the four consumer segments of the property liability market. The Allstate brand in the lower left competes with the local advice and branded segments. We're the most prominent competitors of State Farm, Nationwide and Farmers. Obviously, GEICO and Progressive target these customers as well, but do not offer the same value preposition provided by our 10,400 Allstate agencies. This segment comprises 90% of our total premiums written. The underlying combined ratio was 84.4 with the favorable prior year comparison being driven by improving loss trends in auto insurance, which had a 92.8 underlying combined ratio, 5 points below the prior year. Net written premium was 2.3% higher in the second quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year quarter due to a 3.3% increase in auto. Esurance in the lower right serves the customers who prefer branded product, but are comfortable handling their insurance needs. GEICO and Progressive Direct have a larger share of this segment than their overall market share. We continue to focus on improving the auto loss ratio, raising customer satisfaction and rapidly growing homeowners policies in force. The combination of these initiatives will support long-term growth. The underlying combined ratio for auto insurance improves slightly and was below 100 for the second consecutive quarter. The homeowners business continues to grow rapidly with underlying profitability that reflects start-up cost. The underlying combined ratio of 125 in the second quarter of 2017 was significantly better than the prior year quarter as homeowners marketing spend was reduced.  Encompass, in the upper left competes for customers who want local advice are less concerned about a branded experience and are served by independent agencies. We are making good progress in improving underlying margins, but the business has gotten smaller as we exit on profitable markets and raise prices. As we achieve rate adequacy, we will initiate growth plan on a targeted basis in this segment. Let\u2019s go to Slide 6 to cover the results for Allstate brand auto insurance in more detail. Starting with the top left graph, the recorded combined ratio for the second quarter was 95.8 which was 5.4 point below the prior year quarter and benefited from increased average return premium, lower frequency and favorable prior year reserve re-estimates primarily related to entry coverages. The underlying combined ratio of 92.8 in the second quarter of 2017 improved by 5 point compared to the second quarter of 2016, driven by a 5.7 point improvement in the underlying loss ratio. The chart on the top right shows the results of the broad-based profit improvement plan initiate in 2015. Annualized average premium shown by the blue line increased 5.6% to $999 compared to the prior year, while underlying loss and expense shown by the red line was nearly flat. This resulted in a favorable GAAP of $72 per policy compared to the mid-teens in the second quarter of 2015. While we continue to selectively file rate increases to keep pace with loss trends, the overall magnitude of rates taking will moderate, if the gap between the red and blue line is maintained.  Gross frequency trends for bodily injury and property damage coverage are shown on the bottom chart. Frequency continued to show improvement across both coverages in the second quarter of 2017 and favorable trends were geographically widespread. The lower frequency in 2017 reflects good weather in the first quarter, the benefits of the auto insurance profit improvement plan and moderating frequency trends across the industry. Slide 7 shows the underlying drivers of policies in force for Allstate branded auto insurance. As you can see from the graph at the top, overall policy counts have flattened down on a sequential quarter basis. This reflects an increase in new issued application and a steady renewal ratio. We are beginning to accelerate the components of the trusted advisor initiative while expanding Allstate branded distribution with the objective of policies in force. This should be supported by fewer required price increases now that auto margins have improved. Slide 8 shows similar information for Allstate branded homeowners which has had consistent profitability and is also being positioned for growth. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve. Steve Shebik : Thanks, John. Let\u2019s go to Slide 9 and our investment results. Overall, investment results have been strong this year, reflecting favorable market condition and the asset allocation decision to increase performance base investments, which reflect the 10 year history of increasing commitments and building our capabilities. Today, we utilize third-party managers, co-investments through additional partnerships and our own direct investing and have created a broad portfolio of diversified investments. Total return in the upper left graph was 1.8% for the quarter, as our strategic positioning coupled with favorable market conditions, show strong results across our diversified portfolio. Investment income shown in the blue has consistently contributed approximately 1% of return per quarter with stable earnings from our market base portfolio of primarily investment grade fixed income investments. Total return varies based on the portfolio value at the end of each quarter as reflected by the valuation component shown in grey. As you can see the value of the portfolio increased in second quarter primarily due to lower corporate bond yields and higher equity prices. The Property-Liability bond portfolio which totaled $32 billion is concentrated in three to five year maturities. If interest rates rise, bond valuations will be negatively impacted however net investment income will increase over time. Net investment income in total and for the market based and performance based portfolios is shown in the upper right graph. Net investment income for the second quarter was $897 million, $135 million higher than second quarter of 2016. This increase was driven primarily by performance based investment income of $263 million. While performance based income is variable from quarter-to-quarter. Long term returns for Allstate have been attractive as shown by the bottom two graphs. The quarterly impact of performance based net income has averaged $155 million over the last 10 quarters and is largely driven by private equity and real estate investment. The table beneath the chart on the bottom left shows the increase in maturing value of performance based portfolio overtime. Our performance based portfolio has generated attractive long-term economic returns as shown in the bottom right. Internal rates of return are generally over 10%. The recent downturn in the 10 year measure reflects high valuations just prior to the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. Turning to Slide 10, Allstate Financial had a substantial increase in profitability as a result of the performance based investment results. Premiums and contract charges totaled $591 million in the second quarter, an increase of 4.8% compared to prior year quarter. Operating income of $153 million increased by 27.5% over the prior year quarter. Life insurance net income of $60 million and operating income of $63 million were both $1 million below prior year, as higher contract benefits and expenses were partially offset by higher premium and net investment income. Allstate Benefits net and operating income were both $25 million in the second quarter of 2017. Operating income $4 million below the prior year quarter, as higher revenue was more than offset by increased contract benefits and investments in growth. Premiums and contract charges increased 7.2% compared the prior year quarter, primarily related to growth in hospital indemnity, critical illness, short-term disability and accident products. Annuities operating income of $65 million in the quarter was an increase of $38 million compared to the prior year, reflecting the continued benefit from our performance based investment strategy. You remember we increased the amount of performance based assets in this business to match the long duration of liabilities. This should generate increased shareholder value, but does require us to utilize more capital in the business and lower interest income both of which suppress short-term returns on capital. Slide 11 provides detail on SquareTrade. Last quarter, we indicated additional disclosures which we provided regarding this recently acquired business. SquareTrade has three primary objectives. First, to increase and broaden Allstate's customer relationships, this will be accomplished through the existing model of selling through store based and online retailers, leveraging AllState's other market facing businesses and entering new markets either from a product or geographic perspective. Second, SquareTrade is growing rapidly by utilizing innovative customer service approaches to reinvent a traditional product offering and it'll continue to utilize this capability to enhance this competitive position. Third, as all of our businesses seek to do, SquareTrade will earn attractive returns on capital. We evaluate this by looking at long-term cash flows. For high growth businesses such as SquareTrade, we use shorter term measures such operating profit to ensure we are on pace to meet our long-term objectives, but are willing to continue investing in growth even if it reduces near-term profitability. Moving to second quarter results as shown on the bottom hand of the page. SquareTrade has solid growth primarily through the U.S. retail channel with policies in force increasing by 1.4 million from the first quarter to a total of 31.3 million, as shown in the graph in the bottom left. Over those last 12 months policies in force have grown by 28%. Premiums written in the second quarter of $85 million in both of the magnitude of product sales, while earned premium of $70 million reflects a recognition of that premium over the approximate three year average duration of coverage. Underwriting loss total $22 million in the second quarter, reflecting $23 million of amortization of purchases intangible assets related to the acquisition. Operating income which excludes the amortization of purchase intangible assets was positive in the second quarter, totaling $1 million. We also included a new non-GAAP measure this quarter adjusted operating income to provide a run rate view of the business. This factor excludes purchase accounting adjustments made to recognize the acquired assets and liabilities as their fair value. During the second quarter, we executed a 100% quarter share reinsurance agreement with our largest third-party insurer. As results, reduced the premium paid to that third-party insurer which will increase underwriting income. Additionally, Allstate assumed approximately $200 million in funds, held in trust for potential future claim payments. Invested income on these funds will be earned by SquareTrade, in conjunction with this agreement, claims and claims expense benefitted by a $6 million pretax favorable adjustment for loss experience. Slide 12 provides an overview of a new reporting structure will expand our financial reporting segments from four to seven. We plan to adapt the new reporting structure in the fourth quarter. This instruction will provide enhanced transparency and operating valuation of our businesses grouped by like attributes. Allstate Protection will continue to include the traditional property liability businesses that address the four segments of the consumer property liability market Allstate, Esurance, Encompass and Answer Financial. A service business segment will include operations that have a larger portion of earnings from services for generally have less underwriting risks. This is likely to include SquareTrade, Arity, Allstate Roadside, Allstate Dealer Services. Allstate Financial will be split in three segments. As you know, we'll substantially reduce the breadth and size of Allstate Financial over the last decade. Allstate Life sells life insurance to Allstate agencies and support of the trusted advisor strategy to broaden customer relationships. This business earns a low double-digit return. Allstate Benefits with a high growth in mid-to-high-teens return business. So breaking these results out will highlight its value creation. Allstate Financials does not sell proprietary annuity given our view on economic returns. So the annuity is really a closed block of business. Returns are low in part reflecting current lower interest rates, in addition as we discussed decision to maximize shareholder value by increasing allocation to perform its based investments that had an additional negative impact on near-term return on capital. This new segmentation will have an impact on goodwill impairment testing and the irrigation of the Allstate Financial reserves with efficiency testing. More information is available in the Form-10Q, and we will provide additional detail later this year.  Now, I\u2019ll ask Jonathan to open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question please. Greg Peters : I just wanted to circle back -- I have asked this of you before, but now that you have had two quarters in a row where your underlying combined ratio is certainly trending better than expected, I'm curious about your view of competitive positioning in the marketplace, especially when I think we've seen some anecdotal stories or situations where some of your peers have started to cut some pricing. Tom Wilson : Greg, this is Tom. I\u2019ll start and then Matt can jump in. First, we do think we were out early and taking the price increases that were necessary in auto insurance and that has put us in a position to not have -- assuming these trends continue. We don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have to raise prices as much which obviously helps because price is a large component that which we compete on. It\u2019s not the only thing we can compete on, however, so there is a wide variety of ways in which we compete with other people. The other part is it largely depends what other companies do, so it\u2019s -- and it\u2019s hard for -- it's impossible for us to predict what they'll do. So some of the large mutuals which have significant underwriting losses may choose to stay there and then it will have really won\u2019t be any competitive window for us to grab more shares from those specific competitors. Some of our other competitors choose to subsidize various state run losses there by having lower prices -- higher margins in other states. So, I would say, we prefer to be on this end of the equation having improved our profitability. So we\u2019re in a balance position to grow, but I don\u2019t think you can automatically assume that because other people didn\u2019t follow us, that they will follow us or that this is sort of open to buy and it's easy to take business. Matt, you may have some more specific comments. Matt Winter : Sure. Thanks, Greg, and it\u2019s Matt. First, it all varies based up geographies, so we\u2019ll start there. On the countrywide basis as I said last quarter, we feel good that we have essentially caught up the loss trends and are now within a more reactive mode where we\u2019re monitoring loss trends and keeping pace with them. But that of course has some variability state-by-state, there are some states where we still have indications and we still need to take some rate. And there are others where we\u2019re doing quite well and things have stabilized.  Overall, we feel really good about our competitive position. In our business with our distribution model, one of the most important things for them is stability and so as we\u2019re stable, as we maintained more normalized adjustments to rate and more inflationary rate adjustments, as we\u2019re able to build multi-month and multi-year marketing plans and give them predictability, they are more willing to invest, they\u2019re able to do long-term business plans. And we see increased quota activity and increased closing rates, and as a result increased new business production. So, we actually feel quite good about our competitive position, it's interesting that you point to rate deductions that you've seen. We still see lots of our competitors with very large indications that are not yet taken all of their indications in some states, and others they're still taking double-digit rates. So, we're seeing it all over the board while we are for the most part very stable in taking modest rate increases, which we believe is very good for our business model. Greg Peters : As a follow-up, with frequency, both BI and property, being favorable for you in the last two quarters I believe. Is there anything going on in the environment that might lead us to believe that that's going to continue? Matt Winter : Boy, if I could predict the future, Greg, I'd be a very man and Tom will be happier too. What we've seen is a moderation in frequency the first half of this year, as we closed out last year, it was really unclear what frequency would look like, we were as you know monitoring miles driven, monitoring the unemployment rate, monitoring cash prices, and monitoring all those things that fed into miles driven, which fed into in addition to distracted driving fed in tax within frequency. And we've seen some moderation there which has been good for our business, these first two quarter. And we have no way really projecting what is going to look like for the remainder of the year. We feel as I said, good about the fact that it appears not to be making step function changes that is, it appears to be moving in a more normalized basis up and down, normal variability with weather and things like that, which is much easier for us to react to and monitor and take appropriate rates for. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JP Morgan. Your question please. Sarah DeWitt : As you begin to transition to growth, should we expect the underlying combined ratio to stay around these levels or should we start to see it rise a bit given maybe a new business penalty or less price action? Tom Wilson : When we manage overall profitability, we obviously look at the underlying combined ratio and it's lower than we expected this year, obviously. We also looked at the reported combined ratio and factor in cats and everything else. And we kind of like where we're at. Could it drift up? Sure, frequency and severity typically bounce around by more than a 1% a year. So, it's a move around, but you said, do we have an objective to further reduce it from here? The answer would be no. Might it go lower? It all depends what happens in the market, but we don't -- we really try to prioritize and balance between maintaining that combined ratio and growth. Obviously, when 2015, frequency and severity went up faster than we had factored into our pricing, we had to prioritize profitability over growth. I would say we're back to a more normal position today. Matt, anything you want to add? Matt Winter : Yes, let me just add. This is Matt. Let me add just two items for you. You mentioned the new business penalty and whether or not, as we begin growing whether or not that could influence the combined ratio. Certainly, the new business penalty is fact of life that as you grow fast, the newer businesses not yet tenured, they tend to have a higher loss ratio than the more tenured business. One of these things, however, that mitigates against that is that in our reaction to the frequency spreads in the last two years, we took very segmented rate actions, and we took segmented rate actions against those worst performing segments of the book. As a result, the quality of our book increased that led to more defections from the worst performing segments. It also led to us adding few or new customers from those lower performing segments. So, we believe that the new business penalty will be dampened as we add on assuming that we maintain the same high quality, we\u2019ve been seeing lately. So I don\u2019t expect that to be a significant drag. The other things I would point out is that there has been some commentary about whether or not this will cause us to dramatically increase marketing spend to stimulate growth, and really the marketing spend is not the primary driver on the growth right now, as we've discussed many-many times. Retention was actually a bigger influence for us than the new business on our total items in force. And so, we are just as focused on, I am trying to improve our retention within those balance of what we can control, since a lot of it is uncontrollable since it's based upon competitor actions. But for those things that we can influence, such as customer satisfaction and customer engagements and stability of pricing, we're just as focused on the retention component as we are on new business. Sarah DeWitt : And then secondly, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your QuickFoto Claim and other claims initiatives and how we should think about the potential for savings there, as well as if there should be further restructuring cost? I think your LAE ratio is running around 11 points, but would it be fair to say maybe over time you could shave a couple points off of that? Matt Winter : Sure, it's Matt again. So let me just start high first. So, we've talked about integrated digital enterprise and emerging technologies, one of those areas that we are deploying it initially and in quite some force is the claims area. We believe it's an area of primed for it because there it is some inefficiency in the way the model operated. In the past, there was a lot of windshield time, there was a lot of dead time, unproductive time as adjusters drove around, driving to cars, driving to body shops for both initial estimates and supplements, and we looked at that and realized that emerging technologies, data and analytics could rectify that and take some of the inefficiency out of the system. So we began the digitalization of the claims process. Last year, we launched a new immediate payment method which we called Quick Card Pay. Quick Card Pay is the fastest claim payment method in the P&C industry. We make payments directly to the debit cards within seconds. We\u2019ve also been assessing roof damage with from hell event utilizing drowns, and we\u2019ve been doing that quite successfully for the last several quarters. In the last quarter, we open two digital operating centers. They handle auto claims on the countrywide basis by estimating through photos. Approximately half right now of all drivable vehicles are currently being inspected through our Quick Photo method of settlement. That has led to the shutdown of many of our driving claim centers and it has also led to reduce need for fuel adjuster adjusters since we took a lot of that inefficiency out of the system. We now have our adjusters looking at enhance photos, digital photos in the computers without having to drive tooling from the sites. We\u2019ve also began utilizing video chat technology to review supplemental damage with auto body shops, it\u2019s something we call virtual assist and the combination of all those things has led to a dramatically more productive and more efficient claim system. We've taken a cycle that use to take five to seven days in order to get eyes on a vehicle and get an estimate at and we\u2019ve done that now in hours and we are literally doing that in under claim for hour. So, for supplementary instead of having for schedule when adjusted from back out to body shop and look at supplemental damage, we now use to video chat technology same day and we move it along everybody sat either customer get the car back center, the body shop gets the car up their much sooner and they take another car in. And we are reducing rental car time and improving customer satisfaction. So we do believe that the combination to be leads to more efficient system, it leads to obvious cost savings as we take inefficiency out of the system and it leads to greater customer satisfaction. Tom Wilson : Sarah, this is Tom. So I think you might have to go back and look at the ULAE, your number seemed higher to me. I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re slicing out, but you can get that from John. Let me pick up on Matt's Virtual Assist, so this is -- that\u2019s really a great technology and we\u2019re making available to other insurance company. Basically, as Matt mentioned, it's face time that combined with your claim system. And so, if what enables you to do, it not yet somebody drive out the body shop to do the supplement and that you can do it remotely. So, we\u2019re -- this is -- it\u2019s available to Arity, so if insurance companies want to use it, this is where we can use our market leading movement here because we think we\u2019re ahead of other people and doing this because you don\u2019t have to go out and train a bunch of body shops how to use this technology. We\u2019ve already trained body shops on it and deployed. So, we\u2019re making that available to other insurance companies. So that's my commercial for Arity. Sarah DeWitt : Okay. And can you quantify the savings you've seen from these initiatives at all? Tom Wilson : Here is what I would say is, we\u2019re not going to qualify the exact savings. It\u2019s obviously when we take the charge of $52 million, it\u2019s not all that was related to that claim fees. Some was related to restructuring in the legal department. But, we obviously expect the earn net back in a relatively short period of time. And so, that's not five years, it's not five days either. But, so it's pretty substantial savings on an absolute dollar basis. When you look at percentage basis, it's obviously much smaller. Okay, we break all that number -- we break out the restructuring fees by component in the Q. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your question please. Jay Gelb : The Allstate brand underlying combined ratio in auto clearly improved year over year, although it was higher quarter over quarter. I'm just wondering if there is some seasonality that would explain that or if there is some other cause? Tom Wilson : That would make anything of it, Jay. It bounces around. You'll remember the first quarter January and February were much lower, so really better look at it versus the prior year quarter because of weather patterns. Jay Gelb : All right. I thought there was some seasonality there. Okay. And then on a bigger picture -- has Allstate given thought to purchasing increased catastrophe reinsurance protection on the working layer catastrophes? It seems that over the past or the Company is on track over the past two years to have around 8 points of catastrophe losses. So, as reinsurance rates keep dropping I'm wondering if there might be an opportunity there for increased risk transfer. Tom Wilson : I'll make some general comments and then Steve may well jump in. So, first we look at reinsurance broadly continuously and have helped actually develop markets whether that'd be cat bonds or larger longer-term aggregates where we grew out three plus years which were never available before. So we are always active in the market and that's because we're obviously one of the biggest buyers in the market, so people respond to our request. But it comes in couple of different ways, I think what you're suggesting is have we looked at using reinsurance to moderate the annual impact of what I'll call non-large models events, so hail, windstorm and stuff, and so having a lower level of protection. We feel we can handle that in the volatility, that volatility in our P&L. We look over the at the homeowners business each of the rolling last 12 months, we've made over $1 billion a year, and it gets expensive when you look at. When you go the higher end levels, there is sort of a one in a 100 year event, it has obviously the benefit of not having to have that volatility event back that that event happens, but it also is a capital relief tool. So, we don't mind paying a little higher price for that because we think we can earn a higher return on our equity then the reinsurers need to because of their portfolio diversification and our specific needs, we use it for that purpose. But I would say we're always looking at different ways to do it, we're always trying to moderate the amount of capital we have to put out and maximize the return we get on that capital. Steve, do you want to add? Steve Shebik : I think you did a pretty good Tom. The only couple of things that might add, we do look not only buying more but how we structure the reinsurance and so we look at annually, it's kind of an annual buy for Allstate in the early part of the year and for Florida, it's going to be mid-part of the year. So if you look particularly this year, we did buy a 200 million cover in the Southeast Florida, in Southeast for auto, which kind of filled in up whole we thought we had, in terms of bringing down retention dollar fit for that area. So we continue to look not only how it was structured, but there is whole we think might be if a storm were to hit, we focus on that. And as Tom said, it's really economics. And generally what we've seen over the last ample of years, it's hasn\u2019t effect economic for us at that time to buy more or destructed differently. But we are entering into what we consider our normal type period and probably when we look at so we look at again given you our correct. The insurance rate has continued to move down. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question please. Elyse Greenspan : As you guys talk about looking to grow in auto and some of your comments you also did mention in home. Can you just remind us about the bundling within your book, those that purchase both auto and home coverages? And how you expect as you look to improve the retention in auto, how you expect that the play out in home? Tom Wilson : Matt will answer for the Allstate brand and then Don will make a comment on Esurance because I think there is one of the analyst write-ups last night there was a comment about the Esurance that makes sense. Matt Winter : Sure, Elyse. It's Matt. So let me talk about the Allstate brands. The last couple of years have bundling capabilities and we have bundled primarily with auto and another product auto and home, auto and life, auto and consumer household products and with all the disruption in the auto business, it has influenced and impacted the potential growth of the other business first. We know that we watch the home area specifically and we know that home is lagging auto because not only because of the 12 month policy and home but the different renewal periods. And as a result, you tend to see a lag in the growth. So when -- when auto kick-up, it tends to be a quarter or two before home takes-up. And so we're still seeing some of the influence from that disruption in home even though auto has began to stabilize internally other way. Our expectation is fully that as this works its way through the system and I remind you that a lot of growth was taken just to over 12 months ago it has now worked its way through the system as this stabilized and as we hope retention stabilize it's in potentially improved we expect to see our capacity for bundling to improve. We like that obviously number one we want to serve customers holistically we think it's a 100% consistent with our trusted advisors strategy, but it also helps to leverage the single acquisition cost across multiple product lines, leading to a more efficient system and a more efficient use of marketing fronts. So, as you should expect to see continued emphasis on the part of the Allstate brand to increase the bundling, increase the number of product sold for household, and increasingly meet the needs of our customers. Don, you want to talk about our future? Don Civgin : First, much of what Matt said about the Allstate brands, Allstate body to the Esurance brand and actually the other brands as well as you see across the industry people, different companies have maybe made the bundle for their customers. That recall them, we acquired Esurance six years ago as a monoline company, so they sold all the auto insurance. If the time we knew that there was an opportunity for us to homeowners to get a different kind of relationship with the customers and that given the different type of customers. Now, we have -- and by the way we obviously not having the homeowners as a corporation. And so, we were able to leverage the skill we have at Allstate as we build out the Esurance capabilities. The Esurance now has homeowners in 31 states, bundling is a very important to us for the same reasons Matt talked for Allstate. Our attach rates are going up dramatically, as we roll the product out and make it available to customers. And so, it will offer us an opportunity to increase retention, build the different customer relationship and really build the business. Now, I want to temper those comments, there is only $20 million net return premium here in the second quarter. We have 69,000 policies. It's still relatively small percentage of the book. And there is still volatility in that number, so few large losses will swing back loss ratio up by dramatically, as it did in the second quarter. But, we\u2019ve done for strategic reasons, it\u2019s delivering everything we expect and I think it\u2019s a big opportunity for us to continue to growing Esurance. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. And then in terms of capital return, you mentioned the new 2 billion buyback program and being financed with capital at hand in your earnings. How do you view M&A right now? I mean you just completed the SquareTrade deal, but any kind of high-level thoughts how you think M&A is still part of the equation as you think about capital return here? Don Civgin : Well, of course thing we do is look at managing the overall capital and we\u2019d like to invest in our existing businesses to the extent that we can, which is organic growth of obviously leverages our real capabilities for higher returns. We do look at acquisitions and as you mentioned we brought SquareTrade to broadening our product portfolio broadening our distribution we have and give us additional products to be able sell through the adjusted advisor issue through Esurance. And so, if you look at them what we do after that so if we don\u2019t have additional use of the money, we should return it to the shareholder and help increase their relative ownership and the Company. So in the last three years, we bought that 15% of the shares outstanding. So, your value should grow up by 15% just because return of capital to shareholders, over five years of spend, a little over 25%. So, I would expect that same pattern to continue if we see something interesting, we'll buy it and we paid a lot of money for a SquareTrade, but we believe we can grow just as we did Esurance and Allstate Benefits. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Kai Pan : First question to follow up on the digital claim processing technology, I just wonder how do you measure the accuracy using photos to settle the initial loss reserve versus using adjusters in person? Matt Winter : Hi, it's Matt. That's a good question. Obviously when you initiate a massive change in process such as this, the quality is one of the most critical things so we did a lot of testing along the way. We still have testing that we do both secondary reviews as well as reviews in persons. So we do selectively have people doing onsite reviews, as I said in the summary that 50% of the drivable cars right now, so we have to look at. And the reality is that quality has been exceptional, supplements are slightly higher but rather an insignificant amount. And the overall quality is quite good. We are continuing to develop our ability to enhance the digital photos and get better visibility into the damage, obviously as our adjustors get more familiar with how to use these photos and what angles to request and how to change the lighting on it we're able to pick up more-and-more information; we're using some technology to actually help us learn from that and compare photos from similar autos and similar types of accidents to help us baseline. So overall the quality has been quite good, actually slightly better than we expected and the productivity and efficiency savings have been tremendous. Tom Wilson : Kai, the reserves, remember these are relatively short tailed. So, within 90 days you know what it costs to fix a car. So it cycles its way through and we think we are good there. Kai Pan : Okay, that's great. By the way, how much do you spend on these R&D investments? It's a part of your expense ratio, right? Tom Wilson : I won't give you a number or percentage. I will just tell you that we always look at these things and expense. We invest heavily in research and development whether that'd be the things we talked about here or Arity for other things, and we believe we can handle with the overall P&L. So we do not resource constrain that. Capabilities and ability to execute might constrains but it is not a money constraint. Kai Pan : My second question is on your sort of like the change of reporting structure. Is there any change in the underlying operating structure? And how big do you think the service business will become a sort of meaningful percentage of the overall like business of the Company? Tom Wilson : The operating structure is sort of -- what we did really was try to align its way we allocate capital in a way we think about our businesses and to give you increased transparency. We don't have a specific goal percentage of revenue or profit we want them any of those period businesses. But let me give you an example, if you go to Allstate Financial, it's the way -- even though we showed people many of the underlying numbers. When Mary Jane manages that overall business, she doesn't just -- people would look at the overall ROE and tell it's like 6%, or 7% or 8% in the quarter and that is that -- Allstate benefits has great ROEs, Allstate like has good ROEs and it's dragged down by annuities business, and we felt like we just needed to show people in a different way. And even though some of this information you could parse out and accumulate together by looking at the Q or the K or the investor supplement. This really increases our transparency by bundling it together for you in a way that aligns with the way we think about to manage the business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question please. Josh Shanker : Allstate. I'm going to apologize in advance because this is going to get in the weeds a little bit, but between Sarah and Kai's questions I'm still having trouble understanding the expenses in technology versus what's in the expense ratio and what's not. Can we talk a little about why the 52 million maybe shows up in the expense ratio? Typically you guys have like 10 million or so of expenses that are other that show up. How should we think about it going forward? And normally, just to understand, you guys are always investing in the future. Why does this show up in the expense ratio and other stuff in the past has not? Tom Wilson : So, it's not just -- let me be clear, it's not about technology expenses. This is about the cost to for severance for people who were no longer to be required so that's over 500 people, and we have 937 drive-ins, now a lot of those overtime, we structured and month-to-month leases because we knew we are headed here. But we still have in charge to take I mean shut things down, getting leasehold improvements out. So, it's really -- that's not really related to the investment in it at all. It's really related to the shutting down of other stuff. Why does it show up in underlying combined ratio, is the question Matt and I have harangued Steve with for the last three weeks. And our restructuring charges have always been in there, so I think you should expect to continue to see I mean there even though they perhaps are not a continuing and we would think in terms of underlying. So I don\u2019t think you should expect us to take a $52 million charge there in quarter. With that said to the extent we need to take the charge or any charge really, as we manage it quite on cash flow and economic returns. And if it rattles through the P&L, it rattles through the P&L. Josh Shanker : Okay, that's perfect. I am on the same page now. And then the limited partnerships, I mean I'm not going to get a great answer out of it, but they were phenomenal this quarter. Were there any specific gains taken that were unusual or was it just a great quarter for mark-to-markets? How should we think about this going forward? Tom Wilson : John will give you that perspective. John Griek : Thanks, Josh, this is John. It was a combination of factors. One, we have been building up the book of business you expect that the return that the book of business we get larger. But two, favorable markets to the influence when you look at our performance base assets that you have a correlation of about 70% to public markets so that was a fact there. And then three, to answer your question specifically, there were a few idiosyncratic properties that performed quite well and credit to the team that sifts through many-many opportunities there were some down to the one that make most sense to this firm and investment. Josh Shanker : Well, if you need some more co-investment let me know, I have got -- I will try. John Griek : If I get good returns, right. Jonathan, we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly, our final question then comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Your question please. Bob Glasspiegel : Thanks for squeezing me in. One numbers question. On your net investment income page on 51 -- I'm going in the weeds, I apologize -- your fixed income yields are actually up year-over-year despite the fact you've shortened maturities. How have you been able to keep the yield on fixed incomes going up in a low interest rate world with shorter maturities? John Griek : Hi, this is John again. As you would imagine that the combination of events can cause changes in yields, not only where you are placed on the yield curve, but also what investments you buy in the market. So part of that is in response to increased holding in securities like high yield and other higher yielding securities. We also did and it should be noted while it is a small move. In the first quarter of this year, we did extend the duration of portfolio by about a quarter of the year and that impacted yields by about 20 basis points. Bob Glasspiegel : Got you. And one other quickie. On the preferred that you say you are going to issue to help fund the buyback, what's the motivation there? What roughly yield and magnitude are we talking? John Griek : So, we\u2019re looking at part of the potential funding to our buyback. Bob Glasspiegel : Right. John Griek : So, I think currently right now the market seems fairly attractive and this kind of goes on cycles. And so we will look at that as part of that financial, obviously, we don\u2019t have to do it because we have plenty of capital and cash. But when opportunities there, we think our track available we want to take advantage of that. Bob Glasspiegel : Rough idea of the size and yield that you would be paying? Ballpark? John Griek : Well, the yield should be as low as possible from our standpoint. Bob Glasspiegel : Right. John Griek : You saw a deal went out earlier this week and a couple of ticks over five. And so when you can issue perpetual equity that as we guarantee a 5% return you can use that as a buyback comment, we think that\u2019s a good trade on behalf of shareholders. And as you know we\u2019ve done a 1 billion a three quarters of it over the last, Steve, two or three years. Steve Shebik : Four years. John Griek : Four years and we like the results of that. And so there is more -- you wouldn't obviously do this for a $100 million bucks, it\u2019s not worth all the overall effort. So, we haven\u2019t sized it, but there is plenty of opportunities for us to issue given our brand name, our credit capacity and our affiliated payments. Bob Glasspiegel : Thank you. John Griek : Let me close by, again, thank you all for participating. Overall, we made an excellent on our five operating priorities most importantly better serving the customers, achieving economic returns and capital employ really managing our investments. We also are beginning to focus more on growing the customer base and then always again building long-term growth platform whether that's investing in integrated digital, enterprise or new initiatives like SquareTrade and Arity. Looking forward, we\u2019re just going to stay focus on the 2017 priorities and be precise in the way we execute our business balancing both short-and long-term initiatives. So, thank you all and we\u2019ll see you in the next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Allstate Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. John Griek - The Allstate Corp.: Well, thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome, everyone, to Allstate's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by our Chairman and CEO, Tom Wilson; Chief Financial Officer, Steve Shebik; and me, we will have a question-and-answer session. Also here are Matt Winter, our President; Don Civgin, the President of Emerging Businesses; John Dugenske, our Chief Investment Officer; Mary Jane Fortin, President of Allstate Financial; and Eric Ferren, our Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q for the third quarter, and posted the results presentation we will use this morning in conjunction with our prepared remarks. These documents are available on our website at allstateinvestors.com. As noted on the first slide, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2016, the slides, and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release or our investor supplement. We are recording this call, the replay will be available following its conclusion. And as always, I will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. Now I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Well, good morning. Thank you for joining us to stay current on Allstate's operating results. Let's start on slide 2. Overall, we made excellent progress on our 2017 operating priorities. Financially, results were also strong in the quarter. Net income was $637 million or $1.74 per share, operating income was $1.60 per share. Improved profitability in auto insurance reflects the profit improvement actions initiated in 2015, and the decrease in the frequency of auto accidents. Homeowners insurance profitability continues to perform well despite higher catastrophe losses. Investment income increased in both market-based and performance-based portfolios and as a result, Allstate Financial operating improved to $157 million in the third quarter. Operating income return on equity was 13.9%, which is shown in the bottom right of that slide, a significant improvement over last year. If you turn to slide 3, we continued to deliver on all five operating priorities. The first goal is to better serve our customers and we measure customer satisfaction by a Net Promoter Score, and it increased for most of our businesses. We also continue to build an integrated digital enterprise, as evidenced by the expansion of QuickFoto Claim, which reduces auto claim settlement times from days to hours, and lowers our expenses. We continued to excel on our priority to achieve target economic returns on shareholder capital. This is demonstrated by a reported combined ratio of 95.2% for the first nine months of the year. And while Allstate Annuities income increased significantly due to investment results, the overall returns, however, are still low. Total policies in force increased to 78 million policies, largely due to SquareTrade and Allstate Benefits growth. Excluding SquareTrade, Property-Liability policies in force did decline, but the Allstate brand auto insurance new issued applications continued to accelerate, and customer retention improved for the Allstate and Esurance brands. Allstate Benefits continued its 17-year track record of growth with policies in force up 8.1% from the prior year. Market-based portfolio returns reflect stable income and higher valuation benefiting from favorable market conditions. The performance-based portfolio results were strong, and private equity appreciation, and sales of underlying investments. We're also investing for long-term growth that includes businesses such as Allstate Benefits, SquareTrade and our connected-car platform at Arity. Slide 4 shows Property-Liability results by customer segment and brands. Let's start with the table at the top. Net written premium was $8.6 billion, a 3.3% increase from the prior year. The recorded combined ratio of 94.7% was 0.8 points better than the third quarter of 2016. Included in these results were $128 million in non-catastrophe prior year reserve releases. The favorable reserve re-estimates reflected $260 million in Allstate Protection releases, partially offset by $88 million in reserve strengthening for discontinued operations related to the annual Asbestos and Environmental Reserve review. When we exclude catastrophes and prior year reserve re-estimates, the underlying combined ratio for the first nine months of 2017 was 85.2%. The full year result is not expected to be better than the favorable end of the annual outlook range of 87% to 89% provided in February. As you know, our strategy is to provide different customer value propositions for each of the four customer segments of the Property-Liability market, which are shown on the table down below the graph there. The Allstate brand's in the lower left competes in the local advice and branded segment and our most prominent competitors there are State Farm, Nationwide and Farmers. Obviously, GEICO and Progressive target these customers as well, but they don't offer the same value proposition provided by our 10,400 Allstate agencies. This segment comprises of approximately 90% of our total premiums written. Net written premium was 2.5% higher in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year quarter, due to a 3.2% increase in auto insurance. The underlying combined ratio was 84.3% with a favorable prior year comparison being driven by improved loss trends in auto insurance, which had a 91.2% underlying combined ratio, 4.7 points below the prior year quarter. Esurance in the lower right serves customers who prefer a branded product but are comfortable handling their own insurance needs. GEICO and Progressive Direct have a larger share of this segment than their overall market share. The underlying combined ratio for auto insurance continues to improve relative to prior year and was slightly below 100%. Esurance also now sells homeowners in 31 states and net written premium for the quarter is up 50% from the prior-year quarter. Growth in homeowners offers a significant opportunity to bundle products, lower average acquisition costs, increase retention, and build a stronger relationship with our customers. Encompass in the upper left competes for customers who want local advice, but are less concerned about the brand of insurance they purchase. We're making good progress in improving underlying margins, but the business is getting smaller as we exit unprofitable markets and raise prices. In states where we're rate adequate, we are executing growth plans. John will now go through Allstate, Esurance, and Encompass results in more detail. John Griek - The Allstate Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Let's go to slide 5 to cover the results for Allstate brand auto insurance. Starting with the top left graph, the recorded combined ratio for the third quarter was 94.9%, which was 4.1 points better than the prior year quarter, reflecting increased average earned premium, lower frequency, and favorable prior year reserve re-estimates, but was offset by higher catastrophe losses, particularly from Hurricane Harvey. The underlying combined ratio of 91.2% in the third quarter of 2017 improved by 4.7 points compared to the third quarter of 2016, driven by a 6.1-point improvement in the underlying loss ratio. The underlying loss ratio is now performing in line with the levels achieved in early 2014, prior to the rise in auto accident frequency. The chart on the top right shows the results of the broad-based profit improvement plan initiated in 2015. Annualized average premiums, shown by the blue line, increased to $1,015 while underlying loss and expense, shown by the red line, was flat. This resulted in a favorable gap at $89 per policy compared to the mid-teens experienced in the third quarter of 2015. Gross frequency trends for bodily injury and property damage coverages are shown on the bottom chart. Frequency continued to show improvement across both coverages in the third quarter 2017, and favorable trends were geographically widespread. Externally, frequency trends in 2017 have moderated across the industry and a portion of the frequency decline can also be attributed to the shift to longer tenured and higher quality risks as a result of the profit improvement initiatives. Earlier this year, we instituted a comprehensive program to increase policy growth as Allstate brand auto insurance has returned to historical margins. Slide 6 shows the underlying drivers of policies in force for Allstate-branded auto insurance. As you can see from the graph on the top, the overall policy count has flattened over last two quarters. The bottom two charts highlight both the renewal ratio and new issued applications for Allstate branded auto insurance. The renewal ratio is a bigger influence on total policies in force than new business, and we remain focused on retention drivers that are within our control. Key retention initiatives include improving customer satisfaction and engagement while maintaining a stable pricing environment. We anticipate higher customer satisfaction coupled with more moderate auto insurance pricing to translate into higher retention. The renewal ratio of 87.7% was an improvement of 0.2 points from the prior year quarter. Growth in new issued applications continues to accelerate and increased 11.5% in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. 41 states, including our 10 largest, experienced increases in new issued applications compared to the prior year quarter, with 29 states experiencing double-digit increases. Executing our Trusted Advisor strategy and expanding distribution capacity should also build growth momentum for the remainder of 2017 and throughout 2018. Slide 7 shows similar information for Allstate brand home owners. The top part of the page provides detail on our profitability results. The homeowners' recorded combined ratio was 81.3% in the third quarter, which generated $319 million in underwriting income as Allstate's effective risk management strategy mitigated significant catastrophes in the third quarter. As a result of the comprehensive reinsurance program we have in Florida, a large portion of the property losses related to Hurricane Irma were ceded, and did not impact operating profit. Over the last 12 months, $1 billion of underwriting income has been generated by this product line, net of catastrophes. The bottom half of the page provides detail on policies in force, which declined 1%. The renewal ratio of 87.5% was 0.4 points lower than the prior year quarter. New issued applications growth did accelerate to 5.3% in the quarter as 6 of our 10 largest states experienced increases. As auto insurance retention increases and new business increases, we expect to see a favorable impact on homeowners' policies in force. Slide 8 highlights results for Esurance. Esurance is focused on improving financial results and positioning the business to resume growth in total policies in force. The recorded combined ratio of 104.4% in the third quarter, shown on the left chart, was 5.4 points below the prior year quarter, driven by lower expense ratios in auto and homeowners insurance. The 5.4 point expense ratio decrease reflects reduced homeowners advertising, improved customer service efficiency, and a smaller impact from the amortization of intangible assets. The auto underlying combined ratio was 99.8% in the third quarter, 2.2 points better than the third quarter of 2016, as shown below the graph on the left. Lower expenses, coupled with better frequency and severity trends, contributed to the improvement in underlying margins. Esurance policies in force highlighted on the right chart declined slightly compared to the third quarter of 2016. Policy growth in homeowners is nearly offsetting the decline in auto policies. New issued applications declined as a result of lower advertising while auto retention improved by 2.9 points as we have focused on improving customer service and targeted more standard and preferred risk business. Slide 9 shows similar information for Encompass. Encompass generated $29 million of underwriting income in the third quarter, driven by underlying profitability improvement and lower catastrophes. Shown in the left chart, the recorded combined ratio was 89.2% in the third quarter. The decline in premium and policies in force in states with inadequate returns has impacted overall top-line trends, and targeted growth plans have been initiated in states that have attractive profitability prospects. And now I'll turn it over to Steve. Steven E. Shebik - The Allstate Corp.: Thanks, John. Let's go to slide 10, which reflects the detail of SquareTrade. As you know, we acquired SquareTrade in January of this year to expand our product offering and distribution channel, particularly as it relates to cell phones, computers and televisions. Attractive acquisition economics are predicated on achieving two primary objectives : First, continued growth of the retail business to existing partners and new retail distribution; second, improving margins by leveraging fixed costs and reducing the utilization of third-party underwriting arrangements. The acquisition will create shareholder value by achieving these two goals. Additional value can be traded by leveraging the SquareTrade's platform for additional growth, such as expansion in Europe. SquareTrade made good progress on these key performance metrics as shown in the bottom half of the page. Policies in force increased by 2.8 million policies from the second quarter to 34.1 million policies. Over the last 12 months, policies in force grew 32%. The underwriting loss totaled $29 million in the third quarter, reflecting $23 million of amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition. When you exclude the amortization of purchased intangibles and purchase accounting adjustments, the adjusted operating loss was $2 million for the quarter. Slide 11 highlights our investment results. A lot has gone right for investors in 2017, which when combined with a proactive investment approach resulted in 12.7% increase in investment income from the prior year quarter. Investment income shown in blue in the top chart has contributed approximately 1% return each quarter with primarily stable earnings from our market-based portfolio, and an increasing contribution from a performance-based portfolio. The GAAP total returns our diversified $83 billion portfolio have been fairly consistent over the first three quarters of the year with the third quarter contributing 1.5%. Returns have benefited from purposeful asset allocation decisions including our shift to performance-based investments. Variability in our total return generally rises from changes in portfolio value between quarters as reflected by the valuation component shown in grey. Substantially, all asset classes registered positive returns, which reflected in an increase in our fixed income and equity portfolio value. Fixed income valuations increased by merely from tighter credit spreads. Equity valuations also increased on prospects of higher global economic growth. The components of net investment income are shown in lower left graph. The portfolio is largely comprised of market-based investment, the carrying value of the market-based portfolio makes up more than 90% of the total portfolio and approximately 75% of total investment income in the quarter. Net investment income for the third quarter was $843 million, $95 million higher than third quarter of 2016. This increase is driven primarily by performance-based investment income of $227 million, also included a favorable contribution from our market-based portfolios. Performance-based assets have higher long-term returns, which compensated investors for higher variability and lower liquidity. The funding for these investments is from long-dated liabilities in capital, which enables us to stay invested despite short-term valuation volatility. As a result, on a risk-adjusted basis, these assets generate more shareholder value than fixed income investments. Effective in January of 2018, equity securities and cost method limited partnership interest we measured at fair value, and valuation changes recorded a net income. This accounting change may increase the variability of our performance based results in 2018 and thereafter. Turning to slide 12, Allstate Financial profitability increased reflecting strong performance-based investment income, and favorable mortality. Premiums and contract charges totaled $593 million in the third quarter, an increase of 3.9% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating income of $157 million increased 67% over the prior year quarter as shown on the bottom left graph. Life insurance operating income was $74 million, a $23 million increase compared to prior year quarter as shown in blue on the bottom of this slide. This is due to favorable mortality experience and higher additional life insurance premiums. Allstate Benefits operating income was $28 million with $3 million above the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher premium and contract charges, partially offset by higher contract benefits. Annuities operating income of $55 million in the quarter was an increase of $37 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting the continued benefit of our performance-based investment strategy as well as lower contract benefits. Currently, regulatory required capital levels are substantially higher for performance-based assets and fixed income investments. This suppresses reported returns in capital as it relates to the immediate Annuity business. In our view, there needs to be a better alignment of capital requirements with economic outcomes. This will reduce the amount of capital utilized for immediate annuity and to raise reported return on capital. Slide 13 provides an overview of our capital strength and financial flexibility. As you see from the box at the top, we have delivered excellent returns, increased book value, and maintained a conservative financial position while increasing shareholder ownership of the company and reduced the number of outstanding shares. Operating income return on equity was 13.9% for the 12 months ended September 30, 2017. Included in this result is a pension settlement loss of $86 million pre-tax, which is recorded in the Corporate segment in the third quarter. We returned $1.24 billion to common shareholders through the first nine months of the year. This includes repurchasing 10 million shares of our common stock or 2.7% of those outstanding at the beginning of the year. We remain on track in executing the $2 billion share repurchase program that was approved in August. Lastly, as we discussed in our second quarter earnings call, we will adopt a new reporting structure in the fourth quarter that will expand our reportable segments from four to seven. The new structure will provide enhanced transparency and allow for an evaluation of our businesses proved by like attributes. Allstate Protection will continue to include the traditional Property-Liability businesses that addressed the four segments of the consumer market; Allstate, Esurance, Encompass, and Answer Financial. A new Service Businesses segment will include operations that have a larger portion of earnings in services, but generally have less underwriting risk. This will include SquareTrade, Arity, Allstate Roadside, and Allstate Dealer Services. Allstate Financial will be split into three segments; Allstate Life, Allstate Benefits, and Allstate Annuities, which have different growth and return characteristics. This new segmentation will impact our goodwill impairment testing and the aggregation of Allstate Financial reserves for sufficiency testing. We estimate a goodwill impairment of approximately $125 million will be recognized in the fourth quarter related to the goodwill allocated to the Allstate Annuities reporting unit. The Discontinued Lines and Coverages, and Corporate and Other reporting segments will not be impacted. More information on this is available in our Form 10-Q we filed yesterday. Now I'll ask Jonathan to open the line up for your questions. Operator : Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your question, please. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Can you discuss the shift toward growth in the Allstate brand auto business? And whether the underlying underwriting margin can continue to improve in that scenario? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Good morning, Jay. Matt will cover the growth plans that were initiated earlier this year. As you think about where our situation is, I think it's important to look at the external environment. So in terms of what's happening externally, what happens here underwriting margin, obviously, the external environment is a big component, which our competitors are doing, and our read of the competitive situation is that our competitors are either taking or need to take increased prices higher than ours based on where we're at today, which should put us in a good competitive position. So we think we're well positioned to do that. Matt, you want to talk to what we're doing? Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: Sure. Good morning, Jay, it's Matt. Thanks for the question. So the growth plan is I'm going to oversimplify it probably, but first understand that it's in two large buckets. Remember, when we reported growth, we're not only talking about new business growth, we're talking about increased retention. As John mentioned in his earlier comments, retention can actually have a greater influence on overall item in force growth than new business. So we have five buckets of growth initiatives under the new business side, and three under the retention side. On the new business side, it's pretty basic. We're trying to do five separate things. Number one, increase distribution capacity that's more exclusive agencies, more licensed sales professionals, especially in underpenetrated areas like the Heartland and parts of the United States where we do not have appropriate level of market share. Number two, we want to make the distribution more productive and efficient. And that's through the use of technology, use of data and analytics, better lead generation, and more sophisticated segmentation. The third is to get that distribution more engaged and investing in their businesses. And that's through some redesigns and enhanced compensation and recognition programs, the additional support and coaching. Four, we want to provide them better priced and higher value products to sell. So that's using more sophisticated pricing techniques, better underwriting to improve their close rates. And fifth is to drive more quotes to them, so with better marketing and more segmented marketing. So on the new business side, it's pretty basic, more points of presence, capable of quoting more and closing at higher close rates. On the retention side, there's basically three components : Better onboarding, so that first experience with Allstate after they make the purchase decision is a positive one, better advices service throughout the course of their relationship and that means things like annual reviews of their coverage, it means appropriate amounts of touch points with the customer to ensure that they're happy with their service. And finally, on retention, less rate shop, more stable rate environment, so less triggers for shopping. So we think the combination of all the work we're doing on the new business side, and the retention side has started to show up in our numbers, that's why you're seeing the increased retention and new business rates. And we expect that to continue as we further execute on the growth plan. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: So Matt's comment is appropriate around 90% of the business is of the Allstate's brand. If you look at the pipeline of where the other brands are, the next one up would be Esurance, John maybe you can make a comment on that, and Encompass is farther behind in the process, so we won't go through any (27:03) on that. John Griek - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah. So on Esurance, I'm actually really proud when you look at the numbers at the underlying combined ratio. The continued improvement over the last couple of years has been strong. In the third quarter we lowered the underlying combined ratio again by 5.5 points or so over last year. That's a combination of the underlying loss ratio improvement, and a lot of it is expenses, a little over half is advertising, but the rest of it is throughout the system. The improvement has been good. We're also doing couple of other things I think that are positioning the company so that we can go back into kind of growth mode. One is we continued to invest in improving our pricing sophistication, which has helped the loss ratio, and positions us better. We're also taking much better care of our customers, whether it's onboarding or the way we interact with them going forward, our MPS is improving substantially. You don't see that, but you do see retention going up. And in the investor supplement you can see a pretty dramatic improvement in retention year-over-year. What we don't like at this point is that the policy \u2013 the PIP is basically flat. I could argue with a 26% year-to-date decline in advertising, that's not horrible, but the reality is it's our growth vehicle. So I think what we've done now is really position the company to be at a much more profitable, much more attractive level from a profitability point of view. Now we're really expecting to pivot more back to growth. I don't expect us to give up the gains we've gotten on the profitability. But I think the work that we've done that's led us to this point will position us well. And I would expect next year we'll begin to grow the business again, maybe not the 20% or 25% like we were three or four years ago, but we're going to get back to growth. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for those thorough answers. And my only other question was with regard to the outlook for Allstate's reinsurance protection in 2018. Clearly, the company benefited from the smart purchases, substantial reinsurance protection in the wake of Harvey and Irma, and just trying to get a sense what your thoughts are going into next year? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Jay, obviously our risk management programs that we've put in place over the last decade has served us well, and we still made $300-plus million for underwriting income in homeowners this quarter despite the high cats. The reinsurance really was related to Irma in Florida because we had bought down so low there. I think there are still a lot of alternative capital in the reinsurance market. We don't expect to see prices firm up a lot. But we won't know that until we get to next year. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill, your question please. Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Good morning. I have a somewhat related question on the growth potential. Assuming that your growth efforts work, and the reason I think not, how should we think about the tenure impact on the auto and on the home book respectively? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Paul, I just want to make sure I get it right, you mean tenure as in T-E-N-U-R-E or 10-year as in... Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : As in the aging of the book and how that changes profitability. Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah. Paul, it's Matt, it's a really good question because obviously, one of the impacts of our profit improvement plan that we executed over the last couple of years in response to the initial frequency spike was that we took segmented rates. And in many cases, not only did that drive out the worst-performing segments, but it lowered our overall new business growth, and therefore, lowered our new business penalty. It lowered the penalty, but it comes at a huge cost. As we grow, we expect to have that \"new business penalty\" pick up a little bit; we'll have a lower tenured group coming into the overall book. The difference is though, we are now priced rate adequate in all of the segments. We feel very good that we're appropriately priced, and we're moderating it, and we believe the quality of that new business will be quite high. And so we believe that while there will be a lower tenured group coming in and the associated new business penalty, we think it's very manageable and we think that we're set up perfectly to absorb it and deal with it. Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Great. Thank you. I guess, my second question relates to the SquareTrade. Any update on moving some of that business from your partner's books to Allstate's favor? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah. There were a couple of contracts domestically. The larger of those contracts was transferred to Allstate. So we're taking the underwriting risk that was in the second quarter. I expect the other contract will transfer towards the end of this year beginning next year. Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Great. Congratulations on the quarter. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Your question please. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Wanted to hear your thoughts on the outlook for homeowners insurance, pricing following the third quarter catastrophes? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Sarah, are you speaking about ours or the industry in total? Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Both. Do you think pricing could go up following all the hurricanes? Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: Sarah, it's Matt. It's a good question. I think what we discovered over this year with two back-to-back cat four hurricanes and all the associated issues that we've had this year is that our product design and our risk management, our PML work, our reinsurance work, our risk concentration work, and our consistent diligence on pricing served us well. So we feel quite good about it. As you saw, we did very well, we had good underwriting income in the quarter despite what was an exceptionally difficult timeframe for homeowners. So we don't feel like we have a need to react to what we've seen. We, of course, will continue to analyze it, and to ensure that we understand the dynamics in severe weather, and the cats, and the cat load as appropriate. But right now, we feel like we're in a very good place. Our House & Home products served us very well, the design worked well. We now have that 90% of our new business in that product and about a third of our total book, and we're very pleased with the performance of that during these weather events, not only the cats, but the additional weather events that we've had this year. So for Allstate right now, it's pretty much steady as she goes, and continue to analyze increased amounts of data as it comes in. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks. And then just on Allstate Financial, how should we be thinking about the run rate earnings in that business? The last two quarters, have been running over $150 million of operating income. But prior to that, it was only a little over $100 million. So any help you could provide there would be helpful? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Sarah, it is a good question because Allstate Financial did have a quarter, Mary Jane could talk about both the various components for the life insurance, and then annuity. I would say the \u2013 while the operating income was good in both of those businesses, now we still like to do better in terms of return on the annuities book, so that's still something we have to work on, but we're very pleased, Mary Jane could talk about the actual results we had. Mary Jane Bartolotta Fortin - The Allstate Corporation : Thank you. From an earnings perspective, let's start with the annuities. In terms of the annuities, what I really do think about it is really the performance-based investments were very strong in performance in the quarter, they generated about a 15% return. So as we look out, we would expect that asset class to generate returns in more in the 10% to 12% range. So when you look at, think about the annuity line of business, consider that performance-based asset class continuing to moderate down toward a 10% to 12% level. So the levels we have experienced in the last two quarters has been higher than we would expect. The quarter also annuities benefited from favorable lower contract benefits, favorable mortality. That can tend to fluctuate from period-to-period, but that did impact the quarter by about $10 million on a year-over-year basis. And in terms of the life insurance, we did experience favorable mortality in the quarter. We have been running better-than-expected, and this too, mortality can tend to fluctuate from period-to-period. So you should expect us in the life business earnings come back down as mortality reverts back to an expected level. The life business and the benefits business, we ran those to a 10% to 12% return target. So you should expect to see returns in that range as we move forward. And as Tom mentioned on the annuity side of the house, we're continuing to manage that loss for long-term economics, and you will see some variability in the results from period-to-period as that performance-based asset class can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Your question please. Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thanks and good morning. Two questions if I may. The first question relates to the discussion on external factors contributing to frequency improvement. If you go back to slide 5, and look in the trendline, what should we use as a starting point if I was trying to exclude these external factors? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Amit, it was just \u2013 I think I got it a little light in terms of voice coming through. So let me see and I'll turn it over to Matt. So the reason we talked about the external factors was not because we thought that, that was a primary driver. We do think that our profit improvement actions, which were broad-based and comprehensive drove, it's really about the external environment. A question Jay had raised which is when you're looking forward to growth, you have to look at the external environment. One is the competitors, which you talked about, where are they in pricing. But the other is where are you just in general frequency trend. And so general frequency trends are moderating from what we saw in 2015 and 2016 in terms of percentage increases. That gives us more opportunity to grow without the new business penalty that was brought up by Paul. So Matt, maybe you can touch a little more specifically about the execution? Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: Sure. And let me just point out that, and that's always true with frequency. It's always a product of both internal and external factors. We always talk about the fact that when we had a spike in frequency, we had \u2013 we attributed it to miles driven, which was a product of the unemployment rate as well as lower gas prices. We have weathered that influence \u2013 and you have where you are in your own cycle as for as the tenure of your book, what segments you've been growing in, and things like that. So I think the way to think about it is, if you're trying to figure out how is Allstate going versus the competitors, look at some of that industry benchmarks, I'd encourage you to look at fast-track. So the last fast-track that came out was the second quarter, 12-month mover. That showed Allstate's year-over-year change in physical damage frequency at about three points lower than the industry. So if you think of the industry as a product of their external and their own internal factors, and you think of us, then we look at that and say, assuming the external factors are a constant, that shows the benefit of the work we're doing on our internal factors such as tenure and quality of the business. Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yes. That's helpful. A quick follow-up to that is, I guess, someone else was also asking this question on pricing. Given your commentary regarding let's call it the excess margin that was earned this year, do you think it gives you additional room to adjust pricing downwards to generate more growth in 2018? Thanks. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Amit, just to make sure we get the words right. We don't view margin as excess or short or anything. We thought we earned a good return on our auto business, we think the work we've done has been accurate and it's fair to our customers as opposed to excess. And but you wouldn't see in our history times when we lowered prices on purpose to reflect short-term swing in frequency. Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got it. Thanks for the answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Glasspiegel from Janney. Your question, please. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Good morning, Allstate. Tom, can you either re-give or give what your gross catastrophe losses were, what you ceded to the reinsurers in the quarter? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Gross, we ceded $90 million to our reinsurers in Florida. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : In Florida, nothing in Harvey? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Nothing in Harvey. Harvey was right at the cusp. We have $500 million retention; we had $500 million. There's nothing to cede to them. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : So your reinsurers have done pretty well with you and that's why you said you don't think your reinsurance cost will go up that much? Is that a fair characterization? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Hard to tell what happens to the reinsurance market. It would certainly we're one of the largest purchasers, but we're not the biggest driver as you know. And Harvey, there were a lot of commercial losses and variety of other things going on. At this point in the cycle, it's mostly people trying to use things to talk about what they want to happen as opposed to what will happen. We think our reinsurers in our programs have been well compensated. We think it makes sense for us because we carry less capital because of that. And we have less earnings volatility because of that. And so we like the program we have set up. And just, you know this, I'll just reiterate it, that we have a very staggered and stretched out reinsurance program; goes three, five years some of these programs. So any change in pricing in any given year gets muted in terms of its impact in our reported financials. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. And if I could squeeze one more in, these were great results and frequencies for the industry, sounds like it's a little bit better than industry. In retrospect, did you over sedate the patient in your auto strategy and maybe should have grown a little bit faster or you're comfortable with where your sort of top-line is? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Bob, I'm really pleased with the results. I think our team executed it extremely well with great precision. I do remember, I think in our call in the first quarter of 2015, you thought we were growing too fast as we were seeking to slow the process. We always seek to please, just give us some time to get back to growth mode. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Guilty as charged. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your question please. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Yes. Thanks. A couple of quick ones here for you. First, I'm just curious, Tom and Matt, did the hurricanes have any beneficial effect on kind of your underlying results, underlying combined ratios or frequency ex-cat typically? As you've seen in the past, we're typically there is some decline in frequency during or post a hurricane? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: It's a question that we always ask ourselves, we look at all the numbers. I would say, it's really hard to tell. The best way to get around that really is to look at longer than the frequency and severity numbers over longer than a quarter. So that's why we always talk about homeowners and we'll say latest 12 months, because we want you to understand that there are fluctuations. It's really hard to tell what happens with claiming behavior, whether somebody doesn't call us because they think we're too busy. We tend to find people do call when they have a problem, so it doesn't normally show up there, but it's really hard to tell. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Got you. And then another quick question for you, Tom and Steve. So your stock's trading at a real healthy price-to-book multiple right now, rightfully so given your terrific results. I guess, from a capital management perspective, when it gets to these levels, is there any kind of thought between sending capital back to shareholders via a special dividend instead of share buyback? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Let me make a comment on the valuations first, and Steve can talk about how we think about capital and deploying it in our existing businesses for new opportunities, and then a return to shareholders. As it relates to the current valuation, I would point out that there are some companies that look like us that have substantially higher book value multiples. Like I wouldn't mind three times, and it's also true when you look at the broader market. Steven E. Shebik - The Allstate Corp.: As you know, and we talked about previously, we look at the capital we generate, and we look at how much we need to invest in the business to grow it, which we've talked about a fair amount in this call. Then we look at opportunities we have in terms of growing it not only organically, but inorganically. SquareTrade is an example of that. Then we look, we have to pay our dividends, obviously. We think it's an important part. What's left? We look and say, what do we do with that? And generally, we don't want to hold it for a long period of time, it depresses our returns. So we give it back to shareholders or we find a use to put back in the business. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: And we've not found special dividends to be an attractive way to do that; we tend buy shares back. As the world changed and for some reason whether it was tax policy or something else that led us to do it another way, it is our objective to give it to shareholders in the way that best meets their needs. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for the answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your question please. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Tom, I'm trying to clarify my understanding of the strategy in terms of the speed of incorporating things like benign frequency into pricing. Is there any imperative to do that maybe more frequently with smaller moves because you also talk about pricing stability? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Meyer, we're always looking at pricing at an extremely granular level, and Matt can give some points. But I would say we think of our business like a machine, and it operates at an extremely granular and proactive way on both frequency and severity. Matt can talk about what they've been doing in frequency specifically, but. Matthew E. Winter - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Look, it's always our objective to keep pace with changes in frequency and severity and overall loss costs in a way that maintains our margins and is as least disruptive to our customers as possible. When you have a large spike in either frequency or severity, our belief is, we have to maintain margins and get back to rate adequacy as quickly as possible. And so we will take larger rate amounts as necessarily and as justified when we happen to maintain those margins. We're right now in a much different rate environment than we were in 2014 and 2015. It appears that we're able to take what I would call maintenance rates, inflationary \u2013 normal inflationary damage cost and severity increase rate adjustments, and that tends to be smaller, less disruptive, and does less damage to our retentions. And that is our objective whenever we can. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot. Thank you. The second question, also Tom, in your prepared comments you talked about the main competitors to Allstate being State Farm, Nationwide, Farmers, is that true both on the business that you win, and the business that goes to competitors? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: I'm sorry; I missed the last point here, Meyer. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: When you talk about the most significant competitors to the Allstate brand and the exclusive agency distribution channel, are those the companies that both provide your wins and take some business from Allstate? Or is the mix of those two categories different? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Yes. Good, good, really good question. So when we look at the Foursquare (50:40) , we look at people's market share in that segment relative to their overall market share in whole industry. And so in that more or less branded local advice State Farm, Farmers, Nationwide, and Allstate, we have a higher index market share than we \u2013 our overall market share. And that is also true with respect to who we get business from and who we lose business to in that segment. And Matt's team tracks that, we track it by state, by risk class. We look at our quote rates by competitor, we look at close rates by competitor and yet in fact, State Farm as you would expect in that lower left, is the other large significantly branded business, not that Nationwide and Farmers are not but they're the biggest obviously in that sector. And their results do impact what happens to us. If you look at their results, not they need to, they've been losing money in auto. And so we think we're well positioned to grow in that business. It doesn't mean that GEICO and Progressive in their repeat study isn't trying to get the same customers. I'm not trying to imply like they're just buying those customers on the street corner. But the customer value, the advertising tends to drive increased allocation in those specific segments. But we compete with Progressive, GEICO for those customers as well. So I don't want to act like we're the only people, but we just over index a little bit in that segment. And that's why we believe we have an ability to grow in that segment, it's not just GEICO and Progressive, we have to be, but it's Farmers, Nationwide, Progressive and the hundreds of other small regional carriers that are out there we can get. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Tom Wilson for any closing comments. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: So let me just close with a couple of comments. First, we're going to stay focused on achieving balanced operating performance and looking at our five operating priorities, we'll stay proactive, disciplined, make sure we create economic value for our shareholders. So thank you all for participating, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

As a reminder, today\u2019s program is being recorded. And now I\u2019d like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Mr. John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. John Griek : Well, thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome, everyone, to Allstate\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by our Chairman and CEO, Tom Wilson; Chief Financial Officer, Mario Rizzo; and me, we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release, investor supplement, and posted the results presentation we will use this morning in conjunction with our prepared remarks. These documents are available on our website at allstateinvestors.com. As noted on the first slide, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements about Allstate\u2019s operations. Allstate\u2019s results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2016, the slides, and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release or our investor supplement. In the fourth quarter, the company adopted new reporting segments, expanding from four to seven. The new structure provides enhanced transparency and allows for an evaluation of our businesses grouped by like attributes. Also in the fourth quarter, we discontinued the use of the term operating income and have replaced the label with adjusted net income. We are recording this call, and a replay will be available following its conclusion. And as always, I will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Well, good morning. Thank you for joining us to stay current on Allstate\u2019s operating results. At the beginning of the year, we made several leadership changes in anticipation of Matt Winter\u2019s retirement later this month. Matt has been instrumental in our proactive operating approach and helped maintain our deep bench talent. Matt and the rest of the senior leadership team are here with us today, which includes Glenn Shapiro, who\u2019s assumed leadership of the Allstate brand Property-Liability business. Glenn joined us about two years ago. He has 28 years of insurance experience. He successfully lead our claims operation as part of Matt\u2019s team, and they did a number of very innovative things like improving our process is to control costs and introduced new technologies, such as QuickFoto Claim app. Steve Shebik is our Vice Chair, and he\u2019s taken on responsibility for Esurance, Encompass, Allstate Life, Annuities and Benefits, Business Transformation and D3, our analytics operation. You all know Steve, he\u2019s been with us for 23 years and most recently with our Chief Financial Officer. Mario Rizzo is now our Chief Financial Officer, replacing Steve, so you\u2019re going to see a lot of him. He most recently was the CFO of Allstate Protection and he\u2019s been with us for 28 years. Also here with us today are Don Civgin, who is President of Allstate Service Businesses; John Dugenske, who is our Chief Investment and Corporate Strategy Officer; Mary Jane Fortin, who leads our three Allstate Financial businesses, the Life, Retirement and Benefit businesses; Eric Ferren, our Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. So let\u2019s start on Slide 2. We delivered strong results in 2017 and are positioned for profitable growth. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.2 billion or $3.35 per share, but that did include a onetime $506 million increase to net income as a result of the recently passed tax legislation. Adjusted net income per share was $762 million or $2.09 a share, and that excludes the impact of the tax change and $125 million goodwill impairment in Allstate Annuities, which related to the change in reportable segments. For the full year, adjusted net income of $2.5 billion was 34% above it\u2019s prior year and reflect strong performance from our market-facing businesses and investments. The Allstate auto and homeowners insurance margins remain very strong and performance-based investments had outstanding results. Catastrophe losses of $3.2 billion or 26% above the prior year over largely offset by favorable prior year reserve estimates. Adjusted net income return on equity was 13.3%, as you can see on the bottom right. This operational support \u2013 this operational success will support accelerated growth in 2018 while maintaining attractive returns. So let\u2019s go to the Slide 3. Now this addresses the impacts of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act for 2017. So the immediate impact from tax reform is that a onetime $506 million increase to net income, which is driven by a reduction in our net deferred tax liability. This principally relates to deferred acquisition costs, which were already expense for tax purposes at the higher tax rate. It also reflects lower feature taxes on unrealized investment gains. In 2018, we anticipate a corporate tax rate of 19% to 20% compared to our historical effective tax rate in the low 30s. Future auto and homeowners insurance rates filings were reflect the impact of lower tax rates and will be factored into our regulatory filing, but we do not expect us to have a material impact in Allstate\u2019s near-term operating results or competitive position. We are taking advantage in lower taxes to increase growth, enhance the employer value proposition, raise shareholders returns and improve our local communities. We are investing in growth in many of our market facing businesses through marketing, distribution, telematics, new products and technology. Employees will receive $1000 or $2000 choice dollars in 2018 depending on their participation in our medical benefit plan. This money can be contributed to our 401k or health savings account or taken as cash bonus. This structure of employee choice will be incorporated in the future benefit design. We\u2019ll also increase employee training and technology literacy to support sustainable employability. This is increasing in importance, particularly in our business as jobs are reconfigured and eliminated by digital technologies and the increased use of computer decision-making using advanced analytics. Reflecting strong operating results and lower tax in the first quarter dividend was increased by 24%, which is up to $0.46 per common share. We also contributed an additional $34 to the Allstate Foundation in December to expand existing programs. And Allstate Agency supports local process, and you can see this had an impact on fourth quarter expense levels. Turning to Slide 4, we had good results on all five 2017 operating priorities. We better served customers. And the Net Promoter Score which measures how likely customers are to recommend us, increased. Customer retention for Allstate brand auto improved in the second half of 2017 and Esurance auto and homeowners insurance retention increased throughout the year, which have maintained increased growth in 2018. Higher customer satisfaction, in part reflects fewer price increases, but we also improve service in a number of areas, such as expanding utilization; a QuickFoto Claim, which can lower settlement times from days, hours as you probably seen in our advertising. We continue to deliver excellent returns on shareholder capital. The Property-Liability reported combined ratio of 93.6 generated $2 billion in underwriting income for the year. Auto insurance underwriting income increased to the lower accident frequency, higher premiums in favorable prior year reserve reestimates. Allstate brand homeowners insurance posted a combined ratio of 89.4 despite significant catastrophe losses, making this the sixth consecutive year of the combined ratio, which is in below 100. Allstate Life and Benefits generated attractive returns and Annuity income was up, but returns are still low. Total policies in force grew to $82.3 million in 2017. Property-Liability policies in force decline due to the impact of the profit improvement actions began in 2015. SquareTrade policies grew $10 million or nearly 36% in 2017. Allstate Benefits continued its 17-year track record of growth with policies in force increasing by 7.4% in 2017. Total return on $83 billion investment portfolio was 5.9%, reflecting strong results in both the market and performance-based portfolios. We also built long-term growth platforms SquareTrade\u2019s first year performance was very strong and the three factors were success we laid out when the acquisition was closed in January. Arity signed its first third party insurance customer to expand its platform outside the Allstate entities. If you look forward to 2018 going to Slide 5, we are well positioned to accelerate profitable growth. The Property-Liability business is expected to have an annual underlying combined ratio between 86 and 88 in 2018. This range considers the impact of growth and the effect of a lower tax rate that we just discussed. Our priorities for 2018 are consistent with 2017. So the first three better serve our customers, achieve target economic returns in capital and grow the customer base, those are obviously all intertwined, and ensure the corporation has multiple passed through profitable long-term growth. In 2018, Allstate brand Property-Liability, Allstate Benefits, SquareTrade and Esurance are all expected to contribute to growth. Mario will now go through Property-Liability results. Mario Rizzo : Thanks Tom. Slide 6, shows Property-Liability results by customer segment and brand. Starting with the table at the top, net written premium was $7.8billion, a 3.6% increase from the prior year quarter. The recorded combined ratio of 91 was 1.3 points higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in these results were higher catastrophe losses, increased agency and employee compensation cost as well as an increased donation to the Allstate Foundation. This was partially offset by increased premiums earned, lower underlying loss cost and higher favorable prior year reserve reestimates. When we exclude catastrophe\u2019s and prior year reserve reestimates, the underlying combined ratio was 85.7 for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 84.9 for the full year. The full year underlying combined ratio, as historically reported, including the Property-Liability and service businesses, was 85.6, which was below our annual outlook range of 87 to 89. As you know, our strategy is to provide differentiated customer value propositions for the four consumer segments of the Property-Liability market. The Allstate brand in the lower left competes in the local advice and branded segment. Net written premium was 4.1% higher in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to a 4.2% increase in auto insurance premiums. The underlying combined ratio was 84.8 with the favorable prior year comparison, driven by improved loss trends in auto insurance, which had a 94.2 underlying combined ratio two points below the prior year quarter. Esurance in the lower right serves customers who prefer a branded product, but are comfortable handling their own insurance fees. The underlying combined ratio for auto insurance continues to improve relative to prior year and was 101 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Esurance net written premium grew by 2.8% compared to the prior year quarter. Our strategy to broaden customer relationships is successful as homeowners insurance policies increased 36.2% in 2017 with written premium increasing 26.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 99.8 was 5.2 points better than the prior year quarter with improvements in both auto and homeowners insurance. Encompass, in the upper left, competes for customers who want local advice and are less concerned about the brand of insurance they purchase. We continue to make progress in improving underlying margins. Let\u2019s go to Slide 7 to cover the results for Allstate brand auto insurance. Starting with the top left graph, the recorded combined ratio for the full year was 93.2, generating $1.3 billion in underwriting income in 2017. These results reflect increased average earned premium, lower frequency and favorable prior year reserve reestimates, primarily related to injury coverages. The underlying combined ratio of 94.2 in the fourth quarter of 2017 improved by two points compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by a 3.7 point improvement in the underlying loss ratio. The expense ratio was 26.2, 1.7 points above the prior-year quarter. The chart on the top right shows the results of the broad-based profit improvement plan initiated in the second half of 2015. Annualized average premium shown by the blue line increased by 4.5% to $1,022, while underlying loss and expense, shown by the red line increased 2.3%. This resulted in a favorable GAAP of $59 per policy compared to the low 20s experienced in the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross frequency trends for bodily injury and property damage coverages are shown on the bottom chart. In the fourth quarter, frequency continued to perform below the elevated levels experienced in 2015 and 2016 and favorable trends remain geographically widespread. Slide 8 shows the underlying drivers of policies in force for Allstate branded auto insurance. Starting with the graph at the top, overall, policies in force grow sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2017. The bottom two charts highlight both the renewal ratio and new issued applications for Allstate branded auto insurance. The renewal ratio is a bigger influence on total policies in force, and we continue to focus on improving the customer experience. The renewal ratio of 87.8 was an improvement of 0.4 points from the prior year quarter. New issued applications grew year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter, increasing 10.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Executing our trusted adviser strategy, along with expanding distribution capacity and efficiency, will help build growth momentum throughout 2018. Slide 9, shows similar information for Allstate brand homeowners. The top part of the page provides detail on our profitability results. The homeowners recorded combined ratio of 85.4 in the fourth quarter, which generated $252 million in underwriting income, as Allstate\u2019s effective risk and return management strategy drove strong performance despite significant California wildfire losses. For the full year, despite $2.1 billion in catastrophe losses, the reported combined ratio was 89.4; while underwriting income was $725 million for the year, which was a $373 million decrease relative to the prior year. The bottom half of the page provides detail on policies in force, which declined 0.5% in 2017, but grew sequentially compared to the third quarter of 2017. The renewal ratio of 87.5 was unchanged compared to the prior year quarter. New issued applications growth accelerated to 6% in the fourth quarter of 2017. As auto insurance retention and new business levels have improved, we are seeing a favorable impact on homeowners policies in force. Slide 10 provides additional financial highlights for Esurance. Esurance made progress on improving financial results and positioning the business to resume growth in total policies in force. The recorded combined ratio of 100.2 in the fourth quarter, shown on the left chart, was 4.8 points below the prior year quarter, primarily driven by a lower expense ratio. The auto underlying combined ratio for the full year was 100.2, five points below 2016 due to lower expenses. Esurance growth trends are highlighted on the right-hand chart. Net written premiums continue to grow on increased average premium, while policies in force declined compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Policy growth in homeowners partially offset the decline in auto policies due to profit improvement actions. Slide 11 provides additional highlights for Encompass. Encompass continues to improve underlying profitability, while executing growth plans and states with rate adequacy and long-term growth potential. Encompass reported combined ratio was 106.4 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and was impacted by significant catastrophe losses, primarily due to the California wildfires. the underlying combined ratio was 86.4 for the fourth quarter was 4.3 points lower than the prior year period due to improvement in the underlying loss ratio, partially offset by a higher expense ratio. Shown on the right chart, Encompass net written premium declined 7.6%, and policies in force were 14.4% lower in 2017. The decline in premium and policies in force in states with inadequate returns has impacted overall top line trends. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to John. John Griek : Thanks Mario. Let\u2019s go to Slide 12, which provides detail on service businesses, a new reportable segment which offer a broad range of products and services that support our customers and enhance our customer value propositions. Our strategy to deliver superior value propositions and build strategic platforms made good progress in the fourth quarter, as policies in force grew to $43. million and revenue growth accelerated to $264 million for the quarter. Net income of $95 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, included a $134 million benefit from tax reform, while the adjusted net loss was $24 million in the quarter. It its first year under Allstate ownership, SquareTrade had very strong performance and achieved the thee factors for success we identified when the acquisition closed in January. Policies in force grew to $38.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 an increase of $4.6 million policies compared to the third quarter. We executed a 100% quota share agreement this year with our largest third-party reinsurer, which further enhanced the economics of the business. We also continue to invest in accelerating growth, both domestically and internationally. In the fourth quarter, Arity established relationships with insurance and shared mobility companies, expanding its platform outside of Allstate entities. Allstate Roadside Services revenue declined in 2017, reflecting nonrenewal of unprofitable third- party contracts. And adjusted net loss was realized in the fourth quarter and for the year as the new digital platform, which reduces response time, is not yet profitable. Turning to Slide 13, let\u2019s review our Allstate Financial \u2013 Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuities results. As a reminder, these are three new segments, which were historically consolidated into our former Allstate Financial segment. Allstate Life adjusted net shown on the top left chart, was $57 million in the fourth quarter, $9 million decrease compared to the prior year quarter. This is primarily due to increased contract benefits and operating expenses, partially offset by higher premiums. Premium and contract charges, shown on the bottom left, increased 1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Allstate Benefits adjusted net income shown in the top middle chart on the page, was $20 million, a $3 million decrease compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to higher contract benefits and operating expenses, partially offset by higher premiums. Allstate Benefits continued its strong track record of year-over-year top- line growth. Premiums and contract charges, shown on the bottom middle chart, increased 8.3% in the fourth quarter, with 7.4% growth in policies in force in 2017. Allstate Annuities adjusted net income of $55 million in the quarter was an increase of $14 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting higher investment income on continued strong results in our performance-based investment portfolio. Slide 14 highlights our investment results. The markets performed well in 2017, driving positive returns across essentially all asset classes, and our portfolio clearly benefited. While we participated in the market momentum, our investment strategies and risk positioning, including the shift to Performance-based contributed to our strong results. The components of net investment income are shown in the left chart. Net investment income for the fourth quarter was $913 million, 14.4% or $112 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. Market- based investment income, shown in the blue, was stable. Performance-based investment income, shown in the gray, was the primary driver of the increase over 2016, generating $296 million of income in the fourth quarter. Our performance-based investments benefited from higher balances and favorable market conditions, in addition to our performance by select investments and sales into strong markets. The components of annual total return on our diversified $83 billion portfolio are shown in the table on the right. The annual net investment income contribution to returns has been fairly consistent, while realized capital gains and losses and changes in portfolio valuations vary with market conditions, and can be either positive or negative. The contribution to total returns from the income statement and portfolio valuation are shown in the bottom rows of the table. As we mentioned last quarter, beginning in 2018, changes in the fair value of our public equity securities will be reported as realized capital gains and losses and included in net income rather than a component of equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The book value of the portfolio already reflects changes in fair value. However, this accounting change will increase the variability of reported net income, but the long-term economic value creation would be unchanged. Changes in the fair value of our fixed income securities will continue to be reported as unrealized gains or losses as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Slide 15 provides an overview of our capital strength and financial flexibility. As you can see from the box at the top, we have delivered excellent returns, increased book value and maintained a conservative financial position, while increasing shareholders\u2019 ownership in the company by reducing the number of outstanding shares. Adjusted net income return on equity was 13.3% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 2.9 points compared to the prior year period, and book value per common share of $57.58 increased 13.4%. We returned $1.9 billion to common shareholders in 2017. This includes repurchasing 15.8 shares of our common stock or 4.3% of those outstanding at the beginning of the year. As part of our current share repurchase program, on December 8th, 2017, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to purchase $300 million of our outstanding shares of common stock. This agreement was completed on January 5, 2018, and we repurchased a total of 2.9 million shares. Additionally, we paid $525 million, in common shareholder dividends during 2017. The Board of Directors also improved, an increase in the quarterly dividend per common share to $0.46 from $0.37, representing a 24% increase payable in cash in April 2. And now, I\u2019ll ask Jonathan to open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your question, please. Jay Gelb : Thank you. First, on the outlook for the underlying combined ratio in 2018 of 86% to 88%. Clearly, a little higher than 85.6% in 2017. If I look at the midpoint, that would imply I think around $500 million of less underlying profit. Is that driven more by investments in the business relative to tax savings? Or is that more kind of the underlying profitability of the PNC business? Tom Wilson : Good morning, Jay. First, we don\u2019t take the midpoint as the specific target we\u2019re shooting for. We just say we can be in that range. And so as you know, it varies. When we do it, we obviously look at our current results, which you mentioned. We\u2019re also looking at that feature additional investments we\u2019re making. As you know, frequency and severity can vary by a couple of percent each every year. If you just look at this year, what happen with our frequency declining or what happened in 2015 on the flip side of that. So we think this is very attractive return on capital at these levels and the best way to do is to continue to grow shareholder value to grow the top line. Jay Gelb : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up question is I know you mentioned it in the release, but the effective tax reform on prior approval states for auto insurance like California, if you could give us a bit more insight on that based on the regulators comments. I think that would be helpful. Tom Wilson : First, thank you for asking the question. It\u2019s a good question that came up in many of your analyst reports. The headline, of course, is said, we don\u2019t expect any material impact on profitability returns on a competitive position. But let me give you some context below that. Obviously, some states have more restrictive pricing regulations. And obviously, we have to fully meet their requirements. And pricing in those cases would be impacted by lower tax rate. But that\u2019s the not the complete picture, right? So the biggest component of pricing is fixed component there is loss costs., and they are not impacted by the tax rate at all. And if we just look around the industry in auto insurance, for example, you\u2019re talking 70% to 75% of premiums are in that category. And you have about another 20% to 30%, depending on the company, that shows up in expenses. And those are also are impacted by the tax rate. ,: Jay Gelb : That\u2019s helpful. So it sounds like some people over kind of view the impact is it as nearly as hurtful as some people think. Tom Wilson : I can\u2019t speak \u2013 I looked at CFA\u2019s letter, I couldn\u2019t get to their math. Maybe they have a different way to do it. But I can just tell you that when you\u2019re on, if you think of auto insurance and let\u2019s just assume you have a 5% underwriting margin, it\u2019s a little hard to turn that into 5% reduction in premiums. Jay Gelb : Perfect. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Your question, please. Paul Newsome : I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on the investments that you\u2019re going to make? What exactly is going to be accelerated? And if there\u2019s any way to give us a sense of sort of a magnitude of the impact of those accelerated investments? Matt Winter : Hey Paul, it\u2019s Matt Winter. Thanks for the question. Last quarter, before we even knew that about this, I talked about the five buckets of initiatives that we had within the Allstate brand to drive new business growth. And I\u2019ll just remind you that, that included things like increasing distribution capacity. And that is points of presence, additional EAs, additional LSPs, especially in under-penetrated areas, and we will certainly be investing in additional distribution points of presence. Some of \u2013 growing distribution points of presence has always been a great way to stimulate growth in the business. It\u2019s also expensive because they have enhanced compensation programs, and there\u2019s cost of starting those agencies. But we believe now that, that investment is a great opportunity for us. So you should expect to see that distribution capacity increase. On the second area, I talked about was making distribution more productive and efficient through things like technology, data and analytics, improve lead generation and more sophisticated segmentation and we certainly believe we have opportunities to invest in all those areas. I would say specifically, in the technology and data analytics area, where we have made great strides. And we see a lot of opportunities for increasing fairly dramatically the productivity and efficiency of our agencies and their personnel their licensed sales professionals. , : The fourth area I talked about was more competitively priced than higher value products using different pricing techniques and better underwriting to improve those rates. And we see an opportunity to invest some of these money in a few areas to both improve the value of the products and ease of understanding those products and selling those products. And so we intend to use data and analytics to do a lot of pre-fill, to do some propensity modeling, to help customers understand what other customers like them tend to purchase to help them make intelligent choices about the options and features in the product. And we see a lot of our opportunity to go from just offering really solid value products to doing it in a way that is remarkably easy and effective for our customers. And the fifth area I talked about last quarter was driving more quotes with more segment in marketing. And we certainly expect to invest some of the additional money in marketing, but it\u2019s not just throwing more money at the same marketing media. It\u2019s using increased segmentation, focusing on digital marketing capabilities, social media and some of the tools available to us now to enable us to better target their right customer for us. So there\u2019s a wealth of different ways to invest this money to stimulate growth in the business. And we believe it\u2019s a complex system. We don\u2019t believe any one single lever is ever effective in stimulating long-term growth, and we expect to pull as many levers as we possibly can to stimulate growth at the right level of margin to create long-term profitable growth. Paul Newsome : So is it fair that sort of one, two and three and five would be something that will be show up in the expense ratio, and I guess forward show open in the loss ratio? Or be more competitive products? Matt Winter : Well, certainly, increased investments could show up in the expense ratio, assuming you\u2019re not able to sell funding. But a lot of the work that we\u2019re doing is increasing productivity and efficiency in a way that allows us actually to improve our expense ratio and then reinvest some of those savings in othertechniques to drive growth. So some of it will potentially show up in increased expenses, but not necessarily one for one in the expense ratio and don\u2019t forget, expense ratio is just that. It\u2019s a ratio. So the more we\u2019re able to grow the denominator, the less pressure there is on the ratio itself. As far as the loss ratio, our expectation is that we made tremendous improvement over the last several years in our ability to manage loss costs both through very good improvements in the claims operations as well as in the more sophisticated underwriting techniques and segmented rates taking. We don\u2019t expect anything that we\u2019re doing to turn any of that negative. We expect to make continued improvements on the loss ratio side. Paul Newsome : Thank you. Congratulations on your retirement, and congratulations everybody on your new positions. Matt Winter : Thank you, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JP Morgan. You question, please. Sarah DeWitt : Hi, good morning. Your ROE for 2017 of 13% is very impressive, given the elevated CAT this year. What do you view is the right ROE profile going forward, given more normalized CATs, and now you have tax reform. Tom Wilson : Sarah, thank you for the comment on it. Yes, 13% is a good number. It should be in the low teens. You can decide where in the low teens that will be. Obviously, it varies by year and by about two of it, but I think as you point out an important fact, which is our homeowners business, the underwriting income was down about $400 million this year because of those high CATs, which was \u2013 we\u2019ve only had three years in the last 10, we spent about $3 billion. And so that had a big negative impact. And while we benefited, of course, from last level of frequency in auto insurance in the prior reserve releases that was a cost we had to overcome. It may or may not be during the future. I think the fact is with this balance we have between auto, home, investments, our life businesses and the other business we are starting, it should create overall, profitable growth and give us a good ROEs. Sarah DeWitt : Okay, great. Thanks. And then just on U.S. tax reform. I\u2019m just a little confused by some of the comments. I guess how much of tax reform do you expect to drop to the bottom line? Because on the one hand, you say the future on filings will be impacted, but then on the other hand, you say that to be immaterial. So will that and to build that benefit drop to the bottom line? Tom Wilson : Well \u2013 first, there\u2019s not really any specific number, right? Because you\u2019re talking about a system where there\u2019s all kinds of different components. So it\u2019s not like it just goes through. Think of taxes as expenses if you want to think about it that way. And Matt talked about how we have were cutting expenses in some areas to invest in other things like marketing and distribution. Just think of this as another expense reduction. And that\u2019s so some of it we can invest in marketing, some of it we can invest in margin. It really just depends. We\u2019re trying to toggle between maximizing shareholder value between profit and growth. And clearly, we think that the best way to drive shareholder value in 2018 is by growing because we like where our returns are. So to accept some of it came through to the bottom line, that will be good for shareholders. We feel confident about our results, which is why we increased the dividend by 24%. I was actually kind of disappointed that none of the early stuff will regrow back to 24%. I\u2019m like, \"Hey, what happened to the dividend?\" But \u2013 so we feel good about the business and the returns that will generate. Sarah DeWitt : .: Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, good morning. My first question is on the underlying margin target. If we look at the difference between the old segmentation and the current segmentation, that was about a 70 basis point impact on 2017. So do you effectively \u2013 if we add that back then, is the 86% to 88% more or less in line with the target where you saw 2017 at the start of last year? And then combined with that, when you think about and you come to this 86% to 88% target, could you walk us through how you\u2019re thinking about the deterioration that you could see in both the underlying loss ratio or the expense ratio as you came up with that holistic number? Mario Rizzo : So thanks, Elyse. This is Mario. So first, the 86% to 88% is a total Property-Liability number. It\u2019s not unique to anyone of the businesses. I think when you look at it compared to the 87% to 89% over a year ago, it \u2013 we do expect improvement relative to the guidance we would have given you a year ago. Some of that is because of the continued profit improvement in some of the businesses that we\u2019ve been working on profitability for the last several years. That would include Encompass and Esurance as well as our commercial business. So we factored that all in, and the outcome is the 86% to 88% that we gave you. And as Tom mentioned earlier on, we think at that level, with an outlook for accelerating growth, we can generate significant shareholder value operating the business at those levels. Tom Wilson : Let me just make a quick comment about the frequency. So remember, in 2016, frequency jumped way up. We were all surprised. We got on it early, and we went to written prices. Previously came way down in 2017. So we haven\u2019t forgotten about that volatility when we\u2019re doing our estimates. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. And then I know some of the questions that are all in the call did focus on the impact of tax reform and potentially on rate filings. But maybe this a little bit backwards-looking, but the level of rate that you guys took in the fourth quarter did go up a little bit even if you exclude the rate that you \u2013 x kind of a rate increase that you guys took in California. I had thought that we might see a little bit of a slowdown in the rate level. Was there anything specific to the Q4, and just how we should be thinking about the level of rate you guys see yourself taking in 2018? Glenn Shapiro : Elyse, this is Glenn. You\u2019re right. It was heavily influenced by California, the higher rate in the fourth quarter. And that rate is effective now and in process. So we continue to look at our rates on a state-by-state basis. And going back to the question which you went into on taxes, that the \u2013 only the profit component is impacted by the tax changes. And we look on state-by-state basis. And we have indications in states. This will be good for customers. It helps mitigate the indications, but it doesn\u2019t eliminate them. And we also factor in loss trend, which in and of itself is, every year, a larger factor than the tax change that we had. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. So you see yourself, I guess, similar commentary to last quarter, with a little adjustment for tax reform as more or less taking weight in line with trend? Matt Winter : Elyse, it\u2019s Matt. Let me just add one thing. You made a comment about the deterioration in the margin that you saw in the fourth quarter. I would just encourage you to go back over the last however many years you\u2019d like to, three, five, ten years. And I think what you\u2019ll notice is that there is almost always historically an increase in the underlying loss ratio in the fourth quarter typically due to bad weather patterns that we see in fourth quarter and first quarter. And I think what you\u2019ll find is that our actual performance this last quarter from both an underlying loss ratio and underlying combined ratio was actually quite good. So we don\u2019t look at that as a deterioration in our underlying margin, we look at that as normal seasonality and volatility in that area. In the expense component you also referred to, you\u2019ll also see that following really good years, you will see a spike-up in the expense ratio in the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s typically due to our true-ups of our agent bonus plans and our employee incentive compensation plans. So that tends to be somewhat volatile. It\u2019s not a deterioration in our expense efficiency in the business, it\u2019s just reflecting a true-up in some things as a result of having a good year. So I would, if I were you, look at fourth quarter as a negative. In any way, we view it as a strong quarter with good strong fundamentals in both areas. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Than you very much. I appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Yaron Kinar : Good morning everybody. Sorry to beat a dead horse here, but I want to go back to the guidance for the underlying combined ratio. So if we take the midpoint of that guidance, it\u2019s about 200 basis points higher than the total results for 2017. And if I understand the comments that you made on the call correctly, really a lot of the acceleration of expense initiatives would be offset by improved productivity. Some of the loss ratio increases could be offset by some of the loss control that you\u2019ve put in the last couple of years. So what would drive that 200 basis point increase? Is it basically frequency? Tom Wilson : Well, first, let\u2019s make sure we get everyone there. So if there\u2019s still questions out here, we feel very comfortable we can be in the 86% to 88%. We\u2019ve picked a range that we feel is reasonable, one that we can live with then. We don\u2019t necessarily pick it just by the midpoint. So that\u2019s where want to be. We just said we want to be in that range. If you look at frequency last year, it was down 4% to 5%, depending on where you want to look at it. If you look at where were in 2015, you can get the same part of that. And so that translates directly almost \u2013 percentage into \u2013 it\u2019s probably about \u2013 I guess, it\u2019s \u2013 about 75% of it shows up in the combined ratio. So you can get year-to-year swing on frequency. Just bad weather, people getting more actions, the whole with an increased miles driven, the new cell phones, what was in 2015, we know that they happened everywhere around the country. We know other people were impacted by it as well. And so I don\u2019t think anybody can really do attribution on exactly why it happened. So I would just say that it\u2019s normal volatility in there. But I think the broader message is we feel really good about where our profitability is right now, and we think the right way to drive shareholder value is through growth. And we think \u2013 so you won\u2019t see as many price increases that\u2019s come up next year because at these kind of margins, it\u2019s a very high return on required capital for us. And we can drive a lot of shareholder value by growing our business here. You\u2019re starting to see that in the \u2013 particularly in the Allstate brand in auto insurance in the fourth quarter, which we started earlier in the year. So you\u2019re now starting to see that come through. It hasn\u2019t turned into year-over-year growth, but I believe we\u2019re headed in that direction if we can keep retention where it is, we keep driving new business. So this is about shareholder value. I think if you just want to get focused on profitability and not think about growth and shareholder value, then I would say probably the better place to go is to look at the trade-out between auto and homeowners insurance. And as I said, auto insurance profitability was up this year. If you\u2019re worried about that, look at homeowner profitability. When you add in CAT, then you get the total profitability. We use underlying combined ratio just to give you a sense for how well do we think the business is running. It is typically a two point range. Sometimes, with one year or two years, we move to a three-point range because the market was a little more volatile, and we weren\u2019t sure how many price increases we can get. But two points is the range we think we can live with then. Yaron Kinar : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And if I could ask one more question about tax reform and the impact on the profit provision component of rate filings. So if I understand correctly, ultimately, in most cases, you actually file for a rate increase that is lower than the profit provision. Is that true? And if so, wouldn\u2019t it mean that tax reform ultimately would have very little impact on the actual ability to push forward rate increases if it were necessary? Tom Wilson : I\u2019m not sure I was with you on file for rate increase lower than the profit provision. What do you mean by that? Yaron Kinar : So I think in most cases, you have an indicated rate that is dependent on the profit provision. Tom Wilson : I understand what you\u2019re saying. So first, it\u2019s just that we operate in 50 states, and each of those states has its own regulatory environment. There was a good report done, I think, earlier this week or last week on which states are in which category. And so some are very restrictive and really look tough, hardheaded. Others, it\u2019s sort of an open market and you go to compete. In those ones that are very restrictive, you have indications of rates. And sometimes, you file for the whole indication. Sometimes, you get less than that because you\u2019re in a negotiation with the regulator as to what to do. So I would say, you\u2019re correct, and that it is a \u2013 it\u2019s more complex than, \"Oh, I\u2019m going to take your underwriting margin.\" Time has changed in tax rate and say, \"That\u2019s what happens to your premium.\" Much more complex than that. It\u2019s what we want to take, what the competitive situation is, where the regulatory environment is, where loss costs are, what trends are. It\u2019s a complicated little piece. We have 300 different companies and state combinations. And the bottom line is, we feel okay about where we\u2019re at. We think, with this tax law, it gives us an opportunity to invest in growth. We think that\u2019s really good for our shareholders. And so we\u2019re excited about this, not concerned about it. Yaron Kinar : Thank you very much for the color. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Your question please. Bob Glasspiegel : Good morning. And Matt Congratulations on your retirement. A quick question on looking back to 2017, if we could just have one more look at sort of your underlying combined ratio versus target, which came in a couple points better. It sounds like, in your answer to Yaron\u2019s question, frequency was a big surprise, but what else sort of surprised you about the year relative to where you were setting it up? Matt Winter : Thanks Bob, it\u2019s Matt. Well, we\u2019ve had frequency surprise us when it\u2019s been positive, had frequency surprise us when it\u2019s been negative. The frequency improvement was due this year to a lot of the things that are external and some things that are internal. So externally, the industry has experienced a decline in frequency. And we look at it with the same level of rigor that we looked at it when it went up. So it\u2019s consistent across risk segments. It\u2019s consistent geographically across rating plans, across customer tenure and accident types. So both quality and tenure of the customers appears to not be driving that. But when we reacted to the frequency spike at the end of 2014, 2015 and early part of 2016, you recall that we took segmented rate. And because we took segmented rate, we impacted the riskier sections and segments of our book more than others. That increased defection rates of those underperforming segments. We did drive lower levels of new business that actually reduced the new business penalty. And at the same time, we improved the rate adequacy of all the business that we drove. So it\u2019s the combination of the decline externally and some of the actions we took internally that really improved our frequency results. And you see that \u2013 if you look at fast track, you can see us following industry better than industry trends. So we\u2019ve been at least 0.5 lower than the industry for PD frequency in each of the last quarters, the last four quarters. So we\u2019re not seeing anything dramatically different than the rest of the industry, but I think we are benefiting a little better than everybody else from it. We also, in addition to frequency, remember that there was a whole lot of good work done in the claims organization to manage severity costs and loss costs through some of the work that they did with QuickFoto Claim, enhance discipline and diligence around bodily injury requiring enhanced documentation. And things like that and the result of all of that work has resulted in an improvement in our overall underlying combined ratio. And we see nothing to indicate that, that should be different for us going forward other than normal volatility that\u2019s environmental. But internally, the same stuff that\u2019s worked for us in the past should work for us going forward. John Griek : Jonathan we\u2019ll take one more question. Operator : Certainly. final question comes from the line of Joshua Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question please. Joshua Shanker : Yes. Thank your for fitting me on. I appreciate it. I just want to clarify, on Elyse\u2019s question, the 86% to 88% guidance compares to an 84.9% in 2017 or an 856.% in 2017? Mario Rizzo : Josh this is Mario. The comparable number would have been the 84.9%. That\u2019s on the same basis that the 87% to 89% was established. The 86% to 88% is based on the new segments. Joshua Shanker : And I guess, tangentially, can you tell us the difference in customer acquisition spend between 4Q 2017 and 4Q 2016, maybe that will help inform us about how much you\u2019re willing to spend on acquiring new business in 2018. Tom Wilson : Well, we don\u2019t break \u2013 we don\u2019t disclose customer acquisition cost per policy. We obviously track it and use it. I mean, we just talk about marketing expenses. So in the fourth quarter expenses were up a little bit in part because of the foundation and the agency Matt talked about and it\u2019s probably even if you across the agency comp pressed here is probably about 7.0 point, something like that. And so we wouldn\u2019t expect that to continue at that level. That said, we are going to increase marketing in 2018 when we reposition our brand. I feel like our advertising needs to be refreshed a little bit. And so we\u2019re working on that for both the Allstate and Esurance brands. When we do that, we will invest in more marketing. What I can tell you, Josh, is that it\u2019s all economics. So we don\u2019t spend money to drive to drive growth to lose money. We will accept a higher loss ratio on some new business until it ages out. So we can end up running a combined ratio loss business for our first year in both businesses, both Allstate and Esurance. But we don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s all economic. We\u2019re all going to get quick returns on it. So the \u2013 I think the point on sort of where are you, we were down a lot in frequency in 2017. We\u2019d like to think this is a new level, and that our pricing that we\u2019ve put in place 2015 and 2016 which reflected higher frequency, was no longer necessary. And if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019re going to offer our customers a better deal. We can capture margin and we can grow which is our shareholder value. But the fact of the matter is, you don\u2019t know.  And so I think the message we would like you to take away from 86% to 88% is that we feel good about the business. We feel good about the profitability of the business. We have good control over the profitability of the business to react to different things that happen in the marketplace. And the best thing to do is to keep profitability in that range and grow the business as opposed to drive the profitability lower. Obviously, you could \u2013 we could have an alternative plan, which will be to driver the underlying combined ratio down further. We do not think that\u2019s the right way to interact shareholder value and the company. We think we\u2019ve gotten ourselves through the dramatic increase in frequency in 2015 and 2016 and it\u2019s time to grow again. So let me just close by, we had \u2013 we talked and believe this is great operating results. We\u2019re positioned for growth. We have a 24% increase in the dividend and shareholders continue to get repurchased cash as well, which positions us in a positive light. And we have a bright future. So thanks very much. Have a great quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Allstate First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I would like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. John Griek - The Allstate Corp.: Well, thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome everyone to Allstate's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks by our Chairman, President and CEO, Tom Wilson; Chief Financial Officer, Mario Rizzo and me, we will have a question-and-answer session. Also here are Steve Shebik, our Vice-Chair, Glenn Shapiro, the President of Allstate Personal Lines, Don Civgin, the President of Service Businesses, John Dugenske, our Chief Investment and Corporate Strategy Officer; Mary Jane Fortin, President of our Life, Retirement, and Benefit businesses, and Eric Ferren, our Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Yesterday following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, along with an update to our 2018 reinsurance program, filed our 10-Q for the first quarter and posted the results presentation we will use this morning in conjunction with our prepared remarks. These documents are available on our website at allstateinvestors.com. As noted on the first slide, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2017, the slides and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. This discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release or our investor supplement. We are recording this call and a replay will be available following its conclusion. And as always, I will be able to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call. And now I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Well, good morning. Thank you for joining us and staying current on Allstate's operating results. Let's begin on slide 2. So we had excellent execution of the operating plan which increased growth and profitability in the first quarter. We also benefited from an unexpected decline in auto accident frequency, lower catastrophe losses and a reduction in federal taxes. Net income was $946 million or $2.63 a share with adjusted net income of $1.07 billion or $2.96 per share. Adjusted net income return on equity was 15%. In the table, you can see revenues grew 3.4% on the Property-Liability insurance premiums. Net investment income also increased on good performance-based result. If you move to slide 3, we're making good progress on all of our five 2018 Operating Priorities. The first three priorities \u2013 better serve our customers, achieve targeted economic returns on capital, and grow the customer base are intertwined to ensure that profitable long-term growth creates shareholder value. We made progress on better serving customers as the Net Promoter Score increased, the customer retention improved from both the Allstate and Esurance brands which is a key driver of growth. Returns on shareholder capital were also strong. The Property-Liability reported combined ratio of 88.0, generated $959 million in underwriting income for the quarter which was an increase of $411 million from the prior-year quarter. Auto insurance underwriting income increased for all three underwritten brands and Allstate brand homeowners insurance continued to generate substantial income and benefited from lower catastrophe losses. Allstate Life and Allstate Benefits also generated attractive returns in part due to lower taxes. Going to the third one, grow customer base, Allstate brand policies in force increased as the auto and other personal lines grew over the prior-year quarter. Esurance policies increased on growth in the homeowners line. Allstate Benefits continued its long track record of growth with policies in force increasing 6.7% and SquareTrade policies grew 11.9 million or nearly 40% compared to the prior-year quarter. Investment income increased due to continued strong results from the performance-based portfolio. A total return on the $83 billion portfolio was a negative 50 basis points which included a stable contribution of about 1% from net investment income but that was more than offset by lower fixed income valuations and a decline in equity markets. Lastly, we're also committed to building long-term growth platforms. SquareTrade is making good progress on the objectives supporting the acquisition and Arity is helping to drive the expansion of Allstate and Esurance's telematics utilization. Let's go to slide 4, it shows the Property-Liability segment results by customer segment and brand. Starting with the table at the top, net written premium was $7.8 billion, a 5% increase from the prior-year quarter. The reported combined ratio of 88.0 was 4.9 points better than first quarter of 2017 due to lower catastrophe losses, increased premiums earned, and lower auto accident frequency that was partially offset by higher operating costs and lower favorable prior-year reserve reestimates. When catastrophes and prior-year reserve reestimates are excluded, the underlying combined ratio was 84.2 for the first quarter of 2018. As you know, our strategy is to provide differentiated customer value propositions for the four consumer segments in the personal lines insurance market. The Allstate brands in the lower left competes in the local advice and branded segments. Net written premium was 5.2% higher than the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior-year quarter. The underlying combined ratio was 83.2, slightly above the prior-year quarter as continued improvement in auto insurance was offset by an increase in the homeowners insurance. Esurance in the lower right serves customers who prefer our branded product but are comfortable handling their own insurance needs. Esurance net written premiums was 7.9% compared to the prior-year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 98.4 was 1.8 points better than the prior-year quarter with improvements in both auto and homeowners insurance. Encompass in the upper left competes for customers who want local advice and are less concerned about the brand of insurance they purchase so they mostly go through independent agencies. Premium declined due to the net impact of improving underlying margins. The underlying combined ratio was 87.9, up 1.3 points as we invest in building capabilities to support profitable growth. John will now go through these Property-Liability results in more detail. John Griek - The Allstate Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Slide 5 shows the underlying drivers of policies in force for Allstate brand auto insurance. Starting with the graph at the top, overall policies in force grew by 52,000 or 0.3% in the first quarter of 2018. The bottom two charts highlight our balanced approach to growing the business. The renewal ratio of 88.3 was an improvement of 0.9 points from the prior-year quarter, benefiting from our continued focus on the customer experience and a stable rate environment. New issued applications grew year-over-year for the 5th consecutive quarter, increasing 17% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Growth in new business is due to improved competitive position, increased agency productivity and the expansion of the agency footprint. Let's go to slide 6 to cover the underwriting results for Allstate brand auto insurance. Starting with the top left graph, the recorded combined ratio for the first Quarter was 88.5, 2.2 points lower than the prior-year quarter and generated $579 million in underwriting income. The primary drivers of profitability improvement were increased average written premium, lower frequency and lower catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 90.0 in the first quarter of 2018 improved 0.9 points compared to the first quarter of 2017, driven by a 1.8 point improvement in the underlying loss ratio. The expense ratio of 25.0 was 0.9 points above the prior-year quarter due to higher agent and employee-related compensation costs. The chart on the top right highlights the drivers of the Allstate brand auto underlying combined ratio. Annualized average premium shown by the blue line, increased 4% to $1,029 while underlying loss and expense shown by the red line increased 3% to $926. This resulted in a favorable gap of $103 per policy. The positive gap between these two trends widened in the first quarter based on lower accident frequency, partially offset by higher severity and expenses. The bottom left chart on this page provides Allstate brand auto property damage, gross frequency and paid severity results indexed to 2013. In the first quarter, property damage gross frequency declined 2.5% compared to the prior-year quarter and favorable trends remain geographically widespread. After experiencing a sharp increase in accident frequency in 2015 and 2016, trends have improved. And as of the first quarter of 2018, property damage gross frequency is performing in line with levels experienced in 2014. While frequency has declined, property damage paid severity has experienced average annual increases of 4.3% since 2013. The chart on the bottom right shows the quarterly trends for bodily injury paid frequency and severity. As you can see, these statistics can be volatile, given the timing between opening and settling claims as well as the impact of internal process changes. Given this volatility, we will no longer provide bodily injury paid statistics, beginning next quarter. We will be reviewing other measures that could explain economic results on this longer tail coverage. Slide 7 shows the operating results for Allstate brand homeowners. The top part of the page provides detail on profitability. Homeowners' returns were good, with a recorded combined ratio of 80.8 in the first quarter, 12.9 points better than the prior-year quarter due to lower catastrophe losses. Performance for this line is better evaluated over a 12-month period, given weather seasonality and variability. Allstate brand homeowners insurance generated $949 million of underwriting income over the last 12 months. The bottom half of the page provides detail on policies in force. On the lower left, the renewal ratio of 87.5 was 0.4 points higher than the first quarter of 2017 and new issued applications growth accelerated to 14.7%. On the lower right, you can see the size of this line of business, which generates $6.9 billion of premium from 6.1 million policies. Slide 8 provides financial highlights for Esurance. Esurance generated a combined ratio below 100 in the first quarter and policies in force grew. The recorded combined ratio of 99.3 in the first quarter, shown on the left chart, was 3.1 points below the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by increased premiums earned and lower catastrophe losses, partially offset by increased loss costs. Esurance growth trends are highlighted on the right chart. Net written premiums continue to grow on increased average premium and policy growth. Policies in force increased 1.1% compared to the first quarter of 2017 after being relatively flat since 2015, which followed a period of rapid growth. This quarter's growth was driven by homeowners' policies, as auto policies in force were essentially flat to the prior-year. Slide 9 provides additional highlights for Encompass. Encompass continues to execute its profit improvement plan. Encompass's recorded combined ratio was 98.4 in the first quarter of 2018, 13.3 points lower than the prior-year, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 87.9 for the first quarter was 1.3 points higher than the prior-year period as a higher expense ratio more than offset improvement in the underlying loss ratio. Shown on the right chart, Encompass's trailing 12 month net written premium declined 8.2% and policies in force were 12.8% lower in 2018. Planned reductions in states and local markets with inadequate returns has impacted overall topline trends. Now, I'll turn it over to Mario. Mario Rizzo - The Allstate Corp.: Thanks, John. Let's go to slide 10, which provides detail on the service businesses. In the first quarter, revenue growth accelerated to $313 million and policies in force reached 46.5 million. The adjusted net loss was $5 million in the quarter, a $5 million improvement over the prior-year quarter as favorable loss experience at SquareTrade was partially offset by investments in research and business expansion at Arity. As you can see on the right, SquareTrade revenues were $122 million or $63 million above the prior-year but $30 million of that was due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. Revenues from the other businesses were flat to prior-year. SquareTrade also made progress on the three objectives supporting its acquisition in January 2017, as you can see from the box at the bottom of the slide. Policies in force grew to 41.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 11.9 million over the prior-year quarter, largely from domestic customers. Improved loss experience led to adjusted net income of $2 million in the quarter compared to an $8 million loss in the first quarter of 2017. The transition of underwriting risks to Allstate paper is essentially complete and continued progress is being made expanding European cellphone protection policies. Turning to slide 11, let's review our Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuities results. Allstate Life generated attractive returns on capital. Adjusted net income, shown in the top left chart, of $69 million in the first quarter increased $10 million compared to the prior-year quarter. This is primarily due to a lower effective tax rate and higher premiums and contract charges, partially offset by adverse mortality. Allstate Benefits' adjusted net income, shown on the top middle chart on the page, was $28 million. The $6 million increase from the prior-year quarter was due to higher premiums and contract charges and the lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher contract benefits. Allstate Benefits continued its strong track record of growth, with premiums and contract charges, shown on the bottom middle chart, increasing 6.3% compared to the first quarter of 2017 and policies in force growth of 6.7%. Allstate Annuities, on the far right, had adjusted net income of $35 million in the quarter and continued to benefit from good performance-based investment results. Economic returns remain low, due to the relatively high regulatory capital requirements. Slide 12 highlights our investment results. The chart at the top of the slide provides our asset allocation over time. We proactively manage our investment portfolio based on our long-term strategic risk profile, relevant market conditions and corporate risk appetite. We have increased the portfolio's equity allocation in response to historically-low market yields and to utilize available risk capacity. Our performance-based investments which now total $7.7 billion or 9% of the portfolio are expected to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns. In the lower left, net investment income for the first quarter was $786 million, 5.1% or $38 million higher than the first quarter of 2017. Market-based investment income, shown in blue, was stable. Performance-based investment income, shown in gray, was the primary driver of the increase over 2017 generating $181 million of income in the first quarter. Performance-based income was lower than the prior three quarters which benefited from outperformance by certain investments. The components of total return on our diversified $83 billion portfolio are shown in the table on the lower right. The return was slightly negative in the quarter, reflecting lower fixed income valuations due to increased market yields and a decline in equity markets. The 12-month trailing return was 3.8%. With the adoption of the fair value accounting standard during the quarter, changes in the valuation of public equity securities are now a component of realized capital gains and losses as opposed to unrealized gains and losses. Slide 13 provides an overview of our capital strength and financial flexibility. Our capital position is excellent. We delivered strong returns, increased book value and maintained a conservative financial position while increasing shareholders' ownership in the company by reducing the number of outstanding shares. Adjusted net income return on equity was 15% for the 12 months ended March 31, 2018 an increase of 3.1 points compared to the prior-year period and book value per common share increased 11.9% to $58.64. We returned $465 million to common shareholders in the first quarter. This included repurchasing 3.5 million shares of our common stock for $333 million, leaving $935 million remaining on our current repurchase program. We paid $132 million in common shareholder dividends. As a reminder, the board of directors approved a 24% increase in the quarterly dividend per common share to $0.46, which was paid on April 2 and is not included in the amount returned in the first quarter. We continually look to optimize our capital structure and in the first quarter we issued $575 million of perpetual preferred stock and $500 million of senior notes. The proceeds of these issuances are for general corporate purposes, including the redemption, repayment or repurchase of certain outstanding securities. Now, I will ask Jonathan to open the line for questions. Operator : Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for the call and taking my questions. I suppose the most obvious place to start would be just around the underlying combined ratio guidance for the year considering that the first quarter result was substantially better than what your annual target is, I'm curious if your thinking has changed or what your perspective about that is? And also in the context of generating that really attractive result, I'm curious about what your view is on product positioning and competitive positioning in the marketplace? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Greg, this is Tom. I'll start and then maybe Glenn can add color to that as well. So first, thanks for the question. Good morning. Based on the three months results, it's too soon to change the underlying combined ratio guidance. The returns we earned on auto insurance are really good even at the outlook range and the best way to increase shareholder value at that point is to grow policies in force. We're obviously, as you point out, at below the low end of the range in the first quarter and that was really due to an unexpected decline in auto accident frequency versus the prior year. It looks like other companies experienced similar declines in the first quarter but our guidance is based on only a really small sample of the overall industry. Our projections did assume that there would be an increase in auto accident frequency. And as you well know, auto accident frequency has been very volatile over the last three years. It increased significantly in 2015 and 2016 and then decreased in 2017. Actually you can see that on John's slide. And, of course, the underlying drivers of frequency are miles driven, economic activity, how many people are working, weather, all of which are difficult to predict individually, in combination and doing it geographically is nearly impossible. And so at this point, we're not changing our frequency outlook for the whole year or our underlying combined ratio guidance. But let me give you a couple of math points as well. Auto frequency is usually highest in the fourth quarter. In the second half of the year, it has three more days than the first half of the year and one calendar day has over half a point of impact on the quarterly loss ratio, all other things being equal. So the returns we get are really good at any level. And so we're focused on maintaining that and growing. Our competitive position, Glenn can talk about it although I would say from my standpoint, the best way to analyze competitive position is your retention levels in your new business, and both are good. Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: Yeah, thanks Tom. And Greg, good question. On competitive position, we feel good about where we are from all the metrics we looked at. We monitor our competitive position in every state and every market across the country. And if you look at how we're growing right now, we're growing in a pretty balanced way. As Tom said, we're retaining more of our customers \u2013 always best to retain the ones we fought hard to attract in the first place and our new business is up. With the new business up, if we were getting the same number of quotes but significantly increasing our close rate, you'd look at it and think that we broadened appetite or something in the way that we got it. But from a competitive standpoint, we're just getting a lot of looks at people. We're getting a lot of quotes. Our quotes are well up. We're closing an appropriate amount of those so our competitive position feels like we're in good shape. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for that answer. Just as a follow-up, I know you mentioned in your comments about your emphasis on your agency and distribution force. And I was looking at some of the statistics on, I guess, it's page 11 of your supplement. And you talk about Allstate agencies, and it looked like it was down sequentially a little bit. License sales agencies, sales professionals and Allstate independent agencies. Maybe you could just provide some color around which of those buckets you expect to grow over the course of the next year or two and which may be deemphasized? Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: All right. Yeah, Greg, I'm glad you pointed that out. Because I really think the way to look at this is on a year-over-year basis. We've been committed for several quarters. We've been talking about growing our distribution footprint and I think we are effectively growing the distribution footprint. If you look year-over-year, we're up about 1200 points of presence. 100 agents, 1200 licensed sales professionals. When you look at this, much like a lot of our other results, there's a little bit of a seasonality to it. At the end of the year, a lot of folks are running to get some people in place. The pipeline dries up a little bit. We tend to have higher turnover in the first quarter, but the first quarter of this year, our turnover was less than what we anticipated. So that was favorable. So as you look at a starting point at the end of first quarter last year to now, we got 1200 more points of presence; a little bit down sequentially but we're really always down sequentially at that. We're less down than we would have anticipated at this point. So, as we build throughout the year and we continue to look to increase our distribution footprint, we're starting from a good foundation. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you for your answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Your question, please. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. I guess, first, I was hoping \u2013 could you just elaborate a bit on what drove the unexpected decline in auto frequency and do you have any view on what that could look like going forward? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Sarah, this is Tom. So, it's really too early to tell what the drivers of it would be. When we look at a variety of items, there's no one thing that pops out in your mind. Obviously, weather would have some impact in the first quarter and there is different kinds of weather in different parts of the country. Secondly, when we look at miles driven, it's actually up a little bit when we look at our driveway data so that wouldn't automatically lead you to conclude that it should be down. In fact, it would be the opposite of that so we don't have a good read now. And oftentimes even in reverse-looking at 2015 and 2016, it's hard to determine attribution between specific elements. What we do know is that it was down and obviously we've reserved well so we're feeling good about where the profitability of the business is but we also know that if it goes up, we're still positioned to be very attractive returns in the business. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just on the performance-based investment income that declined quarter-over-quarter, how should we be thinking about modeling a good run rate for that? John Edward Dugenske - Allstate Insurance Co.: Yeah. Hi, Sarah, it's John Dugenske. Thank you for asking the question. First, I wouldn't view the quarterly decline as meaningful. If you think about how we own these assets generally, we own these sets versus longer-tailed liabilities. The performance has been consistent with what we've hoped to achieve with the allocation over time. Looking at a little more detail, in any given quarter, you may get a specific event, a transaction where something's liquidated, a particular performance of an individual investment that may make those returns a little bit volatile. I would encourage you to smooth the data and look at multiple quarters and look at the overall trend. Notably in the fourth quarter of last year, we had a number of very positive events. Three liquidations of deals that just as well could have taken place this quarter but took place in the fourth quarter that gave us a very good fourth quarter number along with some other things. So, overall, the trend is in place and we feel good about it. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So, just in terms of modeling that, $200 million or so is a good run rate? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Sarah, you might look at it as on a yield basis and on a rolling basis. So \u2013 I know that's hard to stick into a quarterly number but John is being a little humble. We had great results in quarters 2, 3 and 4 last year that the yield on their portfolio, if you just took income over the balance was in the mid-teens, but we do not... Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Expect it to be in the mid-teens on that kind of level. We expect it to be above where you would get from public equities, so I think you really have to look at it on that basis (28:29) and we tend to think about it relative to the overall company in terms of volatility. I know you're looking at individual lines, but catastrophes bounce around, performance-based income bounces around, what we seek to do is to increase total long-term return despite the fact that it bounces around. In fact that it does bounce around gives us the opportunity. We have the ability to enable and handle that volatility; gives us the ability to earn better returns. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, and good morning. Just first question, just a follow-up on the frequency questions. I just wondered if you could quantify the delta between the results versus your expectations? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Kai, we don't give out the subcomponents of our expectations, because then we end up spending a whole bunch of time talking about assumptions which \u2013 on things like frequency, it's always an estimate. It's even harder to look backwards and determine why it happened so we don't give out the subcomponents. Glenn, maybe you can talk a little bit about the absolute decline in frequency and where we saw it and that will give Kai some additional color. Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: Yeah, so we saw \u2013 obviously, we saw the decline in frequency. One way to look at this is as you compare to sort of the broader trends, so we clearly have wind at our backs when it comes to frequency; it's down. Our frequency appears to be down as you look over the last few quarters, a little more than the industry and some of that is as our book shrunk a little bit, we got to a little bit higher quality on average of the book of business. In terms of just longer-term trends, there's a lot it, as Tom said, it's hard to predict. There's a lot of different theories on there between miles driven, miles driven per operator, safety features in cars, so we'll continue to monitor that going forward. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: So, yeah and I think, Glenn, it's very broad-based geographically decline in frequency this quarter by accident-type. It was down in most of the accident types. The tenure of the customer was down across all tenures of customers so it wasn't just one state, one group of customers. It was broad-based, which, as Glenn said, leads us to conclude that other people had the same thing but we don't know that for sure. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So just to clarify, you still expect positive frequency through the remaining of the year? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Kai, we haven't changed our underlying combined ratio outlook for the year, would be the way I would say that. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. And then my second question is on more sort of a like high-level. If you \u2013 there's a recent IPO on the personal line brokerage and they're looking into sort of growing very rapidly in the multicarrier platform independent agency model. You \u2013 Allstate have the platform that encompass all these different distribution model but the captive agency distribution is still the majority of the revenue as well as income. How do you feel about the captive model over the long run? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: We like the Allstate agency model for a number of reasons. First, it gives us the ability to have the right price value comparison. When you're in the independent agency channel, you often get spreadsheeted (32:02) comparative rater and it's harder to maintain consistency in your pricing. Secondly, the captive channel gives us the ability to really control the customer experience, which is really important when you're delivering value. And as we head into telematics, it gives us an ability to build even greater relationships because people will be more connected with us. That said, we think there is a place in our portfolio for all the businesses. So we like to do it direct with Esurance. We'd like to grow Encompass. We wanted to get its profitability right and get its capabilities positioned which is I mentioned we're working on. So we'd like to grow in that channel as well. And, of course, we have a platform which we believe is the biggest in the industry right now, called Answer Financial, which is an electronic version of an independent agency. And it's got a very strong position and we're continuing to build up that model, leaning into telematics on that piece as well. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your question, please. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. As the Allstate brands auto policies in force are now growing, how can the company make sure it doesn't become impacted by the new business penalty where the margins for the new business tend to be somewhat lower than legacy business? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Well, Jay, you're correct in that, particularly in the preferred customer segment, there tends to be a new business penalty where you earn less money on a new customer than you would on somebody who has been around for seven or eight years. And so that is basically endemic to the industry and of growth. What I would say is I would maybe take your question \u2013 it's really not possible not to be impacted by that. But what I would say is we feel comfortable that we know how to manage growth and overall profitability to be able to increase shareholder value by both growing and maintaining margins. And Glenn mentioned this. We run the business at a local level. So we're looking at it by state, by product line, by risk class. We slice and dice it every which way, so to the extent that the growth would not be properly priced in certain places, we would obviously be able to \u2013 we'd see that and would react accordingly. And then I would also say the increasing use of telematics also helps us get even more accurate in our pricing. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's helpful. Thanks. On the investment side, I guess I was a little surprised that the market base, essentially the fixed income investment portfolio, investment income that that generates was down year-over-year and then also versus the prior quarter. I thought with higher interest rates, that could be rising. What am I missing there? John Edward Dugenske - Allstate Insurance Co.: Yeah, Jay, it's John again, thanks for the question. I would encourage you to take a look at the portfolio as a whole and think about how income has been generated that way. There are a number of dynamics going on in market base. First, as our performance-based assets increase, our market-based assets decrease. So there's just a lower base by which it can generate income. Second, the asset mix, within our market-based assets, changes. So, generally, we've used high-yield and other higher yielding assets within market-based to fund our performance-based assets. So, lower balance and lower high-yielding assets will decrease that. Another thing to think about is just how does the book react to higher interest rates? Think about Allstate, real simply, it's two different. Our Life and Annuities business, which generally tends to be liability-matched and where there's not a lot of new purchases. The turnover is very low. That doesn't react very quickly. Even within our protection businesses, only a small part of the portfolio would roll over in any period of time, therefore it only captures an interest rate rise gradually throughout the year. I can give you further statistics on that, but a real rough gauge would be if interest rates moved up 100 basis points across the course of the year, given turnover and everything else, expecting no other changes in the portfolio, we'd expect our yield to move up by 6 basis points or roughly $45 million to $50 million in net income. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's really helpful. Thanks very much for that. And then, just finally \u2013 I just wanted to recognize I think this is the first quarter since 2007 the company has generated over $1 billion in operating income. And at the same time, the share count has been reduced by 40%, so keep up the good work. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Thank you, Jay. I would hear that and I'm... Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Your question, please. Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : I have two unrelated questions. The first one is, there \u2013 and it's not going to be \u2013 (37:29) actually, there's a lot of private equity and other folks looking to buy blocks of Annuities, do you have any additional thoughts on your own Annuity (sic) [Annuities] (37:43) and Life book and would you be interested or you thought about some of this increased demand for people to buy some of these blocks? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: That's a really good question, Paul. The returns on capital are low for the payout annuity block versus the deferred annuity block, so we split it into two chunks. And the payout annuity block backs a lot of structured settlements, really long-dated liabilities and it is underperforming. Our approach with all of our underperforming business as you know has been to go at it multiple ways to be proactive, but to take action. And that block is about $12 billion so we're doing the same thing that we've done on all of our businesses. So just if you go back and go up a little bit, we transferred the VA block versus reinsurance in 2006. At first, we got lucky and that was before the financial markets crashed. We shut down sales of new annuities over a period of years. (38:48), so we've taken a variety of actions. What we've been doing on this one is first and foremost, getting the investments correct, so that rather than funding this block with fixed income, we've been funding portions after seven years with payout annuity or with performance-based which generates a much bigger return. That generates more capital for us and makes it less underperforming on a long-term basis. What it does on a short term basis is it makes it even more underperforming because you have to put up a whole bunch of capital for those equities even though you really shouldn't have to because the risk is big in equities, it's actually lower than the risk of being in fixed income for a long-dated liability. So what we've been doing is working with the NAIC to reduce the capital requirements and we made some progress to them to the extent we can do that, that will enable us to free up some capital. At the same time, we're also looking at how we structure those investments so we may be able to structure them in different ways so they don't have to carry as much capital. Obviously, as interest rates go up, that should help that portfolio and the lower tax rate is obviously also increased value so we've improved value in that block. We have things to do to further improve it but we're not done. And, of course, our goal is to maximize our economic value per shareholder, so we'll continue to look at all different ways to do that. Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : My second question is has there been any change on a regulatory front for the insurance business in your opinion? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: For insurance, I missed that last part, Paul? Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Just any change in the regulatory environment in the insurance business? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Well, that's a broad question. I would say there are a couple of things from a regulatory environment that we're all looking at. One is cybersecurity. The New York Department of Financial Services put out some new cybersecurity rules. We're all working hard; we would work hard anyway to make sure we're protected but we're working to make sure we have the specific elements in those specific regulations covered. Secondly, there's always the issue of privacy in data. And you're starting to see it is not yet in insurance but we're thinking about how would we deal with increased requirements on it. So as it relates to pricing, claims and a variety of things, I would say it's business as usual. Glenn, do you agree with that? Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: Yeah, I agree. There was a lot of discussion last quarter about with the tax changes and everything, but we continue to work with regulators on state-by-state basis and our filing process is business as usual. Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Montgomery. Your question, please. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Good morning, Allstate. Question on where we are in the competitive landscape which you sort of spoke about. As we look to the rest of the year, it looks like the industry came in maybe 3 points better in 2017 and your key competitors were around 103 (42:13). But if you take Allstate and Progressive out, they were at 106 (42:18). So we're trying to sort of handicap or I'm trying to handicap how your mutual competitors and travelers in Progressive are going to take the rate actions over the balance of the year. It looks like you're competing and winning on the margin but are we looking at rate increases to be more moderate by your competitors and where do you think the world is going, rate-wise? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: We don't know, Bob. I can't tell you what everybody else's plans are. We see the same numbers you see and perhaps at a greater level of granularity. So, we look at Progressive, Geico, State Farm, not only in total but by state, by risk class. We think some of that group still has some \u2013 if we were them, we would be increasing prices. I don't know what they will do given that we are not them but Glenn can talk about our rate outlook for the future, which is modest. Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: Yeah. If you look at our \u2013 where we are now, it's always dangerous to talk about this in a global level, because as Tom said, it really is state-by-state. We have great need in some places and we don't in others. Broadly-speaking, we're clearly in a better pricing and rate situation than we were a couple of years ago. I would also caution you, as you think about that, Bob, to look at what happened from the last year because a lot of what is in the results this year is what rates they took last year. So when you look at whether it's the CPI and compare to how rates are coming in in auto insurance in the first quarter, it really is the rates that were taken over the last 12 months. And so a lot of this year is already baked from whatever folks did last year in their rates and what they do this year is really more of a forward-looking basis. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : It looks like you and Progressive's margin \u2013 underwriting margin versus the industry just continues to widen year after year. I think I had it at 12 points for the two of you versus the industry last year. Is it technology pricing? You got the rates up right? What do you think sort of explains how your margin versus the industry continues to widen on a neutral basis? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah, I think, Bob, when you look over a long period of time, Progressive, Allstate and Geico, our combined ratios look to be about the same and much better than the industry. The 12 points seems like a bigger gap to me than I've seen versus the industry. But we have traditionally been at about the same zone. I think that's, in part, pricing accuracy. I think it's a different view as to what return on capital we want to get on the business, so mutual companies have a different view as to what their capital objective function is, and I think we're effective and efficient the way we do it. That would be auto insurance. What I would say on homeowners insurance is we appear to be substantially better than other people in the industry, and I don't think there's many companies with our size and scale that generate the kind of income we have. And if you look at the slide John showed, it's over $900 million of income from underwriting of our homeowners business in the last 12 months, and it's been pretty consistent like that for five or six years. So I would not ignore the benefits that we generate from being in the homeowners business. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please. Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, thank you. So looking at the growth rates of Allstate brand and Esurance, obviously Esurance is a much smaller base but there's a lot of natural growth in direct. I would have thought you'd be adding policies in direct at this point in time, right now, given that I assume the pricing metrics you have around both distribution channels are similar. Why is the Allstate brand channel growth here than direct? Is there a theory behind that or is it just times change and different products sell better at different times? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: First, I don't think there are \u2013 you're appealing to different customers, different geography bases and therefore different competitive environment. We feel good about the Allstate brand business and that's really been coming. As Glenn said, we expanded distribution all through last year. You didn't see it in any of last year's numbers but you see it this quarter and we would expect that growth to continue in terms of the distribution and hopefully that will turn into growth in items in force. So Esurance, slightly different position. Its growth is really driven by expansion and homeowners, but we think there's plenty of opportunity to grow Esurance. Well, you just didn't see it this quarter. So I think both businesses, we would expect to grow items in forces as we go forward from here. Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Sometimes I tell people it's hard to tell why stocks are going to go up in the future as what's explained what they did in the past and I think you've talked around this but I hope you can answer the question better than me. We have enough time, half the 2015 frequency spike and now we are in a frequency, I don't even know what you're going to call it right now \u2013 levels (47:59) are lower than they were before the spike back then. I think you touched upon it but I'm hoping that maybe you have a little better color. Is there a grand theory about why frequency went up three years ago and maybe another grand theory about why it seems to be coming down right now? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: As a grand theory, it makes it sound like there's like one reason, so no. I would say \u2013 so, look, frequency came down for a long, long period of time because we had third tail light, anti-drunk driving laws, three cars per household versus two drivers, anti-lock brakes, there's a whole variety of things that happened and then it kind of leveled out for a period of time \u2013 maybe five or six years. And then in 2015 and 2016, it spiked up. Some of that was obviously related to economic activity \u2013 more people back at work, because about a third \u2013 if you look at where people drive their cars, a third is to work, a third is on errands, a third is for leisure, so they were driving more to work and if you have more money, you do more leisure. And so miles driven went up so people got more accidents. Some people would say it was somewhat related to distracted driving. I think that's impossible to predict because you're talking about knowing whether somebody was looking at their phone or just put their phone down right before they got in an accident. That information just is not available so people are looking at results and trying to come up with conclusions as to why it might be that way. What we do know is that it went up and we had react. It went up for two years in a row. We increased our prices to account for it. It came down last year and I think the clarity on that is as far as the increase, which is we just know it went down and that puts us in a better profit position in getting to see opportunity to grow. It's down this quarter, but I don't think you should take that to a trend. I think frequency bounces around a lot and when we give our underlying combined ratio guidance, it's because it does bounce around a lot. It had nothing to do with our view on the economics of the business. We earn really high economic rents from our customers because we do a really good job for them and we do that when our competitors don't, so it's not like we're taking advantage of anybody. We're just good at what we do and we think that auto business is a good profit generator and a growth vehicle as it will be in the future, irrespective of what happens to frequency. Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Well, good luck and let frequency be low for everyone, drivers and companies. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Yes, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, everybody. Just a couple of quick ones, I think. So looking at the 17% year-over-year growth in new issued applications in Allstate brand auto, did you see momentum accelerate there over the quarter? Did it decelerate? Was it roughly constant? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: The 17% year-over-year growth in new business, Glenn, the question was... Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: Yeah. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: ...did it accelerate? You're getting into monthly numbers, which we don't disclose. Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: Well, so thanks, Yaron. First of all, the growth came in pretty balanced way. We got growth across a lot of different states. We got growth in areas that we targeted that we wanted growth. We invested in local marketing. What I would say is that it's been pretty balanced and pretty healthy in that the whole system is responding right now. As Tom mentioned, we've talked about for a few quarters, the fact that we're trying to grow our distribution system, but also make it more effective. So, I'd say one, it's growing. I mentioned that before \u2013 1,200 more points of sale out there and less turnover. Two, the system is more efficient. We've got quotes per agent up, new business per agent across the country up. We're serving our customers' needs more broadly because we're selling across the system more so even \u2013 I know you're talking about the 17% in auto, but we're up 15% new business in home, too. So we're selling across the system more effectively. And then, and I think maybe most importantly, the system is investing in itself right now. Agents feel good. Everywhere I go across the country, agents are positive. They're feeling good about their opportunity, their economic opportunity in the system. They're marketing in their local environments. They're hiring staff and leaning in, so all of those elements are really driving pretty broad growth. Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thank you. And then my second question is around prior-year development. So, the adjustment for the company's bodily injury claims handling has clearly been a positive for favorable prior-year development. How much longer do you think this favorable tailwind continues? And then are there other initiatives in place or on the way that could lead to lower losses or more efficient reserving? Mario Rizzo - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah, hi this is Mario. So I'd say, look, we are continually looking at our reserve balances across all coverages and we feel really good about where our reserve position is. Because of some of the things we've done on the claim side to manage, particularly the injury coverages we've seen, some favorable development over the last several quarters, I would tell you it's \u2013 I'm not going to sit here and predict whether that will continue or not. I will tell you we'll continue to look at reserves. And claims, I think is a process that's a moving target. You always want to get better in your claim handling. And when we talk about continuous improvement, that's really an area where continually reinventing ourselves in how we handle claims is really a critical part of our business model. And we've been pretty successful at that historically. And I think that's what's generated some of the equity you've seen in our reserve position, but we feel good about reserves. We'll keep looking at them. And it's hard to predict whether they'll continue to favorably develop at the same pace. Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. My first question is just on the capital side of things. You guys issued debt in some preferreds in the quarter. Can you just update us is this part of just normal adding to your leverage? Do you see yourselves as you using this for your buyback or is there maybe a component of having some capital flexibility for future acquisitions built in there? And then, if there is a component of flexibility for acquisitions, if you could just update us on some things that you might be thinking about in terms of that could be additive to the Allstate profile? Mario Rizzo - The Allstate Corp.: Thanks, Elyse. This is Mario. So I guess where I'd start is we feel really good about our capital position. We got a really strong capital position overall. And having said that, we're always looking for ways to optimize our capital structure, and what you really saw in the first quarter was an opportunity to issue securities at attractive levels, both from a senior debt perspective as well as perpetual preferred stock, which we view as really a permanent part of our capital structure. So we did the issuances. We're going to use the proceeds to pay down some debt that's maturing in May and also call some junior subordinated debt that had lost equity credit that, on a floating rate basis, had a relatively higher coupon. So we're going to do that. So we're going to swap out some debt or some of the debt that we just issued at more attractive rates. And then we have the opportunity \u2013 and we haven't decided on this yet, we have the opportunity to call some of our preferred stock later in the year and we took the opportunity to issue again what we view as permanent capital at really attractive levels. And we'll make that decision in terms of what to do with the proceeds going forward, but we feel really good about where we're at from a capital perspective and we really like the flexibility that gives us, both to invest in growth in the business and look for other opportunities that might come along. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: And with our capital position earnings power, we don't need to prefund anything to do an acquisition. We don't need to go out and raise money in advance to try and do something. If we wanted to do something, we would just fund it at that point in time. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Is there something, Tom, on your radar screen or it's just dependent upon maybe some things that become available in the market? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: If you look at our track record, we're not averse to buying things but we're kind of picky. And it's got be related to our strategy and it has to be a good company. So, SquareTrade, which we bought a little over a year ago, was related to our strategy to insure more things for people, particularly the electronic items that they have. And Don might want to just comment on how we've done relative to that. But we said we're thoughtful about it. Other places we might look would be to the extent we could expand other lines of business that could be sold by our Allstate agencies, would be interesting to us. And then as there is always new stuff in the market, so we're not averse to it, but I don't have like a list of here's five companies we have to buy so that we can be strategically sound. We're in a really good position. Don, maybe you just want to mention about SquareTrade? Don Civgin - The Allstate Corp.: Yes. Look, the first full-year is behind us now. As I'm sure you were all thinking about a year ago, a lot can go wrong when you do an acquisition. We laid out three objectives for the acquisition. I'm happy to say we're hitting all of them. The first was growth and you can see again this quarter continued growth, both in policies and in premiums. Second was to be able to improve the returns in the business. And as Mario mentioned, we've taken more of the underwriting in-house, but on top of that the loss ratios are running well and the company is just performing well from the profitability point of view. The third was to improve their growth opportunities outside U.S. retail which is where the main business is and they've done a really nice job in that. The European business, albeit a little under 10% of their total book has nearly doubled in the last quarter. So, the three objectives we've set, I feel like we're hitting all of them. If you remember when we did the acquisition, we said we chose SquareTrade because they were service-obsessed and that fit well with the way we want to treat our customers. Having met with a number of their existing and prospective customers, I can tell you they are really good at onboarding and serving their end-customers and creating value for the retailer. So I feel like we made the right choice. I'm glad we did it and if we had that choice again, I'd do it in a heartbeat. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Let me just add one other piece here. So when we talk retailers, that's both electronic and big-box. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then just really quickly on SquareTrade, there was a $30 million boost to the topline from the accounting change in the quarter. Was there any impact from that accounting change on the bottom line earnings in the quarter? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: No. It was net neutral to income. It was just the revenue impact from the accounting change. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. John Griek - The Allstate Corp.: Jonathan, we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly, our final question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Your question, please. Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thanks for fitting me in. I guess, very quickly, just going back to the questions on the unexpected decline in frequency, should investors brace for a time when we would have an unexpected reversal in frequency too? Is that sort of the takeaway in constantly reminding us that this frequency is an outlier? How should we think about that? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Amit, I think you brace for things when something bad is going to happen to you. What I would say is our auto business is very profitable. It would be very profitable and we should be growing it even if we were at a combined ratio that was 86% to 88%, which is our annual outlook. And so what I think investors should be excited about is the fact that we have a business that is very profitable; that business is starting to grow and that should add, increase shareholder value when it was getting smaller over the last couple of years as we improved this profitability. So we no longer need to do that, so we're on the offensive now beginning to grow that business and I think that's what investors should be focused on versus \u2013 this is not just a profit machine, it's a shareholder value machine. We have auto insurance, we have home insurance, we've got our performance-based stuff, we've got Life business and Benefits, we've got SquareTrade and all of those things create incremental value for our shareholders and are consistent with our strategy. So I think to get too focused on one specific measure is just the wrong way to think about investing in our company. That's not the way we run the company. We run the company for long-term shareholder value and so I wouldn't brace for anything. I'd be looking forward and being optimistic about the amount of money we're making in this business and how we can grow it. Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got it. But the only other quick question I have is on the pricing discussion. And we didn't spend time on discussing the rate trends which you've shown on page 18 of the supplement. How should we think about, I guess, the trajectory of the rate filings from here? And thanks for fitting me in. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Well, we've talked about this before. Given the kind of combined ratios we have, you shouldn't expect to see big increases in the topline on an average premium standpoint but we'll make up for that, in part, by growing the business. So I would just say, don't get too focused on the one measure of performance on one line for the entire company. This is a large corporation. We got lots of ways in which we make money and add value to our customers. All of those did really well in the first quarter or better than we expected. And even if they had been at the level we expected it, it still would have been a great quarter. So, I feel like there's \u2013 don't get too focused on one item really; think about the whole value creation and we've got lots of value to create by growing the business at really attractive returns. So, thank you all. We're off to a good start. We look forward to talking to you in second quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a Q&A session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. John Griek - The Allstate Corp.: Well, thank you, Daniel. And good morning, and welcome everyone to Allstate's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Here today are Tom Wilson, CEO, Steve Shebik, Vice Chair; Mario Rizzo, CFO; Glenn Shapiro, President of Allstate Personal Lines; Don Civgin, President of Service Businesses; John Dugenske, Chief Investment and Corporate Strategy Officer; Mary Jane Fortin, President of our Life, Retirement, and Benefit businesses; and Eric Ferren, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we filed the 10-Q for the second quarter and posted the press release, investor supplement, and today's presentation on our website at allstateinvestors.com. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2017 and other public documents for information on potential risks. This discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement. Now I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Well, good morning. Thank you for investing your time to keep up on our progress at Allstate. Allstate continued to deliver excellent operating results, and we're on pace to achieve our 2018 operating priorities. The strategy to deliver differentiated products to consumers is laid out on slide 2 and is working. So starting with our Property-Liability businesses on the left, we have four market-facing businesses each with a different customer value proposition and go-to-market business model. The Allstate Brand in the lower left competes in the local advise and branded segment and growth accelerated in the second quarter. Esurance in the lower right focuses on self-serve customers who preferred branded product and its premium increased 12.5% over the prior year. We leverage our pricing, analytical, and operating expertise across these businesses, which comprise 86% of revenues and 91% of adjusted net income, and create substantial value for our shareholders. Our focus on value creation also includes the four areas in the right panel. We're enhancing customer value propositions through increased connectivity. A good example of this is the use of telematics in the Allstate agency and Esurance businesses. We use connectivity to give customers a price for auto insurance that reflects individual driving behavior and give them the opportunity to buy it by the mile. So for those of you who are in New Jersey, you've likely seen our wraps on the ferries and in the advertising in the subway. We're also working to improve our customers' driving experience by maintaining this connection beyond what's needed to create an Insurance Risk Score. QuickFoto Claim enables us to pay auto insurance claims in hours versus days. And we believe we lead the industry in implementing this technology, which is highlighted in our advertising. We also create value through growth in a number of large, significant businesses like Allstate Benefits, Allstate Life, and SquareTrade. The value of these businesses is substantial but can be overshadowed by the sheer size and scale of the Property-Liability business. As Mario will discuss, we also proactively manage capital to create shareholder value. Turning to slide 3, Allstate's growth increased and returns were excellent in the quarter. Revenues exceeded $10 billion with increases in average premiums and policies in force. As you can see from the green box on the far right of the table, Allstate protection policies in force grew 0.9% in the second quarter of 2018, which is due to growth in the Allstate and Esurance brands. Service Businesses grew policies in force nearly 36% due to SquareTrade. If you move back to the left, you'll see that net income was $637 million or $1.80 per share in the second quarter 2018, with adjusted net income of $675 million or $1.90 a share. In the middle at the bottom, net income return on equity was 17% and was 15.8% on adjusted net income. The Property-Liability underlying combined ratio for the first half of 2018 was better than our annual outlook of 86 to 88, primarily driven by lower auto accident frequency. So given this positive result, the underlying combined ratio outlook improved to 85 to 87 for the full-year 2018. If you turn to slide 4, we also made good progress on our five 2018 operating priorities. Those first three priorities, better serve customers, achieve target economic returns on capital and grow the customer base, are intertwined to ensure profitable long-term growth. We've made progress on better serving customers as the Net Promoter Score improved across most of our businesses. Customer retention improved for both Allstate and the Esurance Property-Liability businesses, which is a key driver of growth. Returns were good in total as we just discussed. The Property-Liability recorded combined ratio of 94.9, generated $416 million in underwriting income for the quarter. Allstate Life and Allstate Benefits also generated attractive returns. Growth increased. Allstate and Esurance brands grew policies in force from higher and increased new business. Allstate continued its long track record of growth with policies in force growing 5.4% over the prior-year quarter. SquareTrade added 13.2 million policies over the last 12 months. The fourth priority, to proactivity manage investments, is imperative in a low interest rate but accelerating growth environment. The $83 billion investment portfolio generated $824 million in net investment income in the second quarter. Total return was 0.5%, as the contribution from investment income was partially offset by lower fixed income valuation. We're also committed to building new long-term growth platforms. SquareTrade and Arity are two good examples of progress on this priority. John will now go through our Property-Liability results in more detail. John Griek - The Allstate Corp.: Thanks, Tom. Slide 5 shows an overview of our Property-Liability results. Net written premium growth of 6.4% in the second quarter was driven by accelerated growth in the Allstate and Esurance brands. The recorded combined ratio of 94.9 was 1.7 points better than the second quarter of 2017, due to increased premiums earned, lower catastrophe losses, higher favorable non-catastrophe prior-year reserve re-estimates and lower auto insurance accident frequency. This was partially offset by an increase in the expense ratio due to higher agent and employee-related compensation and technology costs. The underlying combined ratio which excludes catastrophes and prior-year reserve re-estimates was 85.5 for second quarter of 2018 and 84.8 for the first six months of the year. As Tom mentioned, we are improving the guidance range by 1 point to 85 to 87 for the full-year 2018. This revised range takes into account more moderate frequency assumptions than originally planned, the seasonal nature of loss performance in the second half of the year, investments in growth initiatives, and the deployment of tax savings. Now let's spend a few minutes discussing each brand in some detail. Slide 6 covers operating results for Allstate Brand auto insurance. Starting with the bottom left chart, policies in force grew by 262,000 or 1.3% in the second quarter of 2018. The Renewal ratio of 88.5 was an improvement of 1.1 points from the prior-year quarter, benefiting from our focus on the customer experience and a stable rate environment. New issued applications grew year-over-year for the sixth consecutive quarter, increasing 18% compared to the second quarter of 2017. On the right hand box, the recorded combined ratio for the second quarter was 93.0, 2.6 points better than the prior-year quarter and generated $358 million in underwriting income. The primary drivers of profitability improvement were increased average earned premium, higher favorable prior-year reserve re-estimates, lower catastrophe losses, and a broad-based decline in accident frequency. The underlying combined ratio of 92.8 in the second quarter of 2018 included an underlying loss ratio of 66.8, an improvement of 0.7 points compared to the prior-year quarter. This was more than offset by a higher expense ratio, driven by higher agent and employee-related compensation costs. Let's go to slide 7 to cover Allstate Brand homeowners insurance results. Starting at the bottom left, policies in force grew 0.8% compared to the prior year, as both the renewal ratio and new issued applications increased. The bottom right chart provides detail on profitability. Homeowners insurance recorded combined ratio was 98.3 in the second quarter. Performance for this line is better evaluated over a 12-month period given weather seasonality and variability. Allstate Brand homeowners insurance generated $932 million of underwriting income with a recorded combined ratio of 86.5 over the last 12 months. Slide 8 provides financial highlights for Esurance and Encompass. Esurance had strong growth and improved underlying profitability in the quarter. Esurance net written premium grew 12.5% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting increased average premium in auto and homeowners insurance, and a 4.1% increase in total policies in force. This quarter's policy growth benefited from a 3.2% increase in auto insurance policies in force and the expansion into homeowners insurance. The recorded combined ratio of 101.9 in the second quarter was 4.2 points below the prior-year quarter, as shown on the upper right, due to the improvement in both the loss and expense ratios. The underlying combined ratio of 95.9 was 4.6 points better than the prior-year quarter, as both auto and homeowners insurance results improved. Encompass continues to execute its profit improvement plan and generated underwriting income in the quarter. There was a 6.6% decline in net written premium over the last 12 months and policies in force were 11.1% lower in 2018. Encompass's recorded combined ratio of 98.4 in the second quarter of 2018 was 6 points lower than the prior-year quarter, as the improvement in the underlying loss ratio more than offset expense ratio. The underlying combined ratio of 5.5 for the second quarter was 2.1 points better than the prior-year period due to increased average premium and auto insurance frequency. And now I'll turn it over to Mario. Mario Rizzo - The Allstate Corp.: Thanks, John. Let's go to slide 9, which provides detail on our Service Businesses. In the second quarter, revenue grew to $320 million, and policies in force reached 49.1 million. Adjusted net income was $1 million in the quarter, a $9 million improvement over the prior-year quarter, due to improved loss experience at SquareTrade and Allstate Dealer Services. SquareTrade revenues of $122 million were $52 million above the prior year with half the increase driven by organic revenue growth and the remainder due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. SquareTrade made progress on the three objectives supporting its acquisition as domestic policies in force increased, loss experience improved, and the international business expanded. Turning to slide 10, let's review our Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuities results. Allstate Life generated attractive returns on capital, with adjusted net income of $78 million in the second quarter shown in the bottom left chart. This was due to a lower effective tax rate, higher premium and increased net investment income. Allstate Benefits adjusted net income shown in the top middle chart on the page was $34 million in the second quarter. The $9 million increase from the prior-year quarter was primarily driven by increased premiums, improved benefit ratio on selected products, and a lower effective tax rate. Allstate Annuities on the far right had adjusted net income of $44 million in the quarter, which was $21 million lower than the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower performance-based investment results, compared to a very strong prior-year quarter, which remained low due to the relatively high regulatory capital rates. Slide 11 highlights our investment results. We proactively manage our investment portfolio based on our long-term strategic risk profile, relevant market conditions, and corporate risk appetite. Net investment income was $824 million, 8.1% lower than the prior-year quarter, due to exceptional performance-based results in 2017. The chart at the bottom left of the slide shows net investment income split between the market and performance-based portfolios. Market-based investment income shown in blue increased and reflects higher portfolio yields. Performance-based investment income shown in gray was the primary driver of the decrease over 2017. While performance-based income in the quarter was lower than the last four quarters, this reflected very strong returns last year, due to favorable equity markets. The annualized yield on the performance-based portfolio was 9% this quarter, in comparison to 16.8% last year. Total return in the quarter is shown on the lower right. The positive return in the quarter was supported by a stable contribution from income, shown in blue, but was dampened by lower fixed income valuations due to increased market yields which is shown in gray. Total return was break-even for the first six months of 2018 as $1.6 billion of investment income was offset by a decline in the value of the portfolio, reflecting higher interest rates and wider credit spreads. Slide 12 provides an overview of our capital strength. Adjusted net income return on equity, shown in the bottom left chart, was 15.8% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2018, an increase of 2.3 points compared to the prior-year period. Book value per share increased to $59.16 or 9.9% since the second quarter of 2017 as higher earnings and a 4.1% reduction in shares outstanding offset the impact of dividends, share repurchases, and a decline in fixed income unrealized gains and losses. Our capital position is excellent. And we returned $722 million to common shareholders in the second quarter. Since the end of 2012, we have reduced the number of shares outstanding by 132 million, or 28%, as shown in the bottom right chart. Now we'll open up the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning and congrats on a good quarter. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the competitive environment. We're hearing that some competitors are starting to cut price. And so I just wanted to get your thoughts. Do you still think you can accelerate growth and maintain underlying margins in that environment over the next few years? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Morning, Sarah. This is Tom. I'll make a comment, and then Glenn may want to jump in here as well. First, I assume you're talking about just auto insurance as opposed to home insurance or any of the other things we do? Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, yes. Sorry about that. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Okay, no. So in the auto insurance business that you've seen over the \u2013 so if you go back to 2015, 2016 \u2013 we were early on increasing prices. Other people \u2013 we saw that coming perhaps slightly earlier than some people. Then you saw a number of companies start to increase prices after that period of time. You see that moderating with many competitors now. But there are some, particularly one direct company, who's still taking some pretty big price increases, State Farm did recently reduce their price in a number of states. But I think you have to \u2013 rather than look at it on a percentage basis \u2013 think about what the absolute price is, because if you come down 2% or 3% but you're 10% higher than everyone else, it doesn't really matter that much. If you \u2013 it's all on what your absolute price is. And we feel very good with where our absolute price is today when we look at our close rates relative to number of quotes we get. So we feel good about where we're positioned in the industry and don't think there's any, like, big price war coming if that's what's in your mind. Glenn, maybe you want to add something to that? Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: Yeah, thanks, Tom. Just adding on, we do \u2013 we feel good about where we are competitively. We look at these rates on a state-by-state basis and we monitor the filings of all of our competitors. What we see is \u2013 yes, there's some slowdown, and Tom talked about one carrier that took some reductions as part of a change in their pricing, but we still see rate coming through the system. And if you look at the CPI, the first quarter was really high. On a year-over-year basis, it was, like, 9% in auto insurance. Year-to-date, we look at the most recent, it's still around 8%. A lot of that are the rates burning in that were taken in the last year. And we don't see as much filing activity right now. But there's still some. So it's still, I would call, a positive rate environment and we're well in the fact that we've taken those rates, good pricing position, to be stable for our customers. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. And then secondly, you talked a lot about frequency declining. To what extent do you think that persists? And is that factored in in your prices? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Glenn will talk about what we see to-date that's been realized. And then we'll come back to forecasting. Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: Yeah. So frequency, as Tom always says, there's a level of unpredictability to it. But there are components that we can have, both some facts on and some opinions on. So I'll talk internal and external. Internally, we like the quality of our book. If you look back over the past couple of years and we took some rates, those rates tended to shift the quality of our book because some of the less tenured business walked away from us as oppose to the more tenured business and higher risk business walked away more quickly than lower risk business, or quality improved. Then you look at the business we're bringing on and we like the growth that we're getting because about 70% of our growth is actually coming from improved retention, which is a nice way, nice balanced way to grow. And the other 30% that's coming from new business, we monitor the quality of that business and we feel good about the quality coming in as we look at the risk profile, the percentage of full coverage, the percentage bundled. All of that gives us confidence that we have a good quality coming into the book that's favorably impacted frequency. From an external standpoint, there's more of a mix of backed-in hypothesis. You've got the miles driven trends we look at and a number of other external trends. I would say automobile improvements that are driving less frequency are starting to burn into the overall car park \u2013 the car community that there's more lane departure warning and blind spot warning. And some of those things have a favorable impact. But all that said, there is a level of unpredictability as we've seen over the last few years that things can change in sort of the macroeconomic environment that moves frequency. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Gary Ransom with Dowling & Partners. Your line is now open. Gary Kent Ransom - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC : Yes, good morning. I was wondering if you could compare and contrast the Milewise versus Drivewise. And some things are obvious. The pricing is different. But the level of connectivity and the level of customer interaction, I wonder if there's any differences there. And I'm also interested in your opinion of whether pay-by-the-mile insurance is likely to attract a large share of the auto insurance market over time. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Both important questions, Gary. I'll start and Glenn can jump in. So first, we're using increased connectivity for two purposes with our customers. One is to give them a more specific price relative to their individual driving behavior. And, two, to improve their driving experience. So the first piece is what many people in telematics are doing which is, you can look at not just where somebody garages their car or how they used to drive based on their motor vehicle records and claim behavior. But you can look at actually, where, when, and how they drive specifically that day. So that gives you a lot of options including Milewise. And Glenn can talk about Milewise. What we're in three states now. And particularly why we went to New Jersey. That'll give you some sense for how ubiquitous Milewise might end up being as a payment in pricing setup. The second thing we're doing is working hard on using that connection to improve the driving experience, to improve customer loyalty and drive retention. So not everybody has taken this approach, but we maintain the connection, whether it's through your phone or your phone connected to an OBD port device to give you information about what the warning light is on your car. John a couple months ago, came in, had a warning light on his car. By the time he got to his desk, it said here's what's wrong with it, here's how serious it is, here's about what it'll cost, and here's three people you can connect to, to help you fix your car. You can also do things like finally resolve which of you or your significant others are really the better driver. So there's a lot of things we're trying to do to increase and take what is, oftentimes, a low engagement product into a high engagement product. Glenn, do you want to talk about Milewise and what you see there? Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: Yeah. So, Milewise, the early read I would say, very positive. I think there's a lot still to be determined. It's a good question about what percentage of the market it'll take. I can tell you the experience in expanding into New Jersey a few months ago, has been very favorably received. And I'll share an anecdote or two that will tell you how it works for folks. People intuitively, don't feel good about paying full freight if their car sits parked most of the time, because they use public transportation, they're in a metropolitan area. It doesn't make sense to them to pay those type of prices for full auto insurance when they don't use the car very much. So we've had specific situations and really even in the first week after we launched I got some notes from agents that said I had a customer that's about to walk out the door with their business because they just felt like the rate was too much for the amount they used their car, and they wanted to get less coverage somewhere else. And I was able to save the business by saying, hey, this might make sense for you. So we're seeing really nice uptake. The early signs are very positive. It's still \u2013 it is a niche within our market \u2013 so the percentage remains to be seen. But I think it's an important niche, and potentially a growing niche, over time, with people that don't use their car primarily and use other sources. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Marcos Holanda - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. This is Marcos calling in for Greg. My first question has to do with processes to control costs in the context of InsurTech. It seems like the next wave of operational efficiency for carriers following online quoting will be on the claim side. Do you guys agree with that? And can you perhaps talk about how the adoption of QuickFoto Claim is developing and what are some of the challenges there? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Marcos, I'll give you a perspective on what we would call integrated digital enterprise which we've been at for a number of years now. And then Glenn can give you an update on QuickFoto Claim without getting into any specific numbers because it's competitive, the information on what we're doing. But the combination of digital recognition technology, that's the ability of a computer to look at a picture and tell something from it is developing quite rapidly. And when you combine that with the ubiquitous amount of cameras out there, communication costs, and the ability to build new and more sophisticated algorithms which take that digital information and turn it in and use it for decision-making, it's going to dramatically change the business. Claims is clearly one of those places where it can change the business. And so we've put that \u2013 we're using that in QuickFoto Claim. It can be used in many other parts of the business. So InsurTech goes well beyond just those experiences. So for example, we're just launching the ability to sell a homeowners policy by verifying three pieces of information rather than have our agency owners and licensed sales professionals be in the data collection business and answer \u2013 ask you a whole bunch of questions of which maybe you know, maybe you don't know, but we certainly can buy the information on digitally. So you're correct in saying that \u2013 and we have it separate, it's called integrated digital enterprise \u2013 which is to do that throughout our entire company. Glenn, do you want to give an update on QuickFoto Claim? Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: Yeah, so very happy with what's going on in the adoption of QuickFoto Claim. And it's one of those change management exercises that at first it feels very big. It's a big shift for people. But a year and a half or so into a bigger launch of it, it's just the way we do business right now. And customers really like it. Our agents like it. The employees like working through it. And I'll break down the parts of work, if you just think about segments of work. Historically, about half of the units of work were getting the human to the car or the car to the human. And that was a customer effort. That was our effort for employees. In some way, we had to get the person that's going to write an estimate in front of that vehicle physically. The other half of the work was actually writing the estimate. So what Tom talked about is right on with photographs potentially doing that work through artificial intelligence on that piece. The QuickFoto was essentially eliminating that first half of the work. We didn't have to get the car to the human or the human to the car. The photos flowed through and we're able to, as Tom said in the opening, in hours settle claims that would take days previously. So very positive adoption. Very positive customer experience. Marcos Holanda - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that color. My follow-up would be on SquareTrade. There was a nice uptick in PIF in the quarter but revenues came flat versus Q1 following several sequential quarters of improvement. So I guess just some color there? Don Civgin - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah. Marcos, it's Don. First, SquareTrade is off to a really great start with Allstate. When we did the acquisition, we set three goals. The first was to increase our business with domestic retailers, both with additional retailers as well as the business we do with the existing ones. Second was to improve the profitability, and you can see the improvement this quarter, partially as a result of us taking the underwriting risk but also the loss and the expenses have been trending very nicely as well. And then the third was to build an additional platform for them for future growth. Europe has done quite well for them, and this quarter, we're seeing roughly double the volume. It's still fairly small, but double the volume we had last year. So specifically to your question, it's \u2013 you have to look a little bit beyond quarter-to-quarter, because it can be a little bit lumpy. You've got some seasonality in there. It depends on when you pick up additional retailers and when they begin to ramp up their program. So I think the better trend to look at is year-over-year. Now the numbers look a little exaggerated because of revenue recognition, but roughly half of the increase is organic. Part of that is picking up additional retailers, but part of it is just doing a better job with retailers we have and their customers. So, very happy with their progress thus far. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Your line is now open. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. My first question is on the strong growth in Allstate Brand. That continues to accelerate each quarter. Just trying to get a perspective on if you would expect that trend to continue in the back half? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Jay, this is Tom. As you know we don't give guidance on either the top or the bottom line. When you look at the growth that you've \u2013 the first time we're \u2013 it's been year-over-year up, but if you look over the last three quarters, it's been headed in that direction. We were expecting it to continue to head in that direction. A key point I would note is that a significant portion of that growth is driven by retention. And that's a gift that keeps on giving. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. Okay. Can you also discuss the strong growth in new applications in the Allstate Brand? What you view as the drivers there? Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: Yeah, this is Glenn. I'll take that, Jay. I'd really look across the whole system and what's gone on to drive the growth. So we've talked about going back over the past few years. There's been a plan that Matt had talked about the plans of how we're going to grow the distribution system and make it more effective. So we've increased our footprint. We're up, if you look year-over-year, about 1,600 points of presence between agencies and licensed sales professionals. We have them more engaged because they're winning in the market right now, so they're marketing locally and they're drawing those quotes in. They're hiring more staff. We've improved in meeting our customer needs because we have a higher percentage of full coverage and a higher percentage of bundling going into. And as Tom said, retention is up, driving a lot of the growth. And the more quoting activity is really those agents hunting within their markets and being effective marketing in those communities. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse : Hey, thanks. I had a follow-up on auto frequencies. And I appreciate \u2013 I know you guys used the terms, there's a level of unpredictability and there's hypothesis surrounding what drives them. But I was curious if Allstate has a view on whether the level of unpredictability or the volatility of frequency has changed on a go forward basis versus what it's been historically. Basically do you think there's consumer factors out there that should cause us to think it might be more or less volatile over time? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Mike, this is Tom. Maybe I'll take it and, Glenn, if you want to add at the end, jump in. So first, I understand the benefit of being able to determine what the trend is on frequency. And I know you \u2013 people have poked around at this with their competitors as well. You can actually make a sector prediction or you can access the individual company performance. That said, frequency falls into the known, unknown category as it relates to the future whether that it's absolute level or the volatility in it. And so we think the decision on frequency really ought to be based on the business model that is how good are the processes and people? So \u2013 well, what, of course, we do know is there's been a long-term decline for a lot of good reasons, whether that's drunk driving laws and cultural unacceptability of drunk driving, antilock brakes, more cars per household. There's a variety of things. Which \u2013 now on the short term, of course there's a number of drivers which make it more unknown there. So it's a number of miles driven, which of course impacted by economic activity, gas prices, weather at the particular time of day. So if you have ice at 4 p.m., it's different than if you have ice at 2 a.m. We do know from our Drivewise customers that the number of miles has declined, number of miles driven over the last couple of years, really starting in the fourth quarter 2016. But how that will be in the future, it's hard to tell. So \u2013 and then you have seasonality of course. So seasonality, the frequency's typically higher, a lot higher in second half of the year than the first half, which if people want to talk about our guidance, we factor that in that we do think frequency is typically up first \u2013 the second half versus the first half of a given year. So it's \u2013 but one point I tend to think about, it's almost like if I use it \u2013 it's baseball season so I use a baseball analogy. You have a pitcher, and you have a hitter. As a coach, you kind of know in general what the pitcher's good at, whether they get a fastball or curveball or something like that. But you don't know how good they're going be that day, nor do you know what every individual pitch is going to be. So to win, you just need the best hitter, someone who can pick up the pitch early, as soon as it releases from the person's hand, and react before it hits the plate. In auto insurance, Allstate's a good hitter, right? In 2015, the frequency went up. We picked it up early. We made choice. We saw the same pitch in 2016 and we continued to see it. Others didn't see it. They then caught up. Frequency is down in 2017 and 2018, so as a hitter, our reaction is not to slack up and lower our prices. It's to just get a bit more margin. So what we do is we have a system that picks it up by state, by risk class, and that's really, I think, the best way to try to get a sense for how do you invest based on frequency, is think about the process, the people, the technology and can they hit. Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Tom. I'm going to switch gears quickly to homeowners. And I'm probably splitting hairs here, but if I look at the trailing 12 month underlying loss ratio in auto \u2013 sorry, in Allstate Brand home, it's up a couple points over the last couple of years. Just curious, if that's \u2013 at the current levels of profitability, are you happy with those levels or is there something that you're monitoring and might take more action to improve the underlying? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Well, you're living our life, which is we live our life splitting hairs. So I'll let Glenn take that one. Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: Right. I would like to start with sort of a longer term view. Because the second quarter marks the 24th consecutive quarter under 100 combined ratio in home. And in a volatile line of business, like homeowners, to have six years running of quarterly profit is remarkable. So we do take a long view on it. Just like in auto, we're looking state-by-state at our rates. We look at loss results. But if you look over the last five years, even at the underlying, we always say we want to be in the low-60s. And we were at the upper end the last couple of quarters of low-60s, at 63 and change. But if you look at two, three, four years ago, we're similar to those timeframes. And a lot of that is driven by weather. So we talk a lot about catastrophes but the non-cat weather, it drives our peril mix, which drives severity. It's just so much more volatility in the homeowners line than you see in auto between the frequencies and severities driven by weather patterns. So the long-term view, we feel very good about. We're monitoring from a rate standpoint and I would not say there are alarm bells based on the hair splitting or anything you brought there. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: So why don't you talk a little bit about what you did see in peril mix and stuff in the second quarter? Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: Yeah, so definitely \u2013 whereas in the first quarter, we talked a lot about water and fire; continued with the water, definitely wind driving some of the peril mix moving with even intra-quarter decline on the fire \u2013 some fire in the quarter, but moving throughout the quarter downward. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: So fire, fire loss is a lot higher. Like when fire gets in, your severity is a lot more higher than if somebody runs in your garage door. And so we had elevated fire losses in the second quarter and the same as wind and hail. So that bumped it up. That said, we watch it, right? And we have processes built in by a state to make sure we think we need to increase price because either frequency or severity, we do that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Christopher Campbell with KBW. Your line is now open. Christopher Campbell - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Yes, hi, good morning. . Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Good morning, Christopher. We can't hear the question. Maybe you can repeat it. Christopher Campbell - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Yes. Can you hear me now? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Yes. Christopher Campbell - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great. I guess the first question is just on capital management. So Allstate's been a strong repurchaser of shares and bought a bunch back this quarter. Now is there a certain hurdle above which that you're thinking of where repurchases wouldn't be economical? And then how was your capital deployment strategy change if the shares got too expensive? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: I'll let Mario talk about the overall capital plan, but I would say that a business that's growing with a 17% ROE with its current multiples, we think it's cheap. Mario Rizzo - The Allstate Corp.: Yes, I would agree. Hi, Chris, this is Mario. So I guess where I'd start is when we look at our capital position, it continues to be excellent and we view it as a source of both strength and flexibility for us. And when I say that, I mean, the absolute level of capital we have, our capital structure and our capacity to source capital efficiently if we need to. When you look at those things combined with \u2013 to Tom's point, fact that the business is performing really well. We expect to continue to generate meaningful amounts of capital going forward. So we're long capital and we feel really good about our capital position. In terms of the buyback program, we still have $376 million left on the existing authorization and we'll continue to buy back stock. And when we run out, we'll follow the same process we always have. We'll talk to our board. We'll look at different alternatives and we'll make a call from that point. Christopher Campbell - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, that's very helpful. And then just kind of one other question on SquareTrade. What's driving the year-over-year loss ratio improvement? Don Civgin - The Allstate Corp.: It's actually a variety of things. I mean, first, as they build up their scale, they're getting more effective. And so a combination of things like their claims handling, their ability to reduce escalations and so forth are all leading to better experience for the customer and lower loss costs for them. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, I wanted to thank you hitters for taking my question. The homeowners growth and auto growth seems to be going in line with each other. I assume that that's mostly bundled sales. I'm interested in knowing how the homeowners only product is selling and what the marketplace looks like for growing in homeowners only. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Well, you're correct, Josh, in that you remember when auto was going down, the homeowners business got slightly smaller as well. But it lagged it, right? Because it's an annual policy, not everybody has it. So to the extent we were losing auto customers because we were raising prices, that impacted it and you see the other side of that. Glenn can talk about how we bundle, what we see in homeowners market. Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: Yeah, so we think it's great opportunity to bundle. And so we've aligned our incentives for agents around bundling. And we think it's the right thing for customers. What we're seeing in this cycle right now is that, as Tom said, it tends to lag the home \u2013 lags the auto in terms of whether it's going up or coming down. It seems to be pulling in a little more. And as you said, moving in tandem. So we're growing at pretty close to equivalent rates in real-time. So that is a result of more bundling of the product. We think we are very competitive in home right now. We have a lot of markets where we have a strong competitive position from a pricing standpoint. Our product is part of the reason for that. We have with house and home, a favorable product and our roof rating schedule allows us to do that. I think good catastrophe management and spread of risk over a long period of time has positioned us well for that. So we're in a really good spot to grow home. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And I realize that having a home product increases the persistency of selling in auto, too. But is a home-only product terribly less persistent than an auto-home bundle? And ultimately, is it a long-term value of a home-only customer high and worth pursuing? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Josh, let me take that. Before we do that, I'll let Steve talk about homeowners and Esurance. And then I'll come back to your question on the lifetime value of a customer, either by policy or in total. Steven E. Shebik - The Allstate Corp.: So yeah, as you know, in Esurance, we also have a homeowners product we rolled out over the last three or four years. We have it in 31 states I believe. And our PIF overall increasing Esurance is 4.1%, while it's 27% quarter-over-quarter from prior year in homeowners. So that's a really important sale for them because we spend money on marketing and advertising. And as we can get more premiums, so both auto and home, the cross-selling that we have \u2013 significantly makes the acquisition cost for us in terms of the customer acquisition. We're growing that for a handful of years now. We feel good with where we are. Obviously, you see we still have a really good geographic spread in the country. So we do have catastrophe quarters where we have some pretty good catastrophe. This is one of them. But we think we're doing well, growing well there. And it'll be a profitable addition to Esurance business. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: So \u2013 and on the \u2013 does it \u2013 what does it do for (46:37) couple of key themes there. We want to make sure we make money on every product we sell so we don't lose money on one product and make it on another. So we have standards around how we underwrite and price our products so we make money on every \u2013 in each product. That said, you do know that \u2013 we know actually and you're obviously aware of as well \u2013 that the more things people buy from you, the longer they stay as a group. Now some of that's just they buy more from you because they like you more. And they like you more so they stay more. So there's a little bit of you got to be careful onto what you read into it. That said, the more opportunities you have to build connections to customers where they have ongoing relationships with you, all things being equal, they should stay longer and it's good for you. You lower your acquisition cost per customer, you improve their customer value proposition. You don't have to shop around to a whole bunch of people, which is why particularly in the lower left, we have such a broad-based set of products and services. So whether that's auto insurance, home insurance, boat insurance, personal policies, life insurance, we sell them everything we can and we have metrics and measures around trying to do that, because we know it best meets their needs. And if we do that, they're more likely to stay. As Steve talked about, we're starting to expand that in the Esurance business as well, which particularly because of the high upfront acquisition costs, it helps you lower your acquisition costs dramatically and gives you a competitive advantage versus those people who only sell one thing. Sometimes they like \u2013 sometimes we end up only talking about auto insurance, and it's a big product for us. We need to compete aggressively in it, but we also want to win on a broad basis with our customers. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Michael W. Phillips - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Tom, let's just take a step back and I ask kind of I think it might be a bit of a goofy question, but I'm going to throw it out there, hear your thoughts. As you look at the agency playing field and the folks that run all your exclusive agencies, I guess how is the average age changed over time? Has it shifted any? And then, has it gotten any more difficult to find replacements or recruits to replace what may be an aging population out there over the past, say, three to five years? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Well, let me \u2013 I'll answer your question specifically. And then I think where you're headed a little bit, Mike, is what is the long-term view of the agency platform? And so, particularly you look at some of the independent agency industry metrics, it's, as you know, they're all getting older, they're staying in the business, but they may not be there forever and who's going to take them over, so will that go away? We don't have that problem in the Allstate agency channel. We're out recruiting people all the time, whether that be our agency owners or licensed sales professionals. And so, we don't have a, what I'll call a demographic barrier to our future growth, or even maintaining our current position. That said, I think the business is going to change dramatically and that technology is going to enable us to have those people in the field who know our customers do a much better effective job for them by doing less data collection. So if you go back to Glenn's view on integrated digital enterprise and the work effort that went into claims and how much was spent driving around, if you said instead of driving around you slipped in their data collection, then how much time is spent by agency systems in data collection. We're hard at work to trying to make that a much smaller piece of what they do. So maybe it's data verification and even then you don't have to do a tremendous amount of it. Change our products and processes and our technology to do that, used our technology to make the experience even better and then enhance by a person. So I do think there's going be a lot of change driven in that channel. And we're pushing hard on doing it. So we're not just sort of saying, \"Oh, jeez, can we still hire the same amount of people?\" Our challenge will be to transition that system effectively and efficiently on behalf of our customers. And we're hard at work at that. As we've talked about, Matt talked about, and Glenn's picked up the trusted advisor work. We have a whole another series of work related to technology and product that we've embarked on that we think will further accelerate that. Michael W. Phillips - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much for that detailed answer. Quick numbers question, if I could. The $135 million of development, I feel it's bodily injury liability and I'm assuming that's recent accident year 2017, maybe 2016. I guess if you could just confirm that. And then I noticed you took out the severity numbers of your press release unless I missed that (51:52)? Is that true for BI liability? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Right. There's two parts there. I'll let Mario handle the reserve changes, the net. He'll talk \u2013 and you're correct, it is bodily injury, but it wouldn't be the most recent years you're talking about. But, Mario can give you an update there. And then John can talk about what we've done on severity, because, as we talk about last time, we want to be fully transparent with everybody. But transparency also includes giving you information that means something. And so we changed the bodily severity stuff. So, Mario, do you want to start with reserves, and then John? Mario Rizzo - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah, sure. So, I guess the place I'd start on the \u2013 kind of from a broad perspective on reserves, as we've mentioned in the past, we have really solid processes in place to both established reserves and continually reassess the level of reserves that we have really across the entire business. And when we look at our roughly $26.6 billion gross reserve balance, we feel really good that it's set at the appropriate level. Having said that, as circumstances change, both in terms of our claim processes and the external environment, we look at that reserve balance every quarter and like we've done over the last number of quarters, to the extent there are releases, then we recognize those in the income statement. I think that's as much a function as our conservative approach to reserving as anything else. But I certainly wouldn't use that as a predictor of reserve releases going forward. It's just something we continue to look at and if reserves are redundant, we release them. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah, so when you look back at \u2013 it wouldn't have been the 2016 and 2017 report years on bodily injury, it was before that. So you would look back \u2013 if you were to adjust the calendar year, combined ratio numbers we gave you, which you'll be able to do when you get the information. You can see it was really prior years to them. John Griek - The Allstate Corp.: Hey, Mike, it's John. Just specific to your question on the BI severity disclosures. We're very transparent overall in our financial reporting. We're clearly trying to aim to provide you with the best metrics to evaluate the financial performance of our business. Last quarter, we did signal that we were going to be removing the BI paid severity statistic. Really on a long tail coverage like BI, using a calendar year paid severity measure, it's much more an operational statistic than something that gives you a clear line of sight to the P&L. We do factor in overall severity trends in our guidance each year. So it's included in our underlying combined ratio guidance. And this quarter, you can find some color in 10-Q in terms of what our overall severity trends look like. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney. Your line is now open. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Good morning. I'll give you a chance to throw cold water on my enthusiasm, Tom. Your service business broke into the black, I think, for the first quarter and your life earnings were up a decent bit sequentially and I think year-over-year excluding partnerships. Is it onward and upward for both units or were there some one-time items helping out? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Bob, as you know, first, cold water would be a bad idea, right? But guidance would be equally a bad idea when it comes down to individual components of the P&L. So I won't give you specifics. I would just say on both of them, we feel really good about our life insurance business. It's earning good returns. It's well run. We're bringing our costs down. We just launched a new term product which we think will really work well with our customer base. We tend to want something simpler, so this is a monthly term. It just pays you by the month what you want for your family for three years, five years as opposed to some big number which scares people, some of our customer base. And so we feel good about where that business is positioned both operationally and strategically. And we feel the same about the Service Businesses. There are some \u2013 of different characters, though, it's broadening our portfolio down to get some that are doing really well and others that we'd like to do better, and because we have high aspirations. So you'll see this quarter, the Allstate Dealer Services which has got almost 4 million policies out there. Its profit turned up. It used to make a lot more than it made this quarter. So we'd like to see it make more. But it made more than it did last quarter \u2013 its losses I think actually last year. So it's a \u2013 overall, though, we feel good about all those businesses. One business you didn't mention which is our Annuity business, where their results are down this quarter because the performance-based investments, the returns were down. That said, even though performance-based investments were down, the yield on an annualized basis was still 9%. So we're feeling good about that. John can talk about it if you have an interest. But we feel good about where it is in total. Overall, that Annuity business continues to earn well returns on capital because you have to put so much cap up. We've talked about that in the past. We're trying to come up with ways to put up less capital so we can raise the return as well as by investing differently. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : That's helpful. And just a serious question, opening question, closing the loop. One of your large competitors yesterday on the issue of declining frequency observed that the industry is \u2013 because of the volatility of frequency, competitors tend not to factor in down frequency in future pricing actions. I was just wondering, you lowered your guidance for the range because of lower frequency. Are you factoring in negative frequency? I suspect not, into your thought process for prospective pricing actions. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Well, everybody prices differently, Bob. So I don't \u2013 it's hard to tell what people do. What I would tell you is that we look at total loss costs, which includes everything from underwriting expenses to loss costs which of course are a combination of frequency and severity. If you were to look at a graph of percentage change year-over-year of frequency and severity, you would see that they have \u2013 it's what we'll call the alligator chop because it's gotten wide. And so, severity's continued to go up at sort of an inflationary level. And that 4% plus depending which numbers you're looking at whereas frequency has gone down. Pricing on that kind of basis and assuming the lower frequency is there usually means you're going to get caught in the jaws. Because at some point, the frequency could come back and the severity's not going away. So we tend to look at it on a long-term basis. Everybody does it their own way now. If frequency is down and stays down, where we take less and fewer price increases in the future, sure, and you see that this year. It doesn't really \u2013 from a shareholder value creation standpoint, it still earns really high returns even at our old guidance, which we tried to let people know in first quarter. It earns really, really high returns at this level so we're comfortable with the way we position. And I can't really speak to what the other competitors or I'd listen to their call as well and other people think as well. Yeah, let's take one more call \u2013 question. Can we do that? Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is now open. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Yes, thanks. So Bob asked the question I was looking for. So, Tom, just to kind of clarify things here. Your pricing decisions right now that you're looking at for auto insurance book, you're kind of pricing in line with what you think loss trend is going to look like here going forward? You're not purposely providing below loss trend because you're looking for some market share gains? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: No, our growth \u2013 and I want to make sure we underline this, our \u2013 more than two-thirds of our growth in policies in force came from retention. So we didn't really get into new business discount and all that kind of stuff and loss ratio on that. But we're very comfortable with our growth and our profitability at this point because of how and why we're getting our growth, whether that's the retention in which customers we're retaining, which states we're retaining them in, or where our new businesses come from, whether that be risk class, state-based stuff. So we're comfortable that, we're in good position. We're not attempting to lower profitability to grow. That's not our \u2013 that's not been our strategy. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Right. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: So, thank you all. Let me close. I know it's past the hour. We had a strong first half. So, we look forward to catching up with you next quarter. We're going to stay focused on our operating priorities to make sure we balance both the long- and short-term initiatives, so we can create more value for our shareholders, for our customers, and all our other stakeholders. So, thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Allstate's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. John Griek - The Allstate Corp.: Well, thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to Allstate's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. After our prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we filed the 10-Q for the third quarter and posted the news release, investor supplement, and today's presentation on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2017 and other public documents for information on potential risks. Now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Good morning. Thank you for joining to stay current on Allstate's operating results. Let's begin on slide 2, so the headline year is Allstate's businesses continued to deliver growth and attractive returns. Our strategy is working. We're on pace to achieve our five 2018 operating priorities. At the Property-Liability, year-to-date underlying combined ratio was at the favorable end of the annual outlook range or for nine months for a close to the bottom of the annual outlook, which is good, as you know. The net result was excellent financial results. We also announced a new $3 billion share repurchase program, of which up to $1 billion may be funded with perpetual preferred stock. To go to the table, revenues increased to $10.5 billion, almost $600 million above the prior year quarter. Net income was $833 million in the third quarter of 2018 and adjusted net income per share was $1.93 million, which is 20.6% increase over the prior year quarter. Net income return on equity for the latest 12 months was 17.4% and 15.9% on an adjusted net income basis. Now, let's start on a more macro perspective before we dig into the details. So if you go to slide 3, Allstate's strategy is to grow market share in the personal Property-Liability businesses while expanding our other protection businesses. So, to start with the upper oval, the personal Property-Liability market has four consumer segments and we serve each of these with a differentiated branded product offering. So Allstate agencies provide customers with personal guidance through 38,000 professionals and over 10,000 agencies in nearly every community in America. The Esurance on the other hand provides over 1.6 million policies to customers who prefer to purchase their products online or through a call center. We use this sophisticated analytics across all these businesses to ensure we grow profitability and are at the forefront to using telematics-based offerings. We're building an integrated digital enterprise that uses data analytics technology and process redesign to improve both our effectiveness and our efficiency. For example, we are a leader in using consumer generated \u2013 or customer generated photos to quickly settle auto insurance claims. Our strategy also includes expanding other protection businesses by leveraging our brands, customer base, investment expertise, distribution and capital, which are listed in the lower oval and that obviously began in 1957 with life insurance. In 1999, we acquired Allstate Benefits, which provides protection product such as life and disability insurance to employees at the work site. And by leveraging our resources, this business has had a compound annual growth rate of 7% for 18 years. We purchased SquareTrade at the beginning of 2017 and it's growing rapidly and achieving our acquisition objectives. And this year, we also began offering insurance to transportation networks companies such as through Allstate business insurance. And we recently closed the acquisition of InfoArmor, which further expands our portfolio of person identity protection products and services. So, this two part strategy then creates shareholder value in a number of different ways through customer satisfaction, unit growth, attractive returns on capital. It also ensures we have sustainable profitability and a diversified business platform. So, if you turn to slide 4 then as to what we're doing in 2018, the operating priorities we communicate to you and to our employees and teammates. The first three priorities, better serve customers, achieve target economic returns on capital and grow the customer base. They're intertwined to ensure profitable long-term growth. So, customers were better served as the Net Promoter Score improved across all of our major business. Higher customer retention then at Allstate, Esurance and Encompass, as Property-Liability businesses is driving growth. Our returns remain excellent. The Property-Liability recorded combined ratio of 94.3 generated $473 million of underwriting income for the quarter. Allstate Life, Allstate Benefits generated adjusted net income returns on capital of 12.4% and 14.9%, respectively. The overall adjusted net income return on equity was 15.9% for the latest 12 months. The growth increase as the \u2013 as Allstate and Esurance, Property-Liability brands grew policies in force as a result of the higher retention I just mentioned and increased new business. Allstate Benefits continued its long track record of growth with policies in force increasing 5.1% over the prior year quarter. SquareTrade added 18.1 million policies over the last 12 months. The $84 billion investment portfolio generated $844 million of net investment income in the third quarter with a total return of 1.1%. Well, we made good progress building long-term growth platforms. SquareTrade continued to deliver on the success measures we established at acquisition. And the $525 million purchase of InfoArmor will accelerate our expansion into new protection category. The connected car strategies are also gaining momentum with increased utilization of telematics in the Allstate and Esurance, auto insurance businesses. In addition, Arity has substantially expanded its data collection and now has over 55 billion miles of data, which is growing at almost 9 billion miles per month. Slide 5 provides more information on InfoArmor for those of you who were not able to tie into our call on that. The InfoArmor acquisition closed on October 5 and accelerates our expansion identity protection. What it does? It provides identity protection products, primarily through voluntary employee benefits channel, which has very attractive acquisition economics. And in an increasingly connected world, customers' needs for these products are expected to grow rapidly and this positions us with a much broader product offering. There are also excellent expansion opportunities used in the Allstate Benefits platform. As we've done with other acquisitions, we've established the measures of success. So it both directs our operating priorities and gives us the basis for conversation with you, so InfoArmor is expected to continue to grow rapidly in the voluntary benefits channel including leveraging the Allstate Benefits platform. Long-term success will also require expanding the product offering and broadening distribution. And lastly, the acquisition should be accretive to adjusted net income by 2021. John will now go through our Property-Liability results in more detail. John Griek - The Allstate Corp.: Thanks, Tom. On slide 6, you can see that Property-Liability results remain strong. Net written premium increased 5.9% in the third quarter, driven by accelerated growth in the Allstate and Esurance brands. The recorded combined ratio of 94.3 was 0.4 points higher than the third quarter of 2017 due to higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses in homeowners, increased growth-related expenses and small net unfavorable non-catastrophe prior year reserve re-estimates versus a large positive benefit in the prior-year quarter. This was partially offset by lower catastrophe losses and improved auto insurance accident frequency. Unfavorable non-catastrophe prior year reserve re-estimates of $12 million reflected $113 million in favorable re-estimates for Allstate Protection auto and homeowners insurance, which was more than offset by $42 million of adverse development in commercial auto for policies written in 2015 and 2016, and an $80 million increase in Discontinued Lines and Coverages reserves based on our annual review. The three year survival ratio for asbestos, environmental and other is 10.2 as of September 30, 2018. Non-catastrophe prior year reserve changes for the first nine months of 2018 increased underwriting income by $178 million versus a positive impact of $312 million for the same period in 2017. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior year reserve re-estimates, was 86.6 for the third quarter of 2018. This was 2 points above the prior year quarter. As you know, our underlying combined ratio guidance is for the full year, and for the first nine months of the year, the underlying combined ratio was 85.4, at the favorable end of the annual outlook range of 85 to 87. For the first nine months of 2018, the underlying combined ratio increased 0.8 compared to the prior year. Slide 7 covers operating results for Allstate brand auto insurance, where policies in force increased and margins were similar to last quarter. Starting with the bottom left chart, policies in force grew by nearly 400,000 or 2% in the third quarter of 2018. The renewal ratio of 88.7 was an improvement of 1 point from the prior year quarter, benefiting from our focus on improving the customer experience and a stable rate environment. New issued applications grew year-over-year for the seventh consecutive quarter, increasing 16% compared to the third quarter of 2017. As you can see in the right-hand box, the recorded combined ratio for the third quarter was 92.9, 1.8 points better than the prior year quarter and generated $368 million in underwriting income. This includes over $90 million in favorable prior year reserve re-estimates in the third quarter. The primary drivers of profitability improvement were increased average earned premium, lower catastrophe losses and a broad-based decline in accident frequency, partially offset by higher claims severity, particularly in the property damage coverage. Claims severities have been slightly above general inflation trends as more sophisticated cars increased both repair costs and the number of total losses. The underlying combined ratio of 92.5 in the third quarter of 2018 included an underlying loss ratio of 66.8 and was in line with the second quarter performance, as accident frequency trends remained favorable. Slide 8 covers Allstate brand homeowners insurance results, which continued to generate attractive returns. Starting in the bottom left, policies in force grew 1.2% compared to the prior year, as both the renewal ratio and new issued applications increased. The bottom right chart provides detail on profitability. The homeowners insurance recorded combined ratio was 88 in the third quarter. Performance for this line is better evaluated over a 12-month period, given weather seasonality and variability. Allstate brand homeowners insurance generated $826 million of underwriting income with a recorded combined ratio of 88.1 over the last 12 months. The underlying combined ratio of 65.4 in the third quarter of 2018 was slightly above our target and was primarily driven by adverse non-catastrophe weather-related losses. Slide 9 provides financial highlights for Esurance and Encompass. Esurance continued to accelerate growth while improving underlying profitability in the quarter. Esurance net written premium grew 14.6% compared to the prior year quarter. This reflects increased average premium in auto and homeowners insurance and a 7.4% increase in total policies in force due to higher retention and new issued applications in auto insurance. The increase in new issued applications is partially due to additional marketing spend in the third quarter. Homeowners net written premium grew 25% in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting an increased focus on a multi-line product offering. The recorded combined ratio of 102.1 in the third quarter was 2.3 points better than the prior year quarter, as shown on the upper right, due to the improvement in both the loss and expense ratios. The underlying combined ratio of 99.2 was 1.3 points better than the prior year quarter, as both auto and homeowners insurance results improved. At the bottom, Encompass net written premium in the quarter was in line with third quarter 2017 as the increase in auto and homeowner insurance average premium was offset by an 8% decline in policies in force. Encompass' recorded combined ratio of 96.1 in the third quarter of 2018 with 6.9 points higher than the prior year, partially driven by increased catastrophe losses of $23 million in the quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 89 for the third quarter was 3.5 points higher than 2017's third quarter. This was due to higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses in homeowners insurance and an increased expense ratio. Now, I'll turn it over to Mario. Mario Rizzo - The Allstate Corp.: Thanks, John. We've expanded the section on Service Businesses since their strategic and economic value can get overshadowed by the Property-Liability businesses. Slide 10 highlights the results and measures of success for SquareTrade and Arity. SquareTrade made progress on the three objectives, supporting its acquisition as domestic policies in force increased, loss experience improved and the business is expanding beyond U.S. retail. SquareTrade written premium increased 86.5% to $194 million in the third quarter of 2018 due to the continued growth in U.S. retail, as SquareTrade became the exclusive protection plan provider for a leading U.S. retailer during the quarter. Revenues were $128 million and adjusted net income was $7 million in the third quarter. Arity continues to invest in advancing our telematics platform by providing device and mobile data collection services and analytical solutions to both Allstate affiliated insurance operations and third parties. In the third quarter, Arity had revenues of $22 million, primarily related to affiliate contracts. Active telematics connections increased to 9.6 million, led by the addition of Life360, the world's largest family driving network. Life360's millions of global users better understand their driving behavior and receive personalized insurance offers from utilization of Arity's software development kit. As a result, total miles collected reached 55 billion, which is now increasing at a rate of almost 9 billion miles per month. This additional data enables Arity to provide better insurance risk scores for a broader group of drivers. Slide 11 provides detail for Allstate Dealer Services and Allstate Roadside Services. Allstate Dealer Services provides vehicle financing GAP coverage and vehicle service contracts. It is primarily distributed through auto dealerships. Revenues were $102 million for the quarter and $298 million for nine months. Adjusted net income was $3 million in the third quarter of 2018, benefiting from profit improvement initiatives and improved profitability of the GAP product offering. Allstate Roadside Services provides roadside assistance to Allstate customers and through white label arrangements with third parties such as car manufacturers. It is focused on enhancing the customer experience by providing fast and dependable service using the blended traditional and crowd-sourced rescue network optimized through analytics and mobile technology. Revenues were $77 million for the quarter and are slightly down from the prior year quarter. Expenses associated with the provider networks and technology contributed to a decline in income compared to the prior year quarter. Turning to slide 12, let's review Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuities. Allstate Life generated adjusted net income of $74 million in the third quarter, shown on the bottom left chart. This was due to a lower effective tax rate, higher premiums and increased net investment income. Allstate Benefits adjusted net income, shown in the middle chart on the page, was $32 million in the quarter. The $4 million increase from the prior year quarter was primarily driven by increased premiums and a lower effective tax rate. Allstate Annuities on the right had adjusted net income of $20 million in the quarter, which was $35 million lower than the prior year quarter primarily due to lower performance-based investment results compared to a very strong prior year quarter. Adjusted net income return on equity remained low due to the relatively high regulatory capital requirements. Slide 13 highlights our investment results. The investment portfolio is proactively managed based on relevant market conditions and corporate risk appetite to optimize return per unit of risk. The chart at the lower left of the slide shows net investment income for the third quarter was $844 million, which was flat for the third quarter of 2017. Market-based investment income shown in blue increased slightly and reflects higher purchase yields and a modest duration extension for the fixed income portfolio, partially offset by a reduced allocation to high-yield bonds. Performance-based investment income shown in gray generated $214 million of income in the third quarter, a decrease of 6% over strong prior year quarter, primarily reflecting more moderate asset appreciation. Our performance-based investments, which have increased over the last few years, now total $8 billion to almost 10% of the total portfolio. The components of total return are shown in the table on the lower right. The positive 1.1% return in the quarter was supported by a stable contribution from income shown in blue and positive equity valuations shown in red. Those were slightly offset by lower fixed income valuations due to increased market yields shown in gray. The 12-month trailing return for the period was 2.1%. Slide 14 provides an overview of returns and capital. We continue to generate attractive returns on capital. Adjusted net income return on equity, shown in the bottom left chart, was 15.9% for the 12 months ended September 30, an increase of 2 points compared to the prior year period. Book value per share increased to $60.79 or 9.2% since the third quarter of 2017, as higher earnings and a 4.1% reduction in shares outstanding offset the impact of dividends, share repurchases and a decline in fixed-income on realized gains and losses. Our capital position remains strong and we returned $385 million to common shareholders in the third quarter, bringing the total cash return to shareholders for the first nine months to $1.6 billion, as you can see in the bottom right chart. We continue to proactively manage our capital. Yesterday, the board authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to conclude by the end of April 2020. The new program may be funded by potential preferred stock issuances of up to $1 billion. Additionally, we closed on the acquisition of InfoArmor on October 5 for $525 million and redeemed $385 million of our preferred shares on October 5. Now, we'll open up the line for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question, please? Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : My first question, you guys saw higher non-cat weather losses in your homeowers book both in Allstate brand and in Encompass. Can you just talk through what you think was causing that in the quarter? And kind of the outlook there, do you think that that's something that you expect to continue or are you going to take more price in the business or what's the outlook, I guess, for the margins for the homeowners business that we should think about in the fourth quarter and beyond? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Elyse, thanks for the question. It's obviously something we've looked at. I'll give you just a quick overview and then Glenn can take you through the specifics of the quarter. The homeowners business continues to generate really attractive returns for us. So, 88 combined ratio, $574 million of underwriting income over the last 12 months. Obviously, amounts move in between various categories, whether that's catastrophes or other related losses, and you have a lot of volatility embedded deep in homeowners. The net of all that, though, is we're very comfortable with the business and to the extent we have to raise price in various states, we will do that. Glenn can talk about the specific of the quarter. Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Tom. Yeah, I'll just add on that. It's interesting if you look at the weather patterns for the year and we mentioned in the last quarter that we were at the upper end of our underlying target that we have for homeowner and then we went a little bit above that this quarter. There is some shift between catastrophe, non-catastrophe losses. If you look at the overall weather events, we got a similar number of weather events during the year, but more of them are not triggering a catastrophe rating and few of them are triggering catastrophe. We see there's some shift between those. Said another way and put kind of simply, we got more rain and less hail this year. And as an overall result, we produced like in the quarter an 88 combined ratio, which is pretty favorable, but we see some shift between those numbers. It is something we're keeping an eye on. We do have areas of the country, as you know, we take rate views state-by-state, we have areas that we do have need and we are moving on those needs for rate in those local markets, but broadly we feel, as Tom said, very comfortable with our overall profitability in homeowners. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then my second question on your auto business. Within the Allstate brands, you guys have been taking less rate as you really \u2013 testament you've been able to really improve the margins of that business. And so, as we start to think about potentially \u2013 and you saw higher severity in the quarter and still beneficial frequency, but it seems like that's not necessarily expected to continue, do you think we're still in an environment where your rates can more or less, say, stable as you pursue growth? Or do you see maybe a higher severity trends having an impact on your rating levels from here? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Elyse, I would answer that. We don't really project what the rates will be. We react to what cost and trends are and so we're adjusting as necessary. And we're getting a really good return in the auto business today, we like that returns and so we're growing the business. So, we're comfortable with the overall profitability. And as whether frequency doesn't continue, go down or severity goes up a little more, we factor all of that in. As you know, the paid numbers that you see in the supplement are up this quarter, but that's really only one little component we use to establish profitability and we feel good about the results that we have. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please? Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I sort of want to build on Elyse's question. And first of all, we have to recognize that you are indeed achieving targeted returns across your business, but I was looking at page 3 of your press release, and specifically the chart where you talk about the underlying combined ratios and it looks like in five of the seven categories on an underlying basis you're reporting an uptick not only in the third quarter 2018 but also on the nine-month basis. And so, as we think about the future for Allstate, analysts are always focused on the sustainability of your current results, and so perhaps you could provide us a perspective on how you see these trends and what we should be thinking about going forward? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Sure, Greg. Let me answer it in a couple of different ways. First, we feel very good about the returns we're getting in the business and that the results this year are in line with what we expected. So, as you know, we don't give earnings guidance, but as a result of that, you all have to make estimates. To help you do that, we give you an underlying combined ratio, but that's only one part of the picture. And then, what we do is give you a whole bunch of detailed information under that to enable you to even make a more specific pick. And I think in some ways that it's necessary, we believe we need to be fully transparent, but in another ways we can kind of sometimes drag it down into the micro. So, your question is really about the macro. And when you look at the auto insurance business, so the combined ratio of 93, that's a 7 point pre-tax margin. In addition, given the timing of the claim payouts, you get a little investment income on top of that. When your premium to surplus ratio can run above 3 to 1, you can do the math relatively quickly and on an after tax basis, that's a really high return on capital at 93 or any other number. And so we're about creating shareholder value. We feel good about that. The components change over time and that's both within a line and then, as you point out, across the line. That's why we give you an underlying combined ratio for the whole company. But the bottom line is, all that is very good. There are things that happened that you see in the numbers that I'm sure caused you some issues. So when you look at the paid severity, for example, on property damage, that's up, and we're watching up, what I would tell you is that's just one component that's paid. We don't actually book to pays. We book to what we think the number will be. That then helped to us, but we're actually booking at a slightly higher level than you would see in paid because property damage is only 12% of premiums anyway. So, by giving you that information, what I can tell you is we feel good about the profitability of auto insurance. We feel good about its outlook going forward and we've shown an ability over time to adjust and get attractive returns on capital. Not included in that, sometimes when you're looking forward, what are the positive that don't show up in that investor supplement, in higher interest rates should help raise that investment component for auto insurance going forward. So, we feel good about our ability to generate a good return from the auto business. The homeowner business is slightly different, and it really does build on Elyse's question, which is \u2013 so we have a 12 point margin in homeowners insurance. You don't get as much investment income because obviously you pay the claims out a lot faster, but \u2013 and it requires a little higher capital. That said, with the margin that's 5 points higher than auto insurance, it still also generates a really attractive return on capital and we feel good about that business. And while it bounces around a lot between the components, which we show you and you see and we talk about because we have \u2013 we benefit from a lot of \u2013 from little turnover in our analyst core and you know auto business really well, so as a result of that, sometimes we get dragged down into the micro pieces that I would say, let's come up a little bit. And that's a really high return on capital in the homeowners business. And I would point out is, over the last year, it's 13 points higher, the margin, which then a big competitor of ours who is growing quite rapidly and everybody is excited about, and we're like, well, like you should be excited if you're growing a business that's making a good return, not for sure, if you're not making a great return. So we feel good about our current returns, we feel good about our competitive position and we expect to stay there going forward. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you for that thoughtful answer. As a follow, maybe just drill down on the difference between new issued application growth and PIF count growth. And it looks both Esurance and Allstate in the autos components that you're booking some really nice gains on new issued applications, but the PIF count growth is a little bit slower, and perhaps you could spend a minute and help us reconcile those different trends. Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: Yeah, this is Glenn. I'll answer for Allstate. We like where we are from a growth perspective and it kind of ties into your last question, Tom's answer too, because what gets lost when we're talking about the returns and everything is we're getting more competitive as this moves in and we are winning in the marketplace. So when you look at the year-over-year growth, whether it's the 2% in auto or the 1.2% in home, both of those are being driven right now about 60% by retention. So we're keeping customers that we fought hard to attract in the first place. And about 40% of it is being driven by the increase in applications that you refer. So it's actually a heavier drift from the retention component. But the new business coming in, very favorable as well and it's a result of us being more competitive. I'm not sure if that split answers your question, but that's where we're seeing it come from. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: So if you look it on an Encompass perspective, we're growing our new business off a very low base. We took a lot of strong actions in order to right size the business given profitability and shrunk the business. So now, we have over half the states in the country and a little under half of our premium in those states are now in a growth mode. We're trying to balance profitability and growth. And we're still trying to manage profitability in half the country. In terms of PIF, obviously, we're still going down, but we're going down a lesser rate now, so we feel good on... Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: You're talking about Encompass. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Encompass. Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: Yeah. Okay. I thought he asked about Esurance. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Oh, I'm sorry. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's okay. You can keep going on Encompass and then hit... (33:13) Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: I got too many Es. So Encompass, obviously, if you look at the premium is now stabilized. We're still going down in (33:22). We think that that is slowly getting better as that decline is being reduced. So from Esurance perspective obviously, we're having really good results. We have, as you noted, new business is going up quite high. It's very similar to Allstate. Our retention has done very well for us, which is driving a fair amount of that growth, but we're also, because of new advertising campaign and we think a strong price competitiveness in the marketplace, we are situated very well to continue grow that business. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That is helpful. Maybe you could just spend a minute, and just as a follow-up and just comment on the commercial lines because I think that's where the alliance with Uber is coming in, et cetera? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah. So if you look at commercial lines, virtually all of the increase in written premium for the quarter and for the year is due to the relationship with Uber. And that, we had started with three states last March. We added New York at the end of the second quarter, or early beginning of the third quarter. So you see the, I believe, $58 million roughly of premium in the third quarter. It's how we look out over the next couple of quarters at least. We feel really good about that business. We've established a good relationship with the management and we believe we're getting good driver scores and all as we look at our performance in terms of claims with the underlying Uber drivers. So we feel good about where that business is and we would love to continue to grow that business over time. John Griek - The Allstate Corp.: Okay. Thank you, Greg. Can we go to the next question? Operator : Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley, Your question, please? Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. My first question is just a follow-up on the severity trends. So it's going up a little bit. I just wonder how does that compare with your expectation. And also, you don't disclose the BI severity anymore, if anything on that front as well. Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: Yes. Thank you. This is Glenn. So it is in line with our expectation and it's interesting. As Tom said before, when you think about what you see in our release on a quarterly basis, the paid severity, last quarter, you saw 3.7. We look at a lot of different trends underneath that. We're breaking down all the different coverages between property damage, collision, comprehensive, we're breaking down parts and labor and future trends, and we're booking to a number beyond that. So, when the shift between the second and third quarter from a 3.7 to 7.7, we really see it in a more smooth basis of looking at it. It's about 5 or a little over 5 for the full year. Now, that compares to a longer-term trend for both the industry and Allstate closer to 4. So it is elevated. Like, we do see some pressure across the industry in the property damage lines. And what's moving the physical damage is higher repair costs, which is in the disclosure and John mentioned earlier with more sophisticated cars, with more expensive parts and then also an elevation in total losses. And those two things are connected because what has happened is repairs have accelerated a little faster than the values of cars. So naturally, if the repairs go up more than the cost of the cars, then you trigger total loss on more vehicles. And again, it's something we've seen across the industry. And the key for you, I think, is it's baked into our numbers. So when you see our combined ratios, it's in there, our projection to what we're seeing from an ultimate loss trend standpoint. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: What about BI side? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Well, I'm sorry, on the BI. Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: We don't disclose BI, but it would be slightly above general inflation. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's great. My follow-up on that is that as you see your pricing sort of increases slowing down, but those \u2013 like a claim severity and frequency less favorable, but frequency trending up, over long-term, last few years, you have seen your underlying combined ratio have improved from 89% back in 2015 now to 85%-ish. So will we see that ratio drift higher in the coming years? And will you also consider \u2013 Tom, you mentioned your investment income is going higher. Will that also be part of the consideration what your target of your underlying combined ratio? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: I would come back to the conversation we were having with Greg and Elyse, which is our mission is to earn a excellent return on capital for our shareholders on all of our lines. We have done that on auto insurance for a long period of time. When something happens that's unexpected, we take actions pretty quickly and focusing first on protecting returns, second on growth. That's kind of been our mantra. So I don't really see any change in that going forward. So we don't \u2013 it's about getting good returns for shareholders. And as these pieces bounce around, Glenn actually mentioned to me, it's a little bit like having investment portfolio, some pieces go up, some pieces go down, but in total, we're getting you a good total return on auto insurance and we expect to continue to do that. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your question, please? Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse : Hi, thanks. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned telematics. I'm not sure if you mentioned increased use of it. But maybe you can just shed light on the goal in terms of penetration for telematics. Are you providing incentives to your agency force to sell it? Just kind of curious how to think about the growth of that over time. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Mike, you should expect the penetration to go up over time. We're pushing hard at it. We have a series of efforts underway in the Allstate and Esurance brands to do that aggressively. We'd like to move that into the Encompass brand as well. We want to do that first and foremost, because it's really good for the customers. We can give them a more specific price for them. So, for example, right now, you estimate where somebody's driving based on where the car is garaged. With telematics we can determine exactly where you drive not just where it's parked. There are other things that we've expanded the telematics offering to include Milewise. So if you live in New Jersey and you haven't seen our ads, as you come across the ferry or in the subway, I'm like really depressed, because people like to \u2013 some people like to pay by the mile. They have to pay to have the car covered in case like something happens to it or something steals while it just sitting, but then some people like to pay by the mile. So it gives us the ability to give a highly specific, individualized price tailored to how they want to use their car. We're also using it to improve the driving experience. So that includes everything, like just telling them how to be a safer driver, to maybe some location-based offers to them, car health stuff that we're working on, you heard about the Life360 stuff that Mario mentioned. So we expect to use telematics at an increased rate. Now, it's not that easy to get from just offering it to getting it used. So we have a number of ways in which we do that. We were first in the market with the mobile app, which is the easiest, lower customer barrier to use. It doesn't enable you to connect the car though due to (41:32) So we'll work through that. We do not pay special incentives to agency owners to get them do it because we believe this is in our customers best interest. But getting them from saying yes to getting them to be connected requires a different set of processes. And we do that differently at Esurance than we do at Allstate, but you should expect that number to continue to go up. I believe that in the future, this will be the primary driver of insurance pricing in auto insurance because it's every bit as powerful as credit. And those who have been hanging around auto insurance like I have for a while, credit sort of ripped through the industry and pricing in the early part of the 2000. And this is a little harder to implement because it requires a customer to do something rather than just buying data from TransUnion or some like that, but it's equally as powerful. So it will happen Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse : Okay. That's helpful. And my follow-up is regarding personal auto. Earlier you were kind of walking us through the high level economics and you mentioned a 3 to 1 surplus levels what you guys have always kind of been held to. Given your track record of stable profitability, can that ratio ever move higher one day? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Let me make a general comment about how we think about capital and Mario can talk about specifically about auto insurance. So, over the last decade, we've built a highly sophisticated set of econometric models to help us determine capital at the individual risk level, even below auto insurance, rolling all the way up to the entire company. So we start with individual risk on a individual basis. Then, there's all kind of diversifications, covariance, all kind of stuff that comes into the numbers. And we use that to price homeowners insurance in Louisiana. We use it. So we're constantly looking at it. Mario can talk about the work we're doing on capital because that is something we have had a long track record on, which is effectively sourcing capital whether that be cat bonds, perpetual preferred or anything else, so we look at it in a lot of different ways. Mario Rizzo - The Allstate Corp.: Yes. So, Mike, I think the 3 to 1 comment Tom made was kind of historical industry kind of metric that's thrown around. We, as Tom mentioned, I think, take a far more sophisticated and economic approach to capital requirements when we look at the underlying risks in a particular business and attribute specific levels of capital that add risk. And based on that, we think we are earning really attractive returns in auto and will continue to do so. So I think your question around can it move up over 3 to 1, I think our view based on what we think the economic requirements for auto is, it's probably already there. And the returns that we're achieving in that business are really attractive. And then, in terms of sourcing capital for the business over time, I'd say we're constantly looking at ways to improve the return profile really across all of our businesses. And sometimes that means using other people's capital that have different return profiles and different return targets than we might for a business. It's more efficient to use that kind of capital. We've done that in the property business with cat bonds and reinsurance. We'll continue to explore it in other lines of businesses to continue to kind of sculpt the return profile and enhance both the efficiency of our capital structure and the returns that we get on our businesses. Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Your question, please? Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thanks and good morning. The first question I have- Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Amit, could you speak up just a little bit? It's a little - Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Is it better? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah, that's fine. Thank you. Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Sorry. The first question goes back to the discussion on the claim severity side. I was wondering if we could look at it from a different manner. Can you talk about \u2013 when you look at the new business and the age of the vehicle that is insured, I would assume that there is a very strong correlation between new business and recently manufactured cars. And if that is the case, with ADAS now being standard, could we be surprised by these claim severities continuing to tick up faster than initially anticipated? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: First, the new business is not always new cars. So some renewals are newer cars and obviously, some new business, there are older cars. So we do do make and model pricing. Glenn can talk about the new to renewal loss ratio relative to... Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Yes. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: ... if we look at \u2013 evaluate the profitability of new business. And then, I would say, as it relates to the future, I would come back to the part of \u2013 like, if we see it, we price for it. Glenn T. Shapiro - Allstate Insurance Co.: Yeah. Thank you, Amit. Taking a couple of different ways here. One, just from the balance of new business or balance of growth that we're getting, I'll again say, 60% of our growth is being driven by retention. So that's a really balanced way to grow, 40% is based on new business. And when we look at the new business from a risk profile, we feel good about where we are from the type of risk we're bringing on, the full coverage, the bundled policies and the risk trades that we bring on. So, all of those have been favorable to our expectations. So, as we look at new to renewal, it's performing as we expected and we're very comfortable with the growth. In terms of your comments on newer cars, as we look at data \u2013 and it is one of the things we look relative to all of our trends. How many cars we have in each cohort? The average car in the car park out there right now is about 11.5 years old. So, that moves over time, every year, it moves forward about a year. And what we're actually seeing is we're right in line with what you'd expect. Every year, we get about a year newer. It just moves exactly about the way you expect it to move and we're not seeing major shifts along those lines. Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got it. That's actually very helpful. The other question, and the only other question I have, is on the broader discussion on Amazon and Travelers. And I know it's early days in this change. I'm curious would Allstate have an opportunity to partner with them? And with this although being in early stages, does longer time, does this change the margin dynamics with Amazon and maybe Jet.com and Walmart having these partnerships? Thanks. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Well, Well, first, we go where the customer goes. So, where the customer wants to be, that's where we'll be. And, as you know, we have four different approaches to doing that. Those who want to go to a local agency do via Allstate and a branded product. Those who want to do direct, Esurance. And those who want to go through independent agency, don't really care about the brand, go to Encompass. And then, we don't talk much about Answer Financial, which is our online aggregator, which I believe is probably the biggest in the country or if it's not the biggest, it's second biggest. And we've been using Arity's data to make it a two-sided advertising platform. So, we have some work to do. So, we will go wherever the customer wants to go. As it relates to Amazon, SquareTrade is a major player on the Amazon platform, protection policy. So, it's a good piece of business for us. We like working with them. We know how to compete aggressively by changing prices every 15 seconds or something there, we need to. So we're open to doing it whichever way. And I would say, what we've tried to do, Amit, is build a model that's flexible, that leverages those core capabilities that they're in middle of those two ovals and use them to go wherever we want. So, if you look at the transportation network companies, our claims experience is of great value to those companies because we're really good at claims, particularly bodily injury claims. And so we're happy to sell insurance to Uber and thrilled about it, and like the partnership and like to grow it. So we'll go wherever the customer goes. Amit Kumar - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Got it. Thanks for the answer and good luck for the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your question, please? Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, two questions for you. First one, Tom, just curious, ad spend really kicking up here. Understand, profitability is great and you want to maximize the amount of business you can get at these profitability levels. But should we kind of expect those levels to continue here going forward? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Brian, are you talking about the actual reported combined ratio? Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : No, I'm looking at ad spend. Just looking at amount of - Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Oh, I'm sorry, ad spend. I missed that part of the question. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Apologize, yeah, advertising. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah, advertising. Well, it's different by brand, right. So, Esurance has dialed up their advertising spend this quarter. And as Steve (51:35) mentioned, that's led to really good results. We're up 7% in units over last year. We like that. We've also launched new advertising in the Allstate brand and the early read on that advertising is it's effective, and we like it. So, as that works, we'll roll out. Now, I would say, that the spend is one thing to think about, but it's also like where do you spend and how do you spend. And that's where you can increase your effectiveness and your efficiency and where we use a lot of math to decide, should it be on TV, where you and everybody else sees it or is it better in a highly specific and a targeted lead or ad that we buy. So, we look at it in total. For competitive reasons, we don't give out ad spend on a forward-looking basis. I would say we like what we see. We want to keep growing. So you probably won't see it come down, how about that. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Good, make sense. And then, another one a little longer-term thinking here. Tom, I'm just curious with the legalization of cannabis in more and more states and in Canada, what are you guys' thoughts with respect to the potential that will have on claims frequency trends or will it have any? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Well, I think it will, obviously, if it leads to increased consumption of cannabis, that obviously will impact accidents. And we've seen that a little bit in the states where it has been rolled out. It's a little hard to distinguish. You can't really tell how much of it is because somebody smoked a joint and how much because it was icy outside. But it does appear to have a positive impact being a negative, like increased (53:26) frequency. Unclear on severity just yet. And so we'll price for it. When it's legal, whatever is legal is legal. I think the bigger issue there is from a fairness in society standpoint, if somebody is driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, the person who is hurt is supposed to be taken care of by that person who caused the problem. And with drunk driving, it's relatively easy with breathalyzers to tell at this moment in time, the person was inebriated and therefore, that led to the cause, and so that then leads to damages, some of which we have to pay for because we're insuring those people, some of which are things that happened to our customers and we have to spend them in court, which we do to make sure they get the right amount of money back. The more complicated piece on cannabis is there's not an immediate test when someone's driving. So, you can't blow into a breathalyzer and tell whether somebody is under the influence of cannabis. So, we'd like to see some science brought to bear on it. I'm sure science can solve the problem. But if we've decided as a society that it's legal to use these drugs, then we should make sure that the infrastructure around making sure people are held accountable for their individual actions is improved. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Glasspiegel from Janney Montgomery. Your question, please? Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Good morning, Allstate; question, we've had a little bit of a meltdown in equities, risk assets being marked down. Some are nervous about trends in private equity, others aren't. What are you doing in general on risk relative to the investment portfolio? And if there was a meltdown in private equities, how much liquidity could you raise? John Griek - The Allstate Corp.: Yeah. Hi, this is John. Thanks for the question. I think, first, it makes sense to take a step back and think about how we own all the assets in our portfolio. We're highly integrated. We talked about the capital framework. Mario did earlier and Tom did. We're highly integrated in how the firm thinks about capital across the board. When it comes to any risk asset, performance-based or private equity being one of them, we tend to take a longer-term view on those assets. And they match up quite well versus our overall liability structure, of which some of that is quite long in terms of its duration. I'd take a step back. While we are seeing volatility in this particular year, we saw a flash kind of late January through middle of February and a little bit this month, which we've subsequently recovered slightly from. Equities over the last three years have returned 17% per annum over that three year period. So, we really take a long run view. Now, having said that, we do think about it. And we have \u2013 about half of our equity exposure is in public equities, which you're going to see more immediate pricing in. When you look at our performance-based assets, it's not right to think of them as any one thing. We tend to go into more idiosyncratic risk. We go into different parts of the world. We go down in market cap structure, so smaller companies. We also in there have things like real estate, infrastructure, agriculture, farm land. So, it's fairly diversified. So, it tends \u2013 the transformation and the valuation of those properties tend to take place over multiple years. It's not just a beta along with the equity market. There's a fundamental transformation of value that takes place that at times we're very involved in. So we look at it. We have a lot of leverage in the portfolio to adjust, not only in private equity but in other areas. It's more likely that we would adjust in public markets because the transaction costs would be lower. And we have more than sufficient, adequate capital and liquidity to deal with any such event. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Thank you. I had to step away for a fire drill. Did you quantify the non-cat weather impact in either of the overall combined ratio or homeowners? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: No. It's really hard to do, Bob, as you know. You can look at, the underlying combined ratio excludes cat, it's up. It's up and for a whole variety of reasons, some of which is weather. But to determine weather, that was the rainstorm in Des Moines, or what that would have been last year and how that related to the prior three or four years, we've not done. It's really impossible to do. What we have said is the business earns an 88 combined ratio, a 12 point margin, really good returns. And we feel comfortable with it. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Cool. Just trying to get a sense - Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: And when we need to raise price, we raise price by state, like it's \u2013 not every state the time. Like there are some states where we need to raise homeowner prices, other places where we're earnings even better than average returns. Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Thank you. John Griek - The Allstate Corp.: Jonathan, I know we're at the top of the hour. We'll take one more question. Operator : Certainly. Our final question then for today comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Your question, please? Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. If we were to see an uptick in frequency in auto, how quickly can rates respond? Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: I mean, I would look at what happened in 2015 and 2016 as a way to get an estimate of that. You saw it tick up quickly then, you saw how quickly we could act. And I think we've learned some. I think actually, if we were to relive that story again, we'd spread the rate a little differently. And I think it would \u2013 probably we would have less decrease in the number of units, but we moved about as quickly as you can move, given the regulatory environment in that period of time. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay perfect. Thank you so much. Thomas Joseph Wilson - The Allstate Corp.: Okay. Thank you all for participating. Another great quarter for us where our strategy is working, we're achieving our operating priorities and we're going to keep driving shareholder value. So, we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you. Bye. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. John Griek : Well, thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and welcome everyone to Allstate's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release, investor supplement, posted today's presentation on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain some non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2017 and other public documents for information on potential risks. We are expanding the quarterly earnings call to not only review quarterly operating results but to highlight other value creation initiatives. Today, we will do a deeper dive on our success and using Telematics in auto insurance.  And now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Well. Good morning. Thank you for joining us and stay current on Allstate. Let's begin on Slide 2, Allstate continued to deliver strong operating results, while building the future. We achieved all of our five 2018 operating priorities and we generated excellent returns. The Property-Liability underlying combined ratio of 85.8 for 2018 was better than the range we established with you at the beginning of the year. For 2019, the Property-Liability business is expected to have an annual underlying combined ratio between 86 and 88. And so, if you move down the table at the bottom, revenues excluding realized capital gains and losses were $10.4 billion for the quarter and $40.7 billion for the year, driven by increased insurance premiums in the Allstate and insurance brands. Adjusted net income was $430 million, which was a $1.24 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted net income of $2.9 billion was 15.6% higher than 2017, which reflected strong insurance margins. Net income return on equity was 10.5% and adjusted net income return on equity was 14.8%. If you could turn to Slide 3, we delivered an all five 2018 operating priorities. The first three better serve our customers, achieve target economic returns and capital and grow the customer base are all intertwined, but it does ensure we have profitable long-term growth. Customers were better served as a net promoter score improved across all of our major businesses. Higher customer retention across the three underwriting brands was a key driver of growth last year.  Returns remain excellent. Property-Liability policies increased by 784,000 in 2018, which was a 2.3% increase for the Allstate brand and a 10% growth at all Esurance. When you combined that with a significant growth at SquareTrade, policies in force surpassed the $113 million in 2018. The $81 billion investment portfolio generated $3.2 billion in net investment income in 2018, which uses also slightly higher yield on a market-based portfolio in good performance-based results, which was compared to a very strong 2017. The total portfolio return was 0.8% in 2018, reflecting the stable contribution from net investment income that was offset by lower fixed income equity values particularly at the end of the year. We also make progress in building long-term growth platforms in 2018. I'll discuss telematics next and Mario will discuss SquareTrade's performance. We also accelerated our expansion into personal identity protection with the acquisition of InfoArmor in October. These operating priorities will remain unchanged for 2019. Before we discuss telematics, let me set the context with in our side -- within our overall strategy. So Allstate strategy is to grow by protecting people from life's uncertainty. We start with the upper oval; the personal Property-Liability market has four consumer segments and provides protection by insuring automobiles, homes both in personal liability. We use differentiated products, sophisticated analytics, and telematics in a building in integrated digital enterprise to grow market share in this protection space.  Our strategy also protects people from a range rather uncertainties, which are shown in the bottom oval. We leverage our brands, our customer base, investment expertise, distribution and capital. It began in 1957 with life insurance. In 1999, we acquired Allstate Benefits, which provides protection products, such as life and disability insurance to employees at the work site, that business is now four times its size from when we bought it, and it's with 4.3 million policies in force and adjusted net income of $119 million in 2018. We purchased SquareTrade in 2017, began offering insurance to transportation Network Company last year as well, and recently closed the acquisition of InfoArmor. This strategy creates shareholder value through customer satisfaction, unique growth, and attractive returns on capital. It also ensures we have -- a sustainable profitability and a diversified business platform. If we turn to Slide 5, this quarter, as John said, we want to highlight the value created from the use of telematics and auto insurance. So, we've been investing in telematics for almost a decade to increase auto insurance pricing sophistication, to improve the customer value proposition and leverage our capabilities in data to create a new source of growth and profit. So let's start with what we do now. We began to use telematics in auto insurance in 2010, and now have a suite of products in the market. Drivewise and DriveSense are telematics-based offerings from Allstate in insurance and represent the bulk of our proprietary connection. These products either use a customer's mobile phone or an OBD port device, which goes up underneath the dashboard to establish a connection with the car. We launch Milewise in 2016 in two states expanded to four more states last year, which allows customers to pay for insurance by the mile. StreetWise is offered through our online insurance aggregator Answer Financial in conjunction with Arity to enable other insurance companies to benefit from telematics-based insights. Arity is a telematics service provider to Allstate in a separate from the auto insurance companies. Moving to Slide 6. Auto insurance pricing will eventually be significantly influenced by telematics information, because it's just better than existing approaches. From a pricing standpoint, if you look at the top of that chart, auto insurance policies today are priced by who you are, such as age or gender, and where you live, which is a proxy for where you drive. For example, if your car is registered in Montana, there's a low likelihood you'll be -- commuting about from New Jersey to New York. So telematics though enables pricing to be based on how you actually drive, and telematics is also based on exactly where, when and how much you drive.  So that leads to increase pricing accuracy, lower subsidization between risks and creates a highly personalized risk-based price. Telematics will be required to effectively price auto insurance. Allstate is also using telematics to improve the customer experience by staying connect with customers. We provide customers with awards for safe driving, safe driving tips that can lower their premiums, decode the maintenance, light needing your car 0 :02:13.0 p,9 (inaudible) you know when you have that light comes down to maintenance needed. If you have one of our OBD port devices in your car, we can tell you specifically what's wrong, how serious it is, what is your cost of repair and enable you to link to repair facility. So given these benefits, we believe telematics will be integrated into auto insurance -- insurers business models in the future. As a result, we created Arity outside of the insurance companies to create more value for shareholders. So we turn to Slide 7. In 2015, we defined a strategic platform to help us design Allstate's business model, and you can see that in our 2015 annual report we lay that out. In a strategic platform as a system of capabilities, assets, information and shared intelligence. These platforms have tended to be broad and flexible and create multiple uses for a wide range of customers and partners.  So in our definition, we would consider Apple, Facebook, and Amazon's Marketplace to be examples of platform businesses. Companies that control strategic platforms generate high economic returns. These returns reflect the benefits of reduced friction and cost between participant and the ability to improve returns through increased knowledge and analytics. Platforms are also rapidly scalable. The transportation system can benefit from such a platform. So telematics platform enables companies to increase your speed to market in a connected car world.  If you want to price auto insurance with telematics you need data, which is enabled by a platform. As more companies and industry use Arity, the breadth and depth of data ensured intelligence will grow, more data and a platform allow companies to refine and customize their specific business models, their specific need. So for example, ride-sharing companies can use Arity platform enable them to select safer drivers or better manage your operations.  It also lowers the cost of collecting information. So just like with credit scoring data, it's inefficient to have many companies collecting the same information. We decided to build Arity as a telematics platform to capture important economic benefits. It is little downside to us since we need to build these services for ourselves, because we are so far ahead of most of the industry. Today, Arity has 12.5 million active connections of which more than 1.5 million are through the Allstate entities. They analyze over 300 trips per second and create a proprietary driving score that can be used by insurers or shared mobility companies. Arity scale continues to grow and it's now adding 10 billion miles of driving data per month. Arity generates substantial advantages for Allstate's insurance operations today, and we're actively working with other insurers to help them utilize telematics in auto insurance. We'll keep their information confidential, but all parties benefit from the network effect of a consistent and large data set. It's Arity growth that will also provide us with new sources of revenue from the transformation of the personal transportation system. Now I'll turn it over to Mario, who will discuss our quarterly and annual results in more detail. Mario Rizzo : Thanks Tom. On slide 8, you can see that property-liability results remain strong. Net written premium increased 6.8% in fourth quarter and 6% for the full year, driven by accelerated growth in the Allstate and Esurance brand. Allstate brand auto insurance net written premium grew 5.7% in 2018, reflecting a 2.7% increase in policies in force and higher average premium.  Esurance brand net written premium grew 12.7% in 2018 and policies in force increased 10.4%. The recorded combined ratio of 97 was 6 points higher than the prior year quarter due to higher homeowners insurance combined ratio, primarily from catastrophe losses related to Hurricane Michael and the California wildfires. The auto insurance combined ratio remained solid and higher premiums earned and lower accident frequency more than offset higher physical damage severity. The underlying combined ratio which excludes catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates was 86.8 for the fourth quarter of 2018. This was 1.1 point higher than the prior year quarter primarily due to non -catastrophe weather related losses in Allstate and Encompass brand homeowners insurance. The underlying combined ratio of 85.8 for the year was within the revised annual outlook range of 85 to 87. Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance continue to deliver attractive returns and generated underwriting income of $1.7 billion and $472 million respectively in 2018.  Turning to slide 9, let's review Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuities. Allstate Life shown on the left generated adjusted net income of $68 million in the fourth quarter, up 19.3% from the prior year quarter as lower effective tax rate and higher premiums more than offset higher contract benefit.  Allstate Benefits' adjusted net income shown in the middle chart was $25 million in the fourth quarter. The $5 million increase from the prior year quarter was primarily driven by increased premiums in a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher expenses. Allstate Annuities on the right had adjusted net income of $31 million in the quarter, which was $24 million lower than the prior year quarter. This was primarily due to lower performance based investment income. Moving to slide 10, our Service Businesses continue to provide strategic and economic value. SquareTrade written premium increased 107.1% to $323 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and revenues increased to $137 million. Adjusted net income was $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.  Arity continues to invest and advancing our Telematics platform. In the fourth quarter, Arity had revenues of $24 million, primarily related to affiliate contracts. Allstate Dealer Services revenue was $105 million for the quarter and $403 million for the year. Adjusted net income was $6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, benefiting from improved loss experience.  Allstate Roadside Services revenue was $74 million for the quarter with an adjusted net loss of $7 million in line with the prior year quarter. InfoArmor is the newest addition to the Service Businesses segment contributing over 1 million policies in force. Slide 11 takes a closer look at the acquisition measures of success for SquareTrade. SquareTrade is delivering on the three objectives supporting its acquisition and as domestic policies in force increased, loss experience improved and the businesses expanding beyond US retail. SquareTrade written premium increased 81.5% to $773 million in 2018 due to the continued growth in US retail as SquareTrade became the exclusive protection plan provider for a leading US retailer in the second half of the year.  Adjusted net income was $23 million in 2018 reflecting full year improvement of $45 million. Slide 12 highlights our investment results. We proactively managed the investment portfolio considering market conditions, the nature of our liability and risk appetite. As a result, we have a high quality, market based investment grade bond portfolio that generates substantial annual income and cash flows. We also have a performance based equity portfolio that generate higher returns and longer dated liabilities.  The chart at the lower left shows net investment income for the fourth quarter was $786 million, lower than the fourth quarter of 2017. Market based investment income increased and reflects higher purchase yield and a modest duration extension for the property-liability fixed income portfolio, partially offset by reduced allocation to high yield bond. Performance based investment income generated $145 million of income in the fourth quarter. Performance based income for 2018 was solid with a yield over 9% but fourth quarter was below the prior year quarter reflecting a lower number of sales of underlying investments and more moderate asset appreciation. The components of total return are shown in the table on the right. The negative 0.2% return in the quarter includes the stable contribution from investment income, reduced by lower fixed income and equity valuation. The total return for 2018 was 0.8%. Slide 13, provides an overview of returns and capital. We continue to generate attractive returns on capital. Adjusted net income return on equity shown on the left was 14.8% in 2018, an increase of 1.4 points compared to the prior year. Our capital position remains strong and we returned $1.2 billion to common shareholders in the fourth quarter, bringing the total cash return to shareholders to $2.8 billion for the full year, as you can see in the chart on the right. As part of the $3 billion share repurchase authorization, we executed a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. Additionally, in 2018, we completed the acquisitions of InfoArmor for $525 million and PlumChoice for $30 million, and redeemed $385 million of our preferred shares. We continue to take a proactive approach to managing our capital. Now, we'll open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question please? Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Good morning. My first question is -- just on the severity trends that you're seeing within your auto book, PD severity remained elevated for the second consecutive quarter. If you can just tell us, is it the same factors that you saw driving that last quarter. And then within your underlying margin guide for 2019, are you assuming that severity trends will remain elevated? Tom Wilson : Elyse, this is Tom. So Glenn will answer for the Allstate brand, if you want to go into the other brands, let us know. And as you know, we don't give you -- we don't give breakouts -- in the underlying combined ratio guidance. Glenn Shapiro : Yes. So, thank you, Elyse. I want to start with just a little bit of context on it, and then talk about the issue itself and actions from it. So from a context standpoint, as you know, the losses represent about 70% of the combined ratio and within those losses, because we price Allstate auto in total. You have physical damage about half of it and then you've got the injury coverage, just about half of it. And then within those, you have frequency and severity impacting each of those. So those four quadrants right now, we actually see three of them performing as expected or well, favorable severity in both injury and physical damage, and then the injury lines are performing as expected as you can see in our reserve releases. No question, there's pressure on the physical damage part of it, and they are similar trends to what we saw in the prior. So, the issues in industry wide one, we've seen more sophisticated cars costing more to repair. And as a result of that, particularly at the high-end of repairs, more cars are then reaching sort of that capitation level of a total loss. So you'll see across industry trends, not only in the fast track numbers of overall severity up, you'll see that more cars are reaching a total loss threshold, particularly in recent model years. And I'll give you a specific example just to illustrate, because our team in claims, in our actuaries and our product folks, they do a ton of work getting deep into making model and what's driving different trends.  So a specific example, take a Camry, which is pretty common vehicle, and we look from 2013 through 2018, what the changes were repairing the front-end impact. And the answer is in that five year window, they've doubled. It's the impact of more sophisticated cars with sensors that are actually helping us on the frequency side, but they're costing more to repair. That added $1,700 alone, just the sensors that help avoid accidents. A really specific component taking on that car specifically is the headlight. Headlight went from $360 in 2013 to over $1,900 in 2018 and I give you the specifics and example for two reason; one, is to give you an idea of what's going on and what we see and make a model. Two, is to illustrate we do go deep on this issue and we look at it very thoughtfully. So that takes you to what you do about it. One lever is rate, which obviously we look at on market-by-market basis, where we need to take pricing. The next would be to be more sophisticated and laser focused on that rate. So how do we get better and better -- making model pricing, which we do today, specific making model pricing. But the more we learn, the deeper we go, the more sophisticated we get into specific making model pricing. And the third one would be working with OEMs and their community on improving the overall cost of repair, because as more and more cars are reaching their total loss threshold, I don't think -- there's anybody to have a sort of disposable vehicles, that in the newer model years and we want to be able to repair cars and return them to customers. And answer to the question about whether it's included, we absolutely include all the factors that we look at in giving guidance and it's included retroactively in all of our financials are open and are projected in there. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That's very helpful. And then my second question -- throughout -- very recently we've seen a whole host of transactions in the annuity space as companies have entered into deals that have helped to free-up capital, could you let us know your thoughts would Allstate be interested in entering into transaction with their annuity exposure. And if you did, if there was a transaction that was able to free-up capital, would you be more likely to use that for share repurchase or potentially, to hold on for M&A opportunities? Tom Wilson : Well, Elyse, we obviously don't comment any transactions that people think we could show or maybe or thinking about. So I have no comment on that. What I can tell you is we've always been very aggressive about managing our capital as I'll do the second part first. So whether that's to use -- do share repurchases by companies were better owners than somebody else continue to grow our business. So that part won't change at all, as it relates to that. We have as you know; we've been working hard on improving the long-term economic returns on the annuity business, which have hurt the current book returns. So, specifically, for the payout annuities, which are long dated liabilities, some 20, 30, 40 years? The right way to invest behind those liabilities, much like you would have pension fund, put it mostly in equities, because once you get past 10 years, your return on equities is twice what it is in bonds and your risk is lower. So the downside to that is that the regulators require a significant capital requirement for equity because they think about the equities as being volatile on a day-to-day basis, not on a 10-year basis. So we've been working with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to come up with horizon-based capital standards, particularly as it relates to equities and the payout annuity, which would free-up a tremendous amount of capital, of course that we could then use the way we -- I started to talk about.  So we're looking at every possible way we can improve every element of our capital deployment each and every day, whether that's the annuity business using reinsurance, using preferred stock, buybacks stock. So it's just a part of life for us. So you should know, we're focused on how do we improve returns annuities and thinks that there's opportunities where we can take advantage of when we run forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Ransom from Dowling & Partners. Your question, please. Gary Ransom : Good morning. I'd like to dig in on Allstate brand PIFF growth. You've talked in the past about how it takes time to energize the agents, but we're now seeing more improvement and I'd like to just ask how is that growth spread among the agents. How was subset, is that subset of growing agents building throughout the past year. So maybe that's one part of the question, and another part of the question is, is there any change in the quality of your new customers, are they more bundled or as you talked about more of them using telematics in that process. So sort of two parts of the spread among the agents and then the character of the new customers? Tom Wilson : Okay. Gary, good morning. Let me go up a minute and then come back down to Glenn, if he can answer your specific question on the agency owners, breadth of distribution what we're seeing. So obviously we have a variety of both short and long term strategies to grow and each brand is different and there are differences by geography and by component of the leverage you can have in each of those. So these growth drivers are -- customer satisfaction is up in all of our brands last year and retention is up in all of our brands last year. So that's a big driver of growth, obviously distribution is one you mentioned. There's also the level and quality of our advertising, there's the breadth of our product offering.  And so we pursue those, all of those. So Glenn will talk about the auto home life and Allstate brand. If others want to get into Esurance, Encompass, the transportation network companies, Steve can handle that one. And Don obviously has the servicing businesses. But Glenn, why don't deal with Gary's question directly? Glenn Shapiro : Yes, thanks, Gary. So first talking about the agents. It's really; it's a fun part of what's going on right now in terms of our growth. And it's -- I'd call it a system wide growth because you're touching on an important part because you can see the policy growth, you can see the premium growth but what's really happening underneath that is we've got 2,700 more points of sales. And new agents join us to start the -- our new sales people join an agency because they want to win. They don't start it to stay flat, they want to grow and we're attracting them because right now, we're competitive in the market. There's good health in the system as Tom said, we're retaining more customers which is helpful to the growth. And with those additional points of contact, we have good momentum sort of built into the system and we're growing in a healthy way. And we're competitive in the market. You also asked about the new business coming in and how it's bundling and yes, by telematics. So quickly on those. Bundling has been very favorable, we're bundling more of our new business than we have historically. We also have more people buying full coverage than we've seen historically both of those are good bellwethers for the quality of business. And from a telematics standpoint, we grew that by 30% this year. We added over 300,000 connections, active connections to our Drivewise. And on the Milewise side which is the pay per mile, or Tom mentioned before.  That's -- I think about it like a startup with small numbers but it's growing like crazy. In the fourth quarter alone, we over doubled the size of Milewise as an offering for us. So it's an exciting area where we're growing our business. Gary Ransom : Just as a follow up, are there any areas right now where the PIFF growth is lagging, but has the potential to do better in the future? Tom Wilson : Well, this is Tom. By any -- you mean -- I would say that the -- if you look at the Allstate brand, Glenn's got a number of strategies, different states where he thinks he can grow faster. Obviously, retention is always a benefit that we get from -- Esurance you saw 10% growth last year. So we are feeling good about that. It's back on the --again decent market share gain. Encompass less so, so that would be one where I would say we still need to come up with a sustainable growth plan that drives items in force. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question please. Greg Peters : Good morning. The first question is around the homeowners business and I was looking in your statistical supplement. I think it's page 25 where you had talk about gross claim frequency and paid claim frequency and being up almost double digit in the fourth quarter. They are actually for last couple of quarters it's been up pretty strong. But then I looked at the Allstate homeowners underlying loss ratio and improved in the fourth quarter. So I am trying to sort of bridge the gap there and understand what happened? Tom Wilson : Greg, good morning. Let me -- first let me again I'd like to set a little bit of context. So the Allstate brand homeowner business is very attractive for us, $7 billion of premium, made $470 million of underwriting income in a year, weather a fair amount of catastrophe. So it's a business we like and does well. Obviously, things bounce around from quarter-to-quarter and Glenn can talk about this specific question. Glenn Shapiro : Yes, Greg. I think there is mix there at the quarter-over-quarter versus the year-over-year change. So, yes, it did come down quarter-over -- from the third quarter to the fourth quarter but year-over-year it was up a couple of points in terms of the underlying combined. But to Tom's point, in a year with a lot of catastrophes particularly in the fourth quarter, we produced our recorded combined. And I'd like to go the recorded because we are managing the overall risk over the long-term of catastrophe; it is a big part of what we do. We focus on the underlying. [933] in year that has type of catastrophes we had was pretty strong. And then you have to -- before the fourth quarter you had to go back almost seven years to have a quarter that didn't produced an underwriting profit.  So strong work across the system which is the underwriting approach that we take. It's the pricing, the reinsurance which obviously played a part in fourth quarter for us. And our claims approach that we think ultimately get caught, part of your question relative to the underlying I would say, 2018 was an extremely wet year. I mentioned that in the third quarter, continued into the fourth a bit. It was a heavy, heavy rain year. We got some pricing for that. We reacted to it. We saw the 1.1 growth rate in the fourth quarter which is rate not premium because we do have the automatic inflationary factors in the policies as well. Greg Peters : Thank you for that answer. And then, Tom, I know you highlighted the success of Esurance and I was looking at the underlying loss ratio and I guess it's seasonally high in the fourth quarter, but it certainly seemed to be trending up from what I used to think, it used to like to target in a low 70s. The underlying loss ratio seemed to be pushing up close to the hot now 80. I am wondering if there is anything that I should be thinking about with that loss ratio and underlying loss ratio as it relates to future growth in that business. Steve Shebik : So, Greg, this is Steve. You are absolutely right. Our targets have generally been we said the lower 70s or below 75 range. And for the quarter it was elevated. Couple reasons for that I think is you see one, given the growth we had in the business during 2018; we have a great portion of new customers. There is some higher loss ratio with newer customers. That's only piece of the dollar. Clearly, we have had the same type of issues in terms of severity that we talked about in the Allstate business. And you look at the opposite to that; we brought our expense ratio down, a large amount over the last three years. So in total we are actually have combined ratio on an underlying base below 100 for the whole year.  And for all but the last quarter of the year we had good results. And starting to get profit in the business as we grow. So we feel good about the overall profitability. You are correct. We need to work harder on that --combined ratio and drive it down a little bit from where it is today. And that will accelerate our growth. We feel really good about the growth and the profitability for 2018. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your question please. Mike Zaremski : Hey, good morning. My first question is about auto accident frequency. Can you remind us what Allstate long-term trend has been on frequency and does that differ from your estimate of 2019 frequency? And if does maybe you can talk to why? Tom Wilson : So by long term, speaking of real long term, I am hanging around real for the long time. Mike, I have 15 plus years that just came down pretty steadily as we had third brake light on the car, antilock brakes, airbags, plus some downs so it's just worked on both frequency and severity for a long period of time. Then it kind of playing it down for a while and I am not -- I don't have the exact years in my head but it's kind of flattened out in about 10 years ago. And wasn't really going up for down much than of course in 2015 and 2016 it just fight way up. Still unclear deck as to why that happens somewhat driven by miles -- in miles driven. Some by economic activity which is related to miles driven. There is also when people speculated it's due to like the big cell phone and stuffs like that, distract driving. I think the answer is it's really hard to get attribution as to why. Glenn talked about the decline in frequency since then which is then in part due to less miles drove but also safer cars and some of the trend that were present earlier in that long -term cycle.  So little hard to exactly what it is, as it relates to the forecast for next year, maybe I am sure everybody has heard about this, as you know we try not to go to the component of the guidance. But we do make an estimate of what we think is likely to be and that includes some trends are just external, we don't control. So for example frequency would be one of those. We can't control whether people getting accidents or not. There are some which are partially controllable. And Glenn talked about asset severity and in physical damage or bodily injury; you can control some of that. Some of its inflation is done with the cost of parts where you can try to do a good job making sure your customers get the right amount, not too little much, not too much. And then there are trends we create like price increases and expenses that both Glenn and Steve talked about. So when we're looking at the underlying combined ratio guidance, we look at the trends. We don't know, we can't control, we look at the ones we think we can have some influence on and then the ones we do have influence on. And then we -- as a result of that set our guidance at 86 to 88. It's obvious, of course, that's just a small part of the value created as mentioned doesn't include catastrophe losses.  It doesn't include prior reserve changes, it doesn't include things like pension settlement charges, which I think led to some confusion in the third quarter, doesn't include investment income, doesn't include our life businesses make almost $300 million a year. That does include Allstate benefit. So as it relates to doing projection, the business we think it's useful -- is a way to help you understand how we feel a large component of our business is operating. But I always try to caution us against thinking that is the only value creator and the only thing under which shareholders should decide is whether this is a good story or not. And the next -- it was there anything specifically on frequency in the fourth quarter that we can answer for you? Mike Zaremski : No. I guess it just the answer was there's not really a conclusive long- term trend line to frequency, if you think I understood your answer. Tom Wilson : I think it bounces around a lot Mike, -- what you do want to do and what we try to do is just be flexible, quick and adapt to it. So if it goes up you've got to raise prices. If it goes down, you have to make sure it goes down and then maybe you don't raise prices much and you get a little bit of retention and you've seen both of those stories in the last four years. Mike Zaremski : Okay, great and my follow up are regarding telematics. Thanks for the information and you gave out one stat earlier on the call saying telematics Drivewise policies I think grew 30% year-on-year. Can you give us maybe some more stats or color on what the adoption rate is for telematics? And maybe how we can try to start thinking about the adoption curve longer term? How are you guys going to get these policies into the hands of your policy holders? Tom Wilson : When Glenn gave it a number of 30% of the Allstate brand, the Esurance brand was up substantially more than 30%. They really got focused on it this year. We're finding the adoption rate to be relatively high in going up but you have to manage it. So you have to manage the initial conversation. You have to manage the onboarding and you have to manage not just the conversion rate but the retention rate, so you also have to manage the ongoing relationship. So we focus on all of those components. We've made progress on all those components in 2018. We don't give the specific numbers out because that's just too competitive and everybody else does it. As it relates to where it can go, I think most insurers are going to include telematics, most auto insurers include telematics' pricing, and it's just way too powerful.  It's every bit as powerful as credit was when that was adapted. So the industry is going to adapt it. We made that call when we decided to build areas of platform that we thought it just -- it's too powerful rating factor and if you go back, just the location, so if you price your auto insurance by where somebody is car's garaged, people figure that out. So they garage at one place and drive it someplace else, because it's cheaper. So not everybody does that but it leads to small inefficiencies in the market and to the extent you can be more efficient than when, where and how they drive, it can give you much better pricing.  So it's going to happen. It's hard to tell what the adoption rate will be. But I think you could look at credit as an example and see how that rolled out in the industry over a period of time and basically almost everybody using some form of credit or some proxy for that today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Your question please? Amit Kumar : Thanks and good morning. I wanted to go back to your example upon auto parts in response to Elyse's question. I think not a day passes that we see new headlines on auto tariffs and tariffs on auto parts and seems like we're getting closer to some sort of conclusions. Have your conversations internally on par with the repair shops changed and how are you thinking about in case we do see some action on that? Tom Wilson : I'm sorry I missed the action on what? What was that I missed? Amit Kumar : On the auto tariff discussion you had. Tom Wilson : I'll let Glenn talk about what he's doing specifically inside the business. Obviously, tariffs on steel and to the extent parts are made of steel, becomes expensive. And that's relative to the pricing it's obviously indirect. And in terms of the cost to repair bodies -- I think it's time to actually have a conversation about the cost repair versus the cost to buy a car. And if the auto manufacturers are giving away the razor to sell the blades as a way to make profit and it shows up for individual consumers as higher insurance prices which they don't really understand because it's embedded in the fact that Glenn's example that the headlight now costs $1,900 instead of $300, my first car costs less than the $300 and certainly, I'd go and get a better one for $1,900. So I think that's an economic trend between industries that we need to sort out. And Glenn, anything you want to say about the specific parts and body shops? Glenn Shapiro : Yes, we work -- there's a lot of different approaches we take in our claims team does really great job working on agreed pricing with large auto body shop aggregators and there's a number of components that how they're trying to manage overall costs. Specific to the tariffs, it's something we're keeping an eye on similar to other things we look at from an inflationary standpoint. Like we look at the cost of petroleum because a lot of auto parts and certainly roofing materials and homeowner's petroleum based and we look at price of steel to Tom's point, the tariffs would be another inflationary factor we look at because about 60% of auto glass for example comes from China. And you have a significant percentage of metallic auto parts coming from China as well. So as those work through the system, that's essentially an element inflation that we watch. Amit Kumar : Got it. That's helpful. The only other question I have is just going back I guess to the discussion on pricing, if you look at Slide -- Page 22 of the stat supplement, it says 25 numbers of locations, the Allstate brand change was only 0.3% for Q4. How should we think about broadly the trajectory of rates from here into 2019 in terms of planned rate actions? Thanks. Glenn Shapiro : Yes, this is Glenn. I'll take that on that. We look at, first of all, I think setting context on it, and we had the same underlying combined ratio two years in a row. We look at our margins and we manage for an attractive return. And I think we've shown that where we went after pricing, when we had to with the frequency spike a few years ago and we showed in the fourth quarter on homeowners where we saw some trends there and had to block the pricing. So on a state-by-state and market-by-market basis, we're going to look at the pricing and keep in mind our competitiveness, our need for rate and act accordingly with it. Where you saw the last couple of quarters with very low rate is we had taken a lot of rate a little bit ahead of the rest of the industry, following that frequency spike. And we were more rates adequate in more places. So it was reflected in good stable rate environment for our customers who help with the retention, helps with the growth. But as that turns, we will on a market-by-market basis make those decisions. I can't project forward obviously for you what rate we'll take but I think our history is good evidence of the fact that we'll take the rate necessary to make sure we're managing our margins appropriately. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Kai Pan : Thank you and good morning. My first question follows up on your guidance for 2019. The range 86%- 88% exactly same as a year ago, but the operating environment a little bit different, pricing today is less than a year ago and the loss trend side frequency better today, but a severity it would be worse. So just wondering like, do you built in the same level of conservatives in the initial guidance that could still end up to be like at the lower end or better end of the guidance as we did in 2018? Or this operating environment is totally different? Tom Wilson : Hi, obviously, you're correct in saying that. 2019 is not 2018 and it wasn't the prior 10 years or 11 years how long we've been doing this. And so we look at each year differently. We feel comfortable with 86%, 88%. I would -- there is one word you said that I don't think is accurate which is conservative. We set the range that we think we're going to be in the range. We don't set the range; we think we would be below the range. We pick a number we think is reasonable. This year we revised the range down as you pointed out after the first quarter because frequency was down so much relative to the prior year that we didn't think that we would be in the range anymore. And obviously, we're not -- we were in the middle of the new range. But not where we said beginning of the year. And so that's one of those trends that I mentioned, you just can't forecast. Like that we have no ability to forecast frequency in total, we have our estimates. We look at our trends, Glenn goes by a number of times renewed by --looks at frequently model, make a model, he's going to organize a work on it. But if you said, do we have a solid number that goes into 88, 86 to 88, we make an estimate on that frequency and what we can manage to.  And I think that's the other important part. We think we can manage to 86 to 88, depending on what happens in the marketplace. And we think it's in the right place to be because we're earning incredibly high or we don't -- we have very attractive returns on capital at that level. And so we should be growing the business there. Kai Pan : That's very fair. My second question on SquareTrade. The top line growing for the full year, about 80% year-over-year in terms of region premiums. If you excluding Wal-Mart and to what's underlying growth rate has been for that business and also do you have a sort of long-term view on the profitability of the business, because I just wonder when can these rapid gross meaningful, so top line growth would translate to a matured impact on your Allstate earnings? Tom Wilson : Well, as Mario mentioned, we set three objectives when we did the acquisition things we needed to do and that included the growth you talked about in the domestic retail business. And we've achieved all three of those objectives. Don, can give you some color on growth, the breadth of the growth as growth rate. Don Civgin : Yes. So when you look at the full year, I mean the company obviously has been growing dramatically, part of that has been new customers as you pointed out. The part of it's been just doing a better job with the customers we have. Having them become more able to serve more of their customers. So if you look at the fourth quarter which was obviously a terrific year, there was a large component of the growth in policies that was the result of the large retailer. But even without that, we still would have had a healthy growth number, just because we're growing the existing books that we have as well. As far as the profitability on a long-term basis, you're right. We did set as one of our measure of success, increased profitability and returns on capital. We've been very happy with the improvements we've seen. But we're trying to do it in a balanced way that builds the business for the future. Tom said in his opening comments that Allstate strategy is to grow by protecting people from life's uncertainties where trade is a key component of that because it's not just auto and home. People need to be protected by from -- it's also other things in their lives that are important.  We could probably have made the numbers better. In fact, I know we could have made the numbers better in 2018 by skipping and not investing for the future. But I think, we're seeing the improvement in profitability in a nice balanced long -term sustainable way. Loss rates continue to perform attractively for us. We said earlier that we're going to improve our scale of expenses as we grow the business and the growth has helped us do that. And then we brought our paper in-house. And so we're taking, we're underwriting the risk at all state, which we're obviously capable of doing which helps improve profitability as well. So I'm delighted with the profitability, improvement in profitability. But I think it's the combination of profit and growth working together that's most attractive at this point. Tom Wilson : And Kai, so as Don said, look, we create shareholder value by component. So you are right to ask about the components. We think about it that way but we also look in total. And to the extent we think there is another component we can grow, you can say it hurts a total a little bit. We will do it. So for example SquareTrade had really good growth in European telecom business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Yaron Kinar : Hi, good morning. First question is on industry pricing in auto. Are you surprised to see that rate filings aren't really showing much improvement given the severity turns second half of the year? Tom Wilson : Yaron, I don't know. We don't manage other people's books of business. So we try to just -- we watch what they do. There are some people they run combined ratios higher than we think we need to. We think that the economic rent you can extract in a market relative to value create one that we are very comfortable with. So if we look at our combined ratio whether that be auto or homeowners, we think it's very attractive. There are other people running combined ratios in homeowner insurance which we wouldn't do either and they are growing quite quickly. So we try to manage our own book and look to the -- I don't -- I don't think like these trends that you are seeing in severity will impact other people is our assessment.  I can't say when and how to react to that. Yaron Kinar : Okay. Let me try little differently then. I think heading into 2018 you had said that you saw that your pricing put you now in a competitive advantage and I think that was a little bit of change from the prior few years where you had taken early pricing action. As you look at environment into 2019, how do you think of your pricing relative to the industry in auto? Tom Wilson : Glenn can talk about how is thinking about pricing relative to auto but I want to just take it up a little bit to its both growth and profitability. And doing a better job for our customers. I think what you saw in 2018 in terms of our growth was not just pure price increases but the back add for three or four year we've been working hard on the net promoter score. And the benefits of those improvement got overshadowed by the fact that we did what you describe which was raise prices faster than other people so our retention went down. So if you looking at profitable growth it's both what we priced to which Glenn and I talked about, but also how much for our existing business will retain. Yaron Kinar : Okay. Glenn Shapiro : I'll just add on, as we look at pricing we see competitors as you do in filings. Some are still taking some rates, others aren't. The CPI most recent number which is trailing indicator but was between 5 and 6. And it's come down from much higher than that, and is expected to continue to come down because the filings are different now than they were late 2017 and early 2018 which create that filing change CPI and auto. But the other thing I would look at is, we look at, watch the absolute price change. So we don't start with what the competitive position of particular carrier is. And now we look internally at our competitive position by market and by competitor and so somebody may take a 3% price decrease. But if they are 10% higher than the market and they take, well, they are still higher than the market. So in an absolute level we are looking at our competitiveness on a more granular level than the price changes. Yaron Kinar : Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then one on capital deployment, if I can. I think you deployed well more capital than you generated in earnings. I think that's a multiyear trend that we are seeing. How sustainable is that borrowing a change in asset requirement or capital requirements by the regulators? Tom Wilson : Yaron, the deployment of capital, you are talking about share repurchases in comparison to earnings? Yaron Kinar : I am talking about share repurchases, dividends, M&A, of all the development avenues. Tom Wilson : So first we use preferred stock to restructure some of the balance sheet. I don't think you should assume that what I heard and it might not be what you were implying were you just generating a lot of capital from the business more than you make. That's not the way we think about it. We think about deploying capital except we don't need to deploy capital, or we can get alternative capital that's cheaper than having it from our shareholders. We do that. There could be, we use a bunch of reinsurance, it could be other alternative capital. It could be preferred stock. So we are always seeking to try to optimize the return on our shareholders capital by using other capital.  But we don't have sort of a metric that measures earnings relative to just dividends and share repurchase. So we think about it broader than that. Is that making sense, Yaron? Mario Rizzo : Yes. I mean the only thing I would add is we've been saying for a long time that we -- our capital position is very strong and we continue to generate capital organically. So it's not given -- we start from acquisition, trying to make individual decisions around acquisitions and buybacks. There is no formula of approaching but we still feel very good about where capital position is even after $2.8 billion that we took in our position. Tom Wilson : Jonathan, we will take one more question. Operator : Certainly. Then our final question for the day comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Your question please. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. Just a couple. It's interesting that in the past the homeowners haven't been so [Indiscernible] on an underlying basis but this year it actually was a pretty big headwind. Just curious when you think about your guidance for next year, what type of directionally what you contemplate for margins in home? Tom Wilson : We absolutely, Ryan, we don't like to give some underlying combined ratios for the different component. But let me just maybe make a comment about the pretty big headwind. The underlying combined ratio for homeowners which is in the low 60s because there is such large amount of catastrophe that accompany that business. And as Glenn said, we manage it into total. We give you the underlying combined ratio because we can't estimate to the answers. And, yes, the underlying combined ratio was up some in 2018 versus the prior year. It still though, we are still earnings 93 combined, 893 combined ratio maybe 479 also.  I don't know that we thought of it as a headwind. Are we taking attention to it? Yes. And Glenn can talk about the underlying combined ratio, some comments -- Glenn Shapiro : Yes. So we took it seriously. We talked about it last quarter that we were seeing more non CAT weather. And we had to look at that as we always do by market. We looked at pricing. And so you saw us react with some pricing at 1.1 in the quarter and then you annualize that. That's meaningful move on pricing. And then on top of that, that's rate we get an inflationary factor so the premium is a larger number than what you see in rate.  We can't predict to much like and talk about frequency. We can't predict whether we are going to have another significant non-CAT weather year. We know that, we look at trends, our actual results whether you look at five year, 10 years, 15 years. The one year trend looks worse than the five which looks worse than the 10 generally. So if weather patterns are getting worse and here to stay then we are prepared to react to that with the right pricing. Ryan Tunis : Got you. And then on the auto side, was there a current actually true up at all there, that's slung a loss ratio one way or another on Allstate brand? Tom Wilson : Credit or -- are you talking about prior reserve basis-- Ryan Tunis : What was like current year like, reserve release or change in the loss pack in the fourth quarter? Tom Wilson : Well, we of course change so why don't we have John take it to that because here I would say one we think the numbers are accurately reflect what we earned in 2018. We make changes in reserve picks for the specific year in which we are operating as we go through the year. Sometimes if you make them in October or you should have made them in June then you got a little bit of catch up and I think that's what you were referring to. But it's not a significant element as it relates to the Allstate brands. Some of the smaller brands can have a little bigger quarterly swing because of those true ups but they are also brand usually big enough or it doesn't make much of a difference. So but and John can help you to sort of any additional details.  So thank you for being on the call Allstate strategy. It's obviously to protect people from life's uncertainty. We will continue to reward shareholders by -- decide to be part of our story which is by innovating growing market share and earning attractive return. So thank you all for being on the call. Talk to you next quarter.  End of Q& A Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation at today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I would like to introduce your host for today's program, John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. John Griek : Thank you Jonathan. Good morning and welcome everyone to Allstate's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted today's presentation along with our reinsurance update on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. And Jess Merten, our Chief Risk Officer, has joined us today to discuss how we evaluate risk and return decisions and use economic capital to allocate resources and establish performance targets. As noted on the first slide of this presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements. So please refer to our 10-K for 2018 and other public documents for information on potential risks. Now, I will turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Well, good morning. Thank you for joining us to stay current on Allstate. Let's begin on slide two, with Allstate's strategy to profitably grow market share and protection products. Starting with the upper oval, the personal Property-Liability market has four consumer segments and provides protection by ensuring automobiles, homes and other property. We have four brand. Differentiated products, sophisticated analytics, telematics and are building an integrated digital enterprise to grow market share in this protection space. Our strategy also includes expanding by protecting people from a range of other uncertainties such as shown in the bottom oval, by leveraging our brands, customer base, investment expertise, distribution, claims capabilities and capital. Collectively, these businesses on the bottom oval have tremendous value, which often gets overlooked by investors who focus only on the Property-Liability businesses or on earnings per share. Our strategy creates shareholder value through customer satisfaction, unit growth and attractive returns on capital. It also ensures we have sustainable profitability and a diversified business platform. Moving to slide three. This strategy is driving growth and attractive returns. Policies in force increased for the Allstate and Esurance brands, Property-Liability businesses. SquareTrade had outstanding growth. Total policies in force now exceed $123 million. The Property-Liability underlying combined ratio was 84.2% in the first quarter. Total return on the investment portfolio was strong at 4.7% for the last 12 months but reported income declined this quarter due to lower valuations and limited partnership portfolio. Net income was $1.26 billion, as you can see from the chart on the bottom, reflecting strong operating results and significant capital gains under the accounting policy where equity valuations are reflected in net income. Adjusted net income was $776 million or $2.30 per diluted share in the first quarter. Adjusted net income return on equity was 13.5%, which is a broader measure of how we do from an overall return standpoint than just the underlying combined ratio. Let's turn to slide four. We had a good start on 2019's operating priorities. The first three priorities, better serve customers, achieve target economic returns on capital and grow the customer base, are intertwined to ensure profitable long-term growth. Customers were better served as the enterprise net promoter score improved and customer retention increased across our three underwriting brands. Returns remained strong, both in total and for our individual businesses, as Jess will discuss. The Allstate and Esurance brands grew policies in force by 2.3% and 10.9% respectively, which resulted in the Property-Liability policies increasing by $833,000 compared to the prior year quarter. When you combine that then with the significant growth at SquareTrade, total policies in force now exceed $123 million. The $84 billion investment portfolio total return was 4.7% for the last 12 months. Net investment income for the quarter was adversely affected by lower performance-based results reflecting lower private equity asset valuations. The performance-based portfolio did generate $57 million of capital gains this quarter. We continue to make progress building long-term growth platforms, expanding our relationship with a transportation network to 15 states. We are growing telematics usage and SquareTrade is adding capabilities and expanding markets, while achieving its acquisition goals. Mario will now go through the segment results in more detail. Mario Rizzo : Thanks Tom. Moving to slide five. You can see that Property-Liability results remained strong. Net written premium increased 6.2% in the first quarter, due to policy growth in the Allstate and Esurance brands and a higher average premium across all three underwritten brands. As you can see in the bottom left table, total policies in force increased to $33.4 million or 2.6%. The Property-Liability reported combined ratio of 91.8% was 4.3 points higher than the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio which excludes catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates was 84.2% for the first quarter of 2019. In the quarter, we changed to a fair value based accounting method for pension and other post retirement benefits. This change benefited the underlying combined ratio by approximately 0.2 points in the first quarter relative to the prior method. Our full year outlook for the underlying combined ratio in 2019 was established at the beginning of the year at 86% to 88%, but we do not adjust the range based on one quarter of results. Moving to the right hand table. Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance net written premiums decreased by 4.7% and 6.8% respectively due to policy growth and higher average premiums. Higher average premiums reflect rate changes of over 3.7% in homeowners and 1.4% in auto insurance over the last 12 months. Esurance's auto insurance rate changes were 2.3% over the last 12 months, which combined with policy growth, grew total net written premium growth of 13.4%. Encompass written premiums are essentially flat as higher rates were offset by lower policies in force. On the bottom of the table, you can see the underlying combined ratios were all good in the quarter. Moving to slide six. Our services businesses are growing rapidly and creating shareholder value. SquareTrade revenues increased 34% to $164 million in the first quarter of 2019 driven by significant growth in policies in force. Adjusted net income was $11 million, an increase [indiscernible] from the prior year quarter due to $14 million of profits at SquareTrade as you can see on the right. Arity continued to invest in advancing our telematics platform and had a small loss. Total mileage analyzed is now about 10 billion miles per month and 350% trips per se. Allstate roadside services revenue was $73 million for the quarter with an adjusted net loss of $6 million comparable to the prior year quarter, Allstate dealer services revenue was $107 million in the first quarter. Adjusted net income was $6 million, benefiting from improved loss experience. InfoArmor, which was acquired in October 2018, had revenues of $24 million with over 1.2 million policies in force. The adjusted net loss of $1 million was due to costs associated with the scaling of platform for growth and integration into Allstate. We also acquired iCracked in February which will expand SquareTrade's protection offerings. Turning to slide seven, let's review Allstate life, benefits and annuities. Allstate life, shown on the left, generated adjusted net income of $73 million in the first quarter, up 2.8% from the prior year quarter as higher premiums and investment income more than offset decreased contract benefits and expense. Allstate benefits adjusted net income, shown in the middle chart, was $31 million in the first quarter. The $2 million increase from the prior year quarter was primarily driven by lower contract benefits. Allstate annuities, on the right, had an adjusted net loss of $25 million in the quarter due to lower performance lower performance-based investment income. While the utilization of performance-based investments improved long term economic returns, it increases income volatility for the annuities segment. Let's move to slide eight and discuss our investment results. We proactively manage the investment portfolio considering relevant market conditions, the nature of our liabilities and corporate risk appetite. Our investment portfolio generated a strong 4.7% total return over the last 12 months, of which 3.3% was in the first quarter. The components of return are shown in the chart on the left. The blue bar represents net investment income, which is included in adjusted net income and varies between 80 and 110 basis points per quarter. Approximately 75% of this is from interest income on fixed income investments, which make up 69% of the portfolio. The change in the value of bond portfolio and equity investment obviously varies by quarter, which is why we discuss total return over a 12-month period. Valuation changes in the quarter benefited from declines in risk free rates, tighter credit spreads and a strong rebound of public equity margins. The chart on the right shows net investment income for the first quarter was $648 million, $138 million lower than the first quarter of 2018. Market-based investment income increased to $693 million from $652 million reflecting a modest duration extension for the Property-Liability fixed income portfolio, partially offset by a reduced allocation to high yield bonds. The performance-based portfolio generated investment income of $6 million in the first quarter, lower than the prior year and recent trend reflecting lower private equity asset valuations. The performance-based portfolio did generate $57 million of capital gains as the ownership structure of certain investments requires we record capital gain rather than investment income. Slide nine provides an overview of returns and capital. Our capital position remains strong and we paid $158 million in common shareholder dividends in the first quarter of 2019. As reminder, the Board of Directors approved an 8.7% increase in the quarterly dividend per common share to $0.50, which was paid on April 1 and is not included in the amount returned in the first quarter. Common shares are being purchased with $1 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement, which began in December 2018 and will be completed this week. Upon completion of this agreement, we will have about $1.9 billion remaining on our $3 billion share repurchase authorization. Total shares outstanding at the end of the first quarter were 6% below the prior year. So each shareholder owns 6% more of the company. We continue to generate attractive returns on capital with adjusted net income return on equity of 13.5% for the 12 months ended March 31, 2019. And now Jess will provide an overview of how we economically evaluate risk and return. Jess Merten : Thank you Mario. Let's turn on slide 10 which shows how Allstate uses sophisticated analytics and economic valuation to allocate capital and establish performance goals. Our approach to capital allocation considers multiple perspectives while allowing us to focus on optimizing returns per unit of risk. This begins with establishing economic capital requirements for individual risk by products such as auto, home or life insurance, investment risk such as interest rates or equity valuations by business and for the entire corporation. Capital requirements are based on cash flow projections and probabilistic models, especially for extreme events like catastrophes and incorporate expectations from regulators and rating agencies. This approach allows us to evaluate risk at a granular level to enable us to optimize economic results. Our diversified portfolio of businesses results in a capital benefit that we also incorporate into our strategic capital allocation process. We retain the benefit of risk forbearance between market facing businesses at the corporate level so that each business runs an appropriate standalone return. As a result of these processes, Allstate's capital position is strong and performance exceeds return thresholds. About three-fourth of capital is utilized by the Property-Liability business. All major businesses earned return above the cost of capital other than annuities. We dynamically allocate capital based on risk and return characteristics to establish performance targets. I will start with two examples, Esurance and homeowners insurance to show the benefits of this approach. Let me walk through these point in more detail. Slide 11 provides an overview of our process for determining economic capital. Economic capital is the amount of capital needed to accept risks given expected returns and the range of possible outcomes. This is determined using a sophisticated framework built on our experience and data related to individual risks. In the middle of the slide, you can see the four step process to determine economic capital. Step one is to identify unique risk and return equity for different types of standalone risks. You start with hundreds of individual risks that are grouped into 35 standalone risk types. Examples include auto insurance underwriting risk or interest rate risk. From there we determine required capital for each lines of business by aligning asset and liability risk and estimated correlation to key risks. For example, in establishing capital for auto insurance, accident frequency is uncorrelated with investment risk associated with reserves. So this includes the economic capital. In step three, we aggregate the risk by product and lines of business that comprise of each market-facing operation such as Allstate brand's personal lines Esurance or Allstate auto. The programs between risk types is retained by the market-facing businesses, so required capital [indiscernible] integrated risk profile. The final step, which is [indiscernible] risk group in step three is to quantify the capital required for the entire corporation with a diversified portfolio of risk. This four step process results in overall economic capital being less in each market-facing business as diversification between non-correlated risk lowers Allstate's overall risk level. This program is retained by the corporation so that each business must earn an appropriate return for its risk profile. In setting the value of the capital target, we also consider regulatory and rating agency guidelines and overall financial flexibility. Turning to slide 12. Required capital by line is shown on the upper left quadrant. Approximately one-third of the economic capital is used by auto insurance. About 40% is needed for homeowners insurance which is heavily influenced by catastrophe exposure. These economic capital, industry performance and strategic intent sets out the performance target for our business. Actual results are then used to evaluate performance from a growth and returns perspective as shown on the upper right. First, you can see all major market-facing businesses are earning returns above our cost of capital on a standalone basis except Annuities. The highest return business is Allstate brand auto insurance. SquareTrade has higher returns and growth, but because of it's relative size and modest risk profile, it generates less absolute income than Allstate businesses. Moving to the bottom of the page. Esurance provides a good example of how we use this to evaluate performance in comparison to reported results. Esurance has a combined ratio over 100 but generates a return on capital above our targets. As a result, we invested aggressively in growth. On the lower left, you can see Esurance's combined ratio has [indiscernible]. A large part of the combined ratio however is advertising which is immediately expensed that generates policy which makes million for years. When we acquired Esurance in 2011, we decided to invest aggressively in advertising, which has totaled about $1.3 billion and all have been expensed immediately. This has worked as Esurance now has $2 billion of premium and is in more than twice its original size. To ensure this is economic, we established performance targets for each [indiscernible]. The combined ratios start out high, as you can see on the lower right chart to reflect both the new business policy and the significant advertising cost. The combined ratio of each business year however then declines dramatically since there are no advertising expenses and pricing changes were implemented. This combined ratio is lower and this generates cash which then combined with investment income results in return theme above our targets [indiscernible]. Slide 13 shows homeowners insurance as an example of how economic capital supports the process to establish performance goal within market-facing businesses. As with on the previous slide, over half of the required capital for homeowners was due to catastrophe exposure. We allocate this by state, as shown in the upper left side pie chart. Texas, shown in blue, has significantly slowed due to hurricanes, hailstorms and tornadoes. So the homeowners business must generate returns on the capital needed for these risks. New York, shown in dark red, also had substantial risk, potential risk of hurricane while the probability of loss is low in intensity, the concentration of high value homes on Long Island and Allstate' significant market share results in a large absolute amount of capital required to cover this risk. Notably Florida, shown in orange on the lower right of this chart, is small in absolute dollars because of our extensive use of reinsurance and market share that is below 2%. We use this analysis to establish combined ratio targets which vary by states and as you can see from the top right chart, targets differ between high capital and lower capital states. Our top five states utilized 45% of Allstate brand homeowners insurance economic capital, with an average combined ratio target of 83%. This compares to the remaining 45 states which utilize 55% of economic capital at an average combined ratio target of 88%. This approach ensures we achieve strong aggregate returns with the economic hurdles that reflects the underlying risk of each states. The adjusted target of the cash to the exposures change and in total, this has declined over the last decade, which we can see from the bottom left chart. In establishing targets, we also compare ourselves to our competitors in wanting to have a competitive price and better performance. As shown on the chart at the bottom right, we have a better combined ratio than Progressive, Liberty Mutual and State Farm while being competitively priced for the value we deliver and earn attractive returns. These sophisticated capital allocation capabilities are well woven in our strategy, while generating attractive risk adjusted returns on capital. Now, we will open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your question, please. Jay Gelb : Thanks very much. On personal auto, in particularly the Allstate brand, we are hearing a little bit more about increased competition on rates. I was wondering, if you could touch base on that in terms of what you are seeing from a competitive standpoint and also how Allstate is addressing that issue too? Thanks. Glenn Shapiro : Hi Jay. Thank you. This is Glenn. Yes. We are seeing definitely competition out there. If you look at the CPI a year ago, it was at 9%. Now it's in the twos. That said, we like our competitive position. It's something we monitor in each state on an ongoing basis about how we are doing both competitively and from a return standpoint. Our new business is up. Our retention is up. And I think the most encouraging sign is that the system is helping in that, we have got about 3,000 more people in that system selling our product than we did a year ago. That means agents are investing and hiring more sales people and they are smart, small business owners and they only do that when they feel like they can compete. So it's a competitive market out there. I know you have heard that from others in the market and you can see the rates are getting filed, but we like our position and our ability to grow. Jay Gelb : I appreciate that. And then, within the Allstate brand, on the so-called commercial lines business, can you talk a little bit about exactly what that is and what's driving the fast growth? Steven Shebik : So Jay, this is Steve. So at commercial lines, we generally focus on smaller businesses. That's been our historic business for a long time. So a lot of our policyholders also own businesses. We are out in the marketplace within 10,000 communities in the United States. I would say most communities. So we have a presence. And we want to ensure not only autos and homes, but other things in their lives, as Tom noted at the beginning in terms of broadening of protection. If you remember, back last March, so March of 2018, we signed an agreement with Uber to insure some of their drivers. So we had three states originally. Then we added a fourth in June. And just March, we initially added 11 more states. So the growth you have seen over the last year-and-a-half, about a year in the quarter, is really based on that Uber relationship. Jay Gelb : I see. Can you characterize the -- you would generally characterize the profitability of that line? Steven Shebik : If you look at our balance, we say it's early for us to really analyze how we are doing in that. We are recording at our priced loss ratios. We feel we are pretty good with those. But the history is not really there. More than half of the potential claims from the T&C's would be in liability coverages. So it's longer tail on those. And as you know, these businesses have not been in business for more than a handful of years of any size. And so as we see the market changing and those companies growing rapidly, you need to be careful and conservative in your reserving and pricing. Mario Rizzo : So, Jay and let me provide a little perspective. So when we first set up the relationship with Uber, of course, they were doing a bunch of this themselves and they are using some other people. We had access to all that data. One of the reasons we are a value to them as a partner is our claims capabilities. And so we can look in quite fair amount of detail at how to handle those bodily injury claims. So we are confident that we are in a good place. Jay Gelb : I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please? Greg Peters : Good morning. My first question. I guess I am going to focus on the last piece of your presentation around capital allocation. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the balance between maximizing ROEs and investing in the business? In your chart, specifically the one on the upper right hand corner of page 12 where you identify Arity, the annuities business and roadside services as running below your cost of capital hurdles. And I suppose this is in the context of the published reports of the possibility of the sale of your annuity business. Tom Wilson : Okay. Let me take it and then, Jess, if you want to jump on the annuity piece. So first, Greg, we run the business for the long term. We try not to run it for quarterly earnings. So in 2011, in the bottom of the crisis for us, we were still investing heavily in advertising. So we always try to look long-term at whatever we are investing in. It doesn't mean we keep throwing money, good money after bad. We do watch our expenses quite closely. So we tried to take a longer term view of that. That also applies to annuities and it applies to Arity. Let me do Arity first then annuity second. So Arity, one of the things Jess said is that's a standalone number. And so Arity, but if you look at Arity in terms of the whole company, the amount of value it's creating for us in our insurance businesses in terms of better pricing, it's a net win for us. So we evaluate them independently but then we look collectively at how they work with our company. The same thing is true with annuities. So at annuities, we have talked about multiple times, right. Annuities are not a good business for us from a return standpoint on two basis. One is economically and two is in the financial book. If you look at the economic piece of that, that's because these are long-dated liabilities. Long-dated liabilities like the pension fund should be mostly invested in equities and the regulatory capital requirement for investing in equities is quite high. So you should be investing equities but when you put all that money in equity, but it doesn't bring your current return down even though on a long-term basis, it's absolutely the right thing to do. We chose to do that anyway. And what we do is, we allocate a portion of that corporate co-variance in our own model. We can still manage overall corporate results, but we just allocate a portion of that corporate co-variance which is obviously a capital reduction to that business. Financially, it's also not a good return business for us and that's because the way the reserving has been done and required for years has been, when you set up the reserves, initially you don't change it. And there's a few odd cases that work, but generally you don't change, when people live longer, because these are the payout annuities, you don't change your reserves and when interest rates go down, you don't change in reserves. And so as a result of that there is a liability that is bigger, if you look at it from an economic standpoint. We factor that into adjusted numbers just has it all factored into how we look at the company. It just doesn't show up on the financial book. So there is some new accounting things coming out, which Eric talked about both in the K in the Q that will change their accounting. And what that changed accounting will do is basically take those losses that have been incurred economically in the past that we factored into our analysis into the balance sheet. And well, that will be a material change to the balance sheet. So we always though managed long term, think economically, cash flow is what drives us, but we are cognizant of what's going on in the financial results and try to help you see when those numbers are at odd. Is that helpful? Greg Peters : Yes, it is. Just a point on and I have a second question, but a point on your annuity comment. The material charge or the material event as it relates to annuities, that's expected to happen in the fourth quarter 2020 or 2021? Tom Wilson : It's required to be adopted in 2021. But as like always the case in these things, you can choose to do it once you figure it out. But it's complicated. Greg Peters : Okay. My second question and thank you for that answer. My second question, switching gears to homeowners. The Allstate brand homeowners underlying combined ratio still feels like it's running a little bit higher or a little bit above target and the Encompass homeowners underlying combined ratio is even higher than that. And I am just curious about your perspective about the homeowners business. Do you feel like that's a market where there's more rate in the pipeline? Are you satisfied with the returns and the growth profile? Tom Wilson : Let me start up top and then Glenn and Steve might want to make some comments for Allstate brand and then Encompass. So first, we love the homeowners business. We get really good returns in it and we help customers because it is something that with these level of catastrophes is really important today. And so when you look at the, you are talking about the underlying combined ratio, I think, four or five years ago we started talking about it should be in the low-60s. I think it's about 63 right now. That doesn't factor in the fact that the catastrophe losses have come down over that period of time as well. So we don't talk to it. We don't share our specific targets by line, by state with people and probably because it is just too complicated a conversation to have over time. But we feel really good about our overall returns in homeowners. I do think that the Encompass returns are not as good as they need to be. And Steve will talk about what he is going to do that. That said, we manage our business at a granular level and everybody doesn't get an A on every test. We don't, like, throw them out of the class, right. So some states are good. And then we have to work to get them back. Some brands are not as good on something and we work to get them back in place. And Glenn can talk about what he's doing in profitability in the first and the Allstate brand because again we don't sit still on edge even though we have good returns. We have work to do. And Steve can talk about Encompass. Steven Shebik : All right. Yes. So I always say, the first number I look at just for context, I look at the recorded combined and then the underlying because if you really think about this business, we are accountable to manage the catastrophe risk too. So over the long period of time, you really want to produce an underwriting profit. And over the last seven years, I think there's only been one quarter that we didn't produce an underwriting profit. So it's been a good stable business. To building on Tom's point, we like homeowner and we like the return we are getting overall with homeowner, the 92 in the quarter. But your question is right in that the underlying has ticked up over time, particularly look at the last five quarters or so. And last quarter I said to you that we had last year a very wet year. A lot of non-cat weather. So more rain, less hail was my line. I think I regret that line now. Actually, a lot hail in the first quarter. And so you look at the weather patterns and it is something we have to respond to. We did take a couple of points of rate in the first quarter. And the other thing I would point you to is, we do have an inflationary factor built into home. So sometimes we are not only focused on a filed rate and if you look at the trailing 12-months, it's 3.2. But the average premium is up 4.5 because of the inflationary factor. So if you take that 2.1 in the first quarter and about three points in the last two quarters and look at inflationary factors on there too, we are responding and reacting to new weather patterns. Glenn Shapiro : So when you look at Encompass, Tom said it very well. We believe we need to take some actions in order to raise the returns and lower the combined ratio we have in the business. We do have a little bit different footprint than what the Allstate brand has and we are more concentrated. Obviously, it's a much smaller book of business. There are areas where we point agents and they have had a lot of business. We don't have the same broad footprint that the Allstate brand has. So that leaves in places where we have switched certain concentrations in areas that sometimes they have significant catastrophe exposures and sometimes we have no exposure in areas. So California wildfires, we had areas where we had significant losses. You may have seen a year before last. In other areas we had none. So the things we are working on to improve the business, there are a number of states we need to have significant rate increases. And we are working hard to achieve those to get those particular locations up to our cost of capital and above. Secondly, we are looking at our footprint. I am trying to reduce that concentration. So in some areas, we are appointing agents away from the areas we are. In other, we are trying to constrain business through underwriting in areas where we are too highly concentrated. And lastly, we are working on our processes, claims, pricing sophistication so we can create a bit closer and better for the risk that we have. So we hope over time that we will get a very similar result as Allstate brand has. That's out goal. Greg Peters : Thank you for your answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Thanks. My first question, I am going back to the auto environment a little bit more. Your new business growth, which you did highlight in response to an earlier question, did slow year-over-year this quarter. I know it obviously last year was a pretty good new business growth here for your auto book. Was that expected? Or are you seeing kind of any change out there as some other peers are also now taking less rate and also looking to grow? Tom Wilson : Thanks Elyse. Yes, there's no question that, as I mentioned before, that the CPI is down and for context, when you look at the CPI at about 2.4 in the first quarter, that's a trailing 12-months basically because it's the rate that as people open their build that month, what kind of surprises they are getting. And obviously this year, at 2.4% increase on average versus a 9% the prior year does create less shoppers. That said, I think you put it in your question well that this is an increase over what was a high base. We had a strong year last year and a strong first quarter last year on new business and we are increasing over that in that sort of the health of the system overall. Jess Merten : Elyse, I would add and Glenn said this earlier, we are also focused on retention. So our retention was up half a point. That's half a point of growth and that's half a point of growth of new business penalty associated with it. So one of the things we obviously want to focus on, one of the reasons are one of our operating priorities, better serve our customers is because it is good for them and good for us. So the other part is, I think a lot of people focus on this. The percentage changes that are out there, that is important. The other part is, what's your absolute price. So while some people have reduced their price recently, we still think we have a highly competitive price relative to them. So they are just coming down closer to where we are as opposed to taking us out of the market. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question, you guys filed, you provided your updated catastrophe reinsurance program last night as well. It seems like your nationwide cover you have, the tower goes a little bit higher compared to where it was last year, greater cat bond usage in the program and it seems like your cost only modestly went up. I wasn't sure if you could just talk to us a little bit about placing the cover and what you saw in terms of the market and the price there? And then as you think of placing in the Florida portion of your coverage, is there anything that would indicate that maybe what you are seeing in the pricing there would be different than when you placed that nationwide cover? Mario Rizzo : This is Mario. I will answer your question on reinsurance. So I will take you back to what Jess talked about in the presentation around how we think about risk return on capital. As reinsurance is one of the ways that we kind of optimize the risk and return profile of our homeowners business and we use reinsurance extensively. And we posted the details around our national excess of loss cat program yesterday and we did increase the top of our tower a bit. So we bought coverage up to $4.86 billion after a $500 million retention on a per event cover. In addition to that, we repeated in the catastrophe bond market what we started last year, which was, we replaced a cat bond that provides both excessive loss cover as well as serves as an aggregate. So we now have roughly $800 million of aggregate protection in excess of $3.54 billion. So we have both an excess of loss program as well as an aggregate program through two catastrophe bonds. I think from a pricing standpoint, your comment was spot on. We did see some modest pressure on pricing. I think a lot of that was driven by reinsurers kind of reevaluating their wildfire exposure in their models. But it was not a material move from a pricing standpoint. So we feel really good about the placement this year. And then just to remind you, we effectively renew a third of our program every year which further insulates us from any real fluctuations in reinsurance pricing year-to-year. So we feel good about the execution and we use both the traditional reinsurance market and the ILS market to have optimized the execution of our placements. So overall, we feel good about the program. With Florida, obviously, there have been a lot of a stories around the upward development on some of the hurricane losses. Our recoveries over the last couple of years have been a bit more modest, I think, than others. So we will see what the ultimate pricing is, but I wouldn't expect a meaningful variation relative to what we saw in the national program. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you very much. I appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Your question, please. Amit Kumar : Thanks and good morning. Two quick questions. The first question uses page 21 of your supplement as a backdrop. If you look at the loss cost trends, severity is up 6%, frequency is usually down in the 1% to 3% range. How should we think about, I guess, that trend line versus the written premiums for the next few quarters? Jess Merten : Amit, let me provide an overview of how we establish financials and then Glenn can talk about the specific operations. So we give paid numbers and we have both, we have gross net paid incurred case reserves. We slice and dice our work on what is the right loss cost to put in the financials at some great length. And so we feel comfortable with the reserves. We have established based on the trends that you see in paid and then the other trends we see in the other numbers. Glenn, I know we have talked at some length about on physical damage in auto insurance. I assume that's where you are at. And Glenn can talk about that component. Glenn Shapiro : Yes. So physical damage, as you point out, has been elevated really over the last year and you see things across the industry and we are no exception to it. It's run around 6% and is for the quarter as well versus the longer term trend of around 4%. One thing, I think is important for sort of context in the broader question you have around that relative to margins and to prices is that, that's really sort of one quarter of the overall auto loss trends. Because if you break it out, physical damage coverages and injury coverages, that splits roughly half-and-half. And each of those are impacted equally by frequency and severity, as you point out. It's really when you look at overall loss trends, three out of the four quadrants that I just described are performing at or better than expectations and one is running higher. So the overall loss trend is manageable right now and you could see that in our combined ratio and the fact that rates have been relatively modest. But we are clearly focused on the physical damage and just a little color behind that, I know we talked about it last quarter is, you look at the math and auto manufacturers have definitely increased the pricing of parts. You look at the trajectory and some of this is complexity of cars and some of it is pricing choices because you look at the overall cost of cars and how it's accelerated over 10 years to buy a car in whole and the cost of parts and the two trend lines are wildly different. The cost of parts have gone up dramatically faster than the cost of a car and that's definitely impacting repair costs, which then create more total losses and higher fiscal damage expenses. Amit Kumar : Got it. That's very helpful. The only other question is and this might be an easy answer here. I was looking at the expense ratio for Allstate brand homeowners and auto. And there seems to be some sort of variability in Q1. The Q1 number seem to be down versus Q2, Q3 and Q4. How should I think about that? What exactly is causing that expense ratio to be slightly down in Q1 versus the remaining three quarters? Tom Wilson : Amit, I wouldn't really look at the expense ratio by quarter and draw a trend line from one quarter to next because there's stuff that goes in and out every quarter. We make adjustment, agency bonus and these all kinds of different accruals. So I would note that. Glenn can talk about the work we are doing on expenses, which is in an environment where you are running, let's just take home auto at 90 combined ratio, homeowners at 92 and a regulated environment on price and some even modest cost pressure, you want to maintain your margins as well as you can. So you look at all things you can do to control those margins including expenses. So Glenn might want to talk some about what we are doing at expense management. Glenn Shapiro : Yes. We have been very focused on expenses. As Tom said, when you look at where we are and what levers you can pull and I think the greatest value we can provide customers is to deliver the product with lower expense. So we looked at our supplier management. We have a lot of really good work going on with our procurement. From an operational standpoint, in our claims area, the team has moved materially on their expenses over the last year-plus, they are down 500-plus people in terms of the overall operation and being able to manage in spite of our growth and the frequency trend creating kind of a flat claims reported trend. And we are looking at, as we go forward, we are looking at ways that we can manage expenses more effectively with our agency force as well through things like providing services to our agency force. So expenses are a significant focus for us. Amit Kumar : Got it. Thanks for that clarification and good luck for the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please? Yaron Kinar : Hi. Good morning. So my first question is around the increased use of telematics. So, I think we all intuitively understand that it should also result in some improvement in the loss ratio over time. But can you maybe talk a little bit about whether you see an impact from greater use of telematics on the expense ratio, whether through more efficient claims handling or more efficient customer acquisition? Tom Wilson : Yes. Let me go up a minute and then, Don can talk about some of the things we are doing at telematics. Glenn, may be you can talk about claims. So well, I would rephrase your question a little bit, if you give me the space to say, it's really about integrated digital enterprise. So it's using data, analytics, technology and process redesign to improve our effectiveness and our efficiency. So we have talked at some length about quick photo claims. So six pictures from customers, pay them in hours, not in days, no more 937 drive-throughs, fewer auto adjusters. So there's is a variety of work we are doing around the company to build an integrated digital enterprise. One part of that is telematics. And that's getting information, accumulating information. I don't think that that's reduced our expenses. In fact, we have been investing heavily in telematics for the last nine or 10 years. And each year we invest more because we see it adding more value to our customers. And Don can talk about the overall view of why we are doing telematics and the benefits to our customers and our company. But maybe, Glen do you want to start with IDE and then Don with telematics. Glenn Shapiro : Sure. Yes. So we really think there is a lot of opportunity going forward with telematics as you think about operational improvement. So for one and this is a go forward, this is not in place today but you look at the opportunity to report losses in real time. So eliminating the need for first notice a lot because we have instantaneous notification. And then opportunity is there in the, I will call it, relative near term, is not a far out proposition. And then we are already working with looking at information for liability determination. It's helping us understand what occurs in an accident, which can make you both more efficient and more accurate in what you are doing. But one other piece that I don't think was in the question, but I think it's really important is, we have a materially higher promoter score when people are using telematics. So you think about retention and you think about the interest that people have and the feedback they are getting to become better drivers and just the interesting thing with Allstate, it makes a big difference when we have those signed up with telematics. Don Civgin : Yes. So let me talk a little bit about the early side of it. So we talked last month about the value of telematics and how it can be used in different ways. And I think two conclusions from that. The first is, we firmly believe that it will be the better way to price insurance because we have a better understanding of risk. I think the second thing is the access to that telematics data also allows us to understand driving behavior, which is an important component of adding value back for customers, both our customers and our partners' customers. So we have been investing in Arity. You mentioned the expense side of it. Arity is running at a very small loss at this point. But a large part of that is not just investment in things that we know how to do today, but it's product development as well. So we are investing in things that will create more value in the future for our customers. And that's probably roughly half of the investment we are making on the product side. We have just under 15 million connections with customers today. I think we talked a little bit about how much data we are collecting, how quickly we are analyzing that. We have analyzed roughly 115 billion miles and what that allows us to do is, again, not only price the insurance more accurately but provide value for our customers. So if you look at our relationship with Life360, through that connection we are able not only to give them safe driving tips for their customers, but also get them personalized insurance offers from a variety of different carriers. So it is an investment. It offers lots of opportunities in the future around pricing and the ability to serve customers that will make them safer drivers. Yaron Kinar : Pretty well. Thank you for the comprehensive answer. I guess one other very quick one. Why was the reclassification of the pensions, why did it impact the loss ratio as opposed to the expense ratio? Tom Wilson : Yes. That's the thing about the part of the loss ratio as claim expense, which is related to the people that settle claims for us. So that part of the pension expense goes through the loss ratio. Yaron Kinar : So this pension expense only impacted that claims people as opposed to --? Tom Wilson : No. It gets allocated across both claims and underwriting expense. So the fact that there is people embedded within our claim expense ratio that's where that the loss ratio benefits from that change? Yaron Kinar : Okay. Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. You might have your phone on mute. There we go. Michael Phillips : Hello there? Can you hear me? Operator : We can hear you now. Michael Phillips : Okay. Thank you. So a question kind of stepping back at a high level. So we measure a lot of things. I guess I am curious if you measure foot traffic in and out of your brick and mortar stores that are out throughout the country, so kind of the number of people coming in and out of those stores. And if you do, how has that changed today versus if you look at back maybe 10 years ago? Are more people coming into using that or less? Tom Wilson : This is Tom. I can't give you number 10 years versus today. And I would say, that you have to split that into two components. What do they come in for that they want to come in for? And what do they come in for because you make them come in for it? And so, for example, if you have a bill that's late and you can make somebody come in and drop it off at your office or you can give them a credit card option and then they can call and put it on the credit card, not have to drive anywhere. So in general, our focus is to be there for our customers when they want us to be there for them and to use faster, more digital technologies when they don't want it. I do think what you are saying is the trend over 10 years, a lot more people are comfortable using digital stuff. The capabilities are better. The phones are better. And so we are leaning in heavily to that whereas we used to make people come to our drive-through claim places to get their car looked at. We now have them send us six pictures. So that said, there are plenty of things that people do want to come into the office. But it depends on the office and the type of customers. So we try to be there for them when those people want to be there. So some agencies hold events for their customers. They hold their charity events there or they do planning processes or they go out, they don't go over to the office, but the agency goes to the school and talks about distracted driving. So I would say, in general, our effort though is to try to do as much as we can digitally that the customer wants to do digitally so that it lowers our cost and improves our speed and to the extent they want to do it in person, then we do it in person. Michael Phillips : Okay. Thank you Tom. I will let others get in given the lack of time. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your question, please. Michael Zaremski : Hi. Good morning. Thanks. In regards to the pension accounting changes, can you clarify how that helped underlying combined ratio? And does it change how we should think about the guidance range as well? Tom Wilson : I will let Mario answer how it went through the combined ratio and the guidance. But I would only add just on the guidance. We knew we were making this change when we did the guidance. The reason we made this change really is the trend towards financial reporting is fair value, whether that's your equity portfolio goes up or down in a quarter, goes to net income that used to be unrealized capital gains and didn't go through net income. And so this is just another step along the way going to sort of fair value on the overall result. Now in addition, it was kind of choppy the way it was before with pension settlement charges and this just spreads it out over a longer or spreads it out over time. You don't get these quarterly bumps or settlement charges when people decide they want to retire, which tends to be at the end of a year. So you are kind of dancing around in the fourth quarter is where they have a settlement charges. This just puts it all on fair value, puts us all on the same basis. Mario, do you want to talk about the combined ratio? Mario Rizzo : Yes. Maybe I will just give you a little bit of color on, really when you think about pension expense I would break it out into two pieces. So the part Tom alluded to the fair value component which is really just the change in the valuation of planned assets and liabilities quarter-to-quarter, that runs through the income statement through net income, but it gets reported below the line. So it doesn't affect adjusted net income. The portion of pension expense that is in adjusted net income is really the period specific pension costs. Things like benefit accruals for that particular period, interest cost, those kinds of things. Those are still in adjusted net income. When you look at the differences, as I mentioned during the presentation, when you look at the difference between kind of the previous method and the current method of pension accounting for the first quarter of 2019 and we provide you a table in the 10-Q that gives you the difference in cost, in whole for the corporation it was worth about $21 million in lower cost in the quarter. Not all of that is Property-Liability, a portion of it is. That's where you get to about the two-tenths of a point impact in the quarter. So I would view that as a reasonably small impact. And to Tom's point, we knew we were going to make the change when we established the guidance. So I don't think it really has an impact on how we think about the outlook for the combined ratio. Michael Zaremski : Okay. That's very helpful. And my last question is regarding slide 13. You show your net PMLs have been reduced a lot over time. And so directionally, should your catastrophe load also be lower than your, let's just say, 13 or 14-year long term historical average? And Tom, I believe you touched on this potentially earlier in your answer about homeowners returns? Tom Wilson : Well, I think, what it does do is, it lowers the amount of capital you carry for catastrophe events. But mathematically the probable maximum loss is really driven by large individual discrete events like, of course for hurricane or some large set of events, which are low probability. That's where you are carrying all that capital for just in case something really bad happens. When you look at the catastrophe load on a quarterly basis and say how many hailstorms do we have? How many freezes do we have? That's really driven more by the weather. And that's factored into, that doesn't reduce capital as much because those things tend to go. So I wouldn't automatically go from lower PML to go to that chart we have in the supplement that shows percentage of premiums on cap and say that should be coming down too because what really drives that is just the weather. Now we do a bunch of things around it to make sure it's less, right. So we have house and home, we do age rate groups. We do a whole bunch of things to manage that number, as Glenn said, because we are accountable for the total combined ratio. But I wouldn't translate lower PML, lower capital therefore lower percentage every quarter. Michael Zaremski : So then if I could follow-up then. So from us looking from the outside in, should we just use your very long-term historical cat load as a guide mirror for making our projections? Thanks. Tom Wilson : Yes. I would look at the long term percentage and just say that cats not predictable. And so I would come back to, on a rolling basis, as Glenn said, we have made money every quarter for seven years, except for one. I think, like in homeowners, you just kind of look at it on a longer-term basis. Just a one-year, three-year basis, you want to run a combined ratio where you are getting a fair amount of spread on it. Some of our competitors run combined ratios substantially higher than us in homeowners. We don't think that's appropriate because of the capital that you have to put up and you don't get a lot of investment income at homeowners. So you should look at us and assume we can have a reported combined ratio that generates an underwriting profit. And just talked showed you what we think those should be and that's by state. Obviously in total, it can be higher than that by state because we have co-variance that's not shown in that chart. So when you see the one that says 88, we could be higher than 88, still get a good return on the whole company, because we have co-variance in it. Glenn Shapiro : And Jonathon, we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please. Josh Shanker : I just want a quick one following up on Amit's question on auto expense severity a little bit. As more cars hit the road with automatic emergency braking and weird gadgets and the side view mirrors and whatnot. Is the upward trend in severity a permanent part of what we are going to see happen on physical damage for the foreseeable future? Glenn Shapiro : Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. This is Glenn. I would say that there is no question, the complexity of cars is getting greater and we have seen the increase in cost to repair than that of cost of parts. Now theoretically, you get two sides of that equation that all of those things you just mentioned should help avoid some accidents. We see some evidence of that in some places. But frankly the broader trend of lower frequency is more driven by the number of miles driven than it is by that. But over time you would expect some frequency benefit as the car park increases the percentage of cars that have loss avoidance capabilities and an increase in the cost to repair those cars. So I do think there is the potential for a long term trend that you would have the cost of the newer cars making up a bigger portion of the overall cost to repair. But it's why I think we need to work with manufacturers and look at the cost of parts, because as I think I said last quarter, the percentage of total losses continues to go up and I don't think it's good for society or the industry as a whole to you have cars become disposable to where if it's in an accident, you throw it out and you get new one. I think there is benefit to be able to come up with more attractive and cost effective ways to repair these cars. Tom Wilson : Okay. Thank you all. So our strategy is to properly grow market share in our protection products, making sure we have good strong results. We had a good strong quarter. We will continue to work on behalf of our shareholders by innovating and growing market share. Thank you very much. Have a great quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I would like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. John Griek : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome everyone to Allstate's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted today's presentation along with our reinsurance update on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and cover a special topic.  Mary Jane Fortin, President of Allstate Financial Businesses will provide an overview of Allstate annuities and how the business has been substantially reduced in size over the last 13 years and how we have managed the remaining liabilities to maximize shareholder value.  The special topic last quarter was about how we match capital to risk at a granular level to ensure we maximized economic returns. Our first special topic at the beginning of this year was how telematics is being utilized in auto insurance and how Arity our telematics business is a leading innovator. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements. So please refer to our 10-K for 2018 and other public documents for information on potential risks. Now, I will turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Well, good morning. Thank you for joining us to stay current on Allstate. Let's begin on Slide 2, Allstate's strategy to protect people from life's uncertainties. The strategic objectives are to grow Personal Property-Liability market share and expand other protection businesses. So we start with the upper oval. The personal Property-Liability market provide consumers protection by ensuring a wide range of assets, automobiles, homes, motorcycles, boats, other personal assets and then their personal liability. We use highly recognized brands, sophisticated pricing, differentiated products, claim expertise and telematics to deliver unique customer value propositions. We're also building an integrated digital enterprise that were lower costs and better serve customers. As shown in the bottom oval, this strategy also includes providing consumers protection plans, life insurance, voluntary workplace benefits and identity protection.  We also have a rapidly growing shared economy commercial insurance business that serves freight sharing companies, and our telematics provider Arity. These businesses are enhanced by leveraging our brands, customer base, investment expertise, distribution, claims capabilities and cap on. It's not just what you see in the oval this real. So for example, we're rebranding SquareTrade products in the United States to fully utilize the Allstate name, which both leverages and expands our reach since these products are sold to major retailers. Our claims capabilities are helping us to implement and grow the commercial insurance business with a ride sharing company. Collectively, the protection businesses in the bottom oval have a tremendous value. It can be overlooked by investors who focus only on the Property-Liability oval. This strategy creates shareholder value, customer satisfaction, unit growth and attractive returns on capital. It also ensures we have sustainable profitability in a diversified business platform.  Moving to Slide 3, we had a strong first half of the year. We made progress in all five of our 2019 operating priorities. Revenues exceeded $11 billion, with Property-Liability premium up almost $0.5 billion over last year's second quarter. The service businesses revenue was up 26.6% to over $400 million for the three months. Net income was $821 million and adjusted net income was $2.18 per share, as you can see on the chart on the bottom.  As a result of this strong performance, we improved the 2019 Property-Liability underlying combined ratio almost by 1.5 points, which is about $500 million of underwriting income better than the original guidance. Adjusted net income return on equity was 13.5% for the last 12 months. Adjusted net income return on equity is a broad measure of our overall performance and that includes investments, Allstate life, benefits, annuity and the service businesses. Since this represents the returns we generate an all capital, it's the best measure for our average. So as a result in 2020, we will establish long-term adjusted net income return on equity targets. Consequently, we will not use the Property-Liability underlying combined ratio to provide annual guidance on operating results, but we will continue to use it in our dialogue on it. We're making this change since we're committed to being a leader in the amount in quality of our financial disclosures to enable user sets our performance and investment potential.  Turning to Slide 4, we made good progress in all five 2019 operating priorities. The first three better serve our customers, achieve target economic returns on capital and grow the customer base our inner trying to ensure profitable long-term growth. Customers were better served as the Enterprise Net Promoter Score improved. As a result of that policy renewals increased in the Allstate and Encompass brands, which is a key driver of growth, although the increases in improvement have slowed.  Returns remain strong which we discussed with all the businesses performing well except one portion of Allstate annuity, which Mary Jane will cover. Total policies in force now are reached 129 million, an increase of 46.8% compared to the prior year. SquareTrade policies grew 84 million reflecting the substantial expansion last August with a large US retailer. Property-Liability policies increased by 772,000 from the prior year to 333.6 million as the Allstate and Esurance brands grew 2.2% and 8.4%, respectively.  Proactive risk and return positioning of the $86 billion investment portfolio resulted in a total returns 7% for the last 12 months and generated $942 million in net investment income for the quarter. Performance based investment income increased significantly from the first quarter of this year. Shareholder value beyond current earnings is being created to increase telematics usage and greater sophistication at Arity. SquareTrade is expanding into Europe and InfoArmor identity protection offerings are being integrated into our strategies.  Glenn will not discuss our Property-Liability results to more detail. Glenn Shapiro : Thanks Tom. Moving to Slide 5, you can see that Property-Liability results remain strong. Net written premiums increased 5.9% in the second quarter for almost $1 billion through the first six months compared to prior quarter. This reflects policy growth in the Allstate and Esurance brands and higher average premium for auto and homeowners insurance claims across all three underwritten brands. As you can see in the middle of the left table, total policies in force increased 2.4% to 33.6 million.  Moving to the bottom of that table, the Property-Liability recorded combined ratio of 95.8 was 1.4 points higher than prior your quarter primarily due to catastrophe losses. This was partially offset by reduction in operating expenses due to a combination of sustainable operational efficiencies achieved through focused efforts on streamlining processes and automation and lower incentive compensation given higher growth targets this year. The underlying combined ratio which excludes catastrophes and priority reserved estimates was 84.3 for the first six months of 2019 below the annual guidance, which assumes higher frequency of auto insurance claims. Auto physical damage severities were higher than expected. However, this was offset by planned reduction and expense ratio. As a result of this performance, we're improving the guidance range by 1.5 points to 84.5 to 86.5 for the full year of 2019. This revised range assumes lower auto claims frequency and higher physical damage severity as well as investments in growth initiatives, the logic of which we'll cover on the next slide.  Moving to the right hand table, Allstate brands auto and homeowners' insurance net written premium increased 5% and 6.5% compared to prior year quarter respectively. Auto policies in force were up 2.5% over the prior year and average premium was up 2.7% compared to the prior year quarter. Homeowners' policies increased by 1.6% and average premiums grew by 5.6% over last year.  Esurance's auto insurance policy growth was 8.1%, which combined with average premium increases resulted in total net written premium growth of 9.6%. Encompass written premium increased 1.1%, a higher average premium more offset the decline in policy in force. On the bottom of the table, you can see the underlying combined ratios remain strong across our brands. And this strong performance means that investment and growth will increase shareholder value.  Turning to Slide 6, investments in profitable growth are focused on Allstate brand Property-Liability insurance. Attracted margins support investment growth for five reasons. First, auto and home insurance generates very attractive returns on capital as you'll see towards the end of our prepared remarks. Allstate has earned and underwriting profit in auto and home insurance for each of the last eight years, reflecting a focus on profitability, operational excellence and timely response to external conditions. Current results are strong with recorded combined ratio of 93.7 in the Allstate brand of the last 12 months. Allstate has operational strengths, including pricing sophistication, branding, and with expanded total sales producers by 11% in the past two years. We also have successfully tested different combinations of growth levers in six markets over last nine months to provide us a roadmap to the best willful execution. This comprehensive program is highly targeted by geography, product and customer segment.  We use a wide variety of tools including advertising, customer experience, initiatives, pricing sophistication, telematics and new agency technology. While we're expanding these initiatives, they won't have a significant impact on 2019 policy in force growth. Unit growth is expected to accelerate in 2020 and 2021. This will slightly increase expenses from the current lower levels and have a small impact on combined ratio. But this is factored into the improved outlook for underlying combined ratio we just discussed. On a longer term basis, we're working to reduce other expenses that will provide us flexibility to positively impact growth and competitive position while maintaining attractive returns. As always, we'll focus on producing strong returns for our shareholders and we'll react quickly to any market conditions as they emerge. We're building off a position of operational strength to compete both with large well known competitors and smaller regional competitors to achieve our strategic objective, which is increasing market share in the Personal Property-Liability market.  Mario will now discuss results for service businesses and investments in more detail. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Glenn. Let's go to Slide 7, which provides detail on our service businesses. Consistent with the strategy to grow non Property-Liability protection businesses, the service businesses continued to rapidly grow the number of consumers protected with policies in force increasing 82.8% to 89.7 million. This is largely due to SquareTrade. We will be changing SquareTrade's branding to Allstate for domestic distribution channels, as we believe that increases sales and provides additional brand exposure without advertising investment.  As a result of unit growth, revenues grew to $405 million as you can see from the lower left table. Adjusted net income was $16 million in the quarter shown on the lower right, $14 million improvement over the prior year quarter largely due to improved loss experience at SquareTrade. We recognized the $55 million pre-tax impairment charge in the second quarter following our decision to phase out domestic use of the SquarTrade brand name.  Arity continues to invest in advancing our telematics platform and had a small loss. Total mileage analyzed is now about 14 billion miles per month and captures more than 400 trips per second. Allstate roadside services revenue was $73 million for the quarter, with an adjusted net loss of $3 million, slightly better than the prior year quarter. Allstate dealer services revenue grew 14% compared to the second quarter of 2018 and adjusted net income was $7 million. InfoArmor had revenues of $23 million with over 1.2 million policies in force. The adjusted net loss of $6 million was related to growth and integration investments.  Slide 8 highlights our investment results. Investment results were also good in the quarter as we were positioning for modest US growth by extending duration on the fixed income portfolio and appropriately matching long dated abilities with equity investments, which increased income and valuations. The portfolio generated a strong 7% return over the last 12 months, of which 2.8% was in the second quarter. Net investment income was $942 million, which included a rebound in performance based results.  The components of total return are shown in the chart on the left. The blue bar represents net investment income, which is included in adjusted net income and has varied between 80 and 110 basis points per quarter. Net investment income contributed 3.8% to GAAP total return over the last 12 months with a stable contribution from interest income on fixed income investments and a more variable contribution from our performance based portfolio. Valuations shown in grey and red vary on quarterly basis due to investment market volatility. Since we have ample liquidity we accept this volatility as it enables us to earn a higher risk adjusted return.  As you can see from the last two bars, portfolio valuations have been up this year, reflecting lower interest rates, tighter corporate credit spreads and higher equity market valuations. Increases in investment valuations have added 3.2% to our GAAP total return of 7% over the last 12 months. The chart at the right shows net investment income for the second quarter of $942 million, which was $118 million higher than the second quarter of 2018. Market based investment income shown in blue increased to $731 million from $696 million reflecting investment at higher new purchase yields in 2018 and a duration extension of the Property- Liabilities fixed income portfolio. The performance based portfolio generated investment income of $261 billion in the second quarter, which was $85 million higher than the prior year quarter reflecting strong private equity asset appreciation and gains on the sales of underlying investments. The performance based portfolio also generated $37 billion realized capital gains comparable with the prior year quarter. Our trailing 12 months performance based GAAP total return is 9.3%.  And now Mary Jane will provide an overview of Allstate's life, benefits and annuities and a special topic on the annuities business. Mary Jane Fortin : Thanks Mario. Let's turn to Slide 9. Allstate life, shown on the left generated adjusted net income $68 million in the second quarter, 12 million lower than the prior year quarter primarily driven by higher contract benefits. Allstate benefits adjusted net income shown in the middle chart was $37 million in the second quarter, $1 million higher than the prior year quarter as increased revenue was offset by higher operating costs and expenses. Allstate annuities on the right generated adjusted net income of $52 million in the quarter, which was 8 million higher than the second quarter of 2018 due to increased performance based investment income.  The special topic begins on Slide 10. The annuity business grew out of a corporate strategy in the mid 90s of running into retirement savings businesses such as fixed and variable annuities. We built a broad based business and sold a wide range of annuities through six different distribution channels, banks, broker dealers, Allstate agencies, independent agencies, institutional brokers, and structured settlement brokers. In 2006, we decided to not pursue growth throughout the main areas because we did not have the festival competitive position. The highly competitive market constraint returns much liability structures that did not properly compensate for risk.  And as a result, we began a systematic process of exiting these businesses as market conditions permitted. The variable annuity business was reinsured Prudential in 2006, which enabled us to avoid the downdraft on equity prices that began in 2008. During the financial market crisis, we continued to reduce the size of the business. We acted as a broker dealer and bank distribution channels in 2010. We stopped issuing structured settlements in 2013 and in 2014, stopped issuing all remaining annuity products from Sold Lincoln Benefit Life. You can see the impact is now on the balance sheet in the lower chart where annuity liabilities has been reduced from 75 billion to 18 billion a 76% decrease. The result is our risk return profile has significantly improved and we freed up capital.  Also, the annuities now have two primary sources of income $7 billion of deferred annuities and $11 billion of long-term immediate annuities. We aggressively manage these businesses to maximize long-term shareholder value, even if this means that negative impacts on current county returns. And we do this in four ways; operational improvements and cost reduction, using a low risk asset liability management strategy, investing in long-term assets to generate income for long dated liabilities such as structured settlements and actively managing capital. And as a result, adjusted net income from the deferred annuities is acceptable with returns is below the middle double digits, while the immediate annuities have a lower return on capital. So let's go through the four approaches on Slide 11, which provides more detail on our multifaceted approach to improve the long-term economics of this business. We have decreased crediting rates given the declining interest rate environment and contractual features such as maturity dates and limitations on additional deposit that's been in force. Approximately 84% of deferred annuities were declared great contrast of crediting rates of contractual minimum. Operational enhancements, lower costs and reduced risk and include expanded use of off shoring and simplifying administrative processes.  We are leveraging the best sources over Cali statistics available to identify the piece that wouldn't [ph] to reduce those payments. And at the same time, asset liability matching risk as a carefully controlled by positioning the portfolio so it has ample liquidity for the subsequent seven years. Expected cash requirements beyond seven years are invested in performance based assets to generate attractive risk adjusted returns for the long data structured term annuity, some of which are expected to pay out over decades. The risk and return map is laid out in the table in the middle of the slide. The table shows US corporate bond and US equity returns since 1920. And the volatility of these asset classes over different time periods is represented by the standard deviation. So let's start on the top line where you can see in grey, the corporate bonds at lower returns on a one year time horizon than equity. But the volatility has also been much lower. When you extend the time periods to 10 and 20 years the relative return of bonds remains significantly below that of equity. But the volatility convergence, which results in a much better risk adjusted return for equity. And as a result with a long investment horizon is a much better choice to be invested in equities, if you can handle the interim volatility, which we have done by ensuring your cash match to seven years. This investment strategy was favorable from an economic perspective requires additional regulatory capital, which negatively impacts reported financial results.  And as a result, we actively manage capital to further improve the returns on our annuity business. Today, the NAIC equity investment capital requirements focus at short-term reservoir similar to the volatility shown in the one year column table. We are leading industry efforts with the NAIC to recognize the long-term risk reduction associated with the most balance fixed income and performance based portfolio. Utilizing horizon based investment risk metrics should right size regulatory capital requirements. And we also continue to review strategic options to reduce exposure and improve returns with the business.  And now I'll turn it back over to Mario. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Mary Jane. Let's turn to Slide 12. We continue to generate attractive returns on capital with adjusted net income return on equity 13.5% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2019. The annuity segment however, generates returns that are below our cost of capital. As you can see from the table on the left, this reduced corporate returns by 3.7 points for the latest 12 month period. When you exclude the impact of annuities, Allstate's adjusted net income return on equity is currently 17.2%.  The components of this return are shown on the right. Allstate protection generates returns in the mid to high teens, depending on the geography and product. Allstate life has consistent low teens returns. Allstate benefits is in the mid to high teens. Investments in growth are being made in the service businesses. Beginning in 2020, Allstate will establish long-term return on equity targets, replacing the focus on annual Property-Liability underlying combined ratio. This broader and longer term measure of performance will increase the operating focus on investments, life benefits and the service businesses which in total deploy more than 50% of economic capital when you include the investments back into Property-Liability business. Today, some of the non Property-Liability businesses such as Allstate benefits, SquareTrade and InfoArmor get limited focus from the market despite the fact that they have substantial value. Just the purchase price of SquareTrade and InfoArmor is worth approximately $5.75 per share. This measure also factors in capital management actions is highly correlated with stock price, and consistent with guidance that our peers provide.  Slide 13 highlights the continued strength of our capital position and financial flexibility. Shareholders' equity of $24.5 billion at the quarter end reflects an increase of $1.35 billion over the second quarter of 2018. Book value per share increased to $67.28 or 13.7% since the second quarter of 2018, reflecting strong income generation and appreciation of the investment portfolio. We returned $664 million to common shareholders in the second quarter of 2019 through a combination of $166 million in common stock dividends and $498 million of share repurchases, which in the settlement of the accelerated share purchase program. As of June 30, there was $1.6 billion remaining on the common share repurchase program.  Now let's open it up for questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] We'd also like to ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Our first question comes from the line of Gary Ransom from Dowling & Partners, your question please. Gary Ransom : Yes. Good morning. I had a question on market conditions. You mentioned in the queue that advertising insurance has less favorable economics. And I wondered if you could comment on what you're seeing in shopping behavior or volume or conversion that might be causing that. Tom Wilson : Gary, this is Tom. So we manage the \u2013 and Steve may have a point of view here as well. We manage the advertising expenses in a quite granular level down to, whether it's top of the funnel bottom of the funnel, which state, where we are at pricing, what we're doing pricing. I don't think you should take away from that comment that we're not interested in growing insurance that we don't think we have a competitive product because that advertising is not working. There's just a small blip down I think down like 4% or something like that. Steve Shebik : Yeah, 4%, so Gary to follow up that, what we did this year was following what Tom said, we go through our economic model, we look at where we are in terms of the market. So we had a \u2013entering the year, we had a few states where we thought we will touch and go on the profitability we want to achieve. If you notice in the second quarter auto took some reasonable rates, we took substantially more rates and property also for the first and second quarter. So we got the book, we think where the profitability going forward looks good to us. And so we think that will be a better opportunity for us to advertise and grow. It never make sense to spend money in advertising when you think if some of the larger markets you may be a little bit off the placement. Gary Ransom : All right, yeah, that's helpful. I was wondering if you could comment, if you're seeing anything in the Allstate brand as well, I mean, its different distribution. But is there any trends you're seeing either in shopping behavior or quoting or conversion? Tom Wilson : I think it'd be just \u2013 first, Gary, all the industry stuff is somewhat directional, but I don't think it's as specific as what we actually achieve on ourselves. So Glenn can talk about where we're growing, in which markets. There's \u2013 the market is slightly more competitive because people are doing the logical thing, which is if they are overpriced and are higher than we are, some of them are coming down. But that doesn't mean because the percentage change is negative that they're still cheaper than us. So it really \u2013 customers buy in dollars not in percentage change. Sometimes they shop based on percentage change. But we're seeing \u2013 there's not been a huge change in shopping behavior. Glenn, maybe you want to talk about our actual results. Glenn Shapiro : Yeah, I'll just add Gary that we've had good quoting. In fact our quoting has been favorable the last year. You can see that new business results over a pretty high base here, we were up slightly a tenth of a point. So we felt good about where we were there. So we're seeing still good active movement in the market as Tom said. You can look at the CTI numbers and it was near double digits 18 months ago. Now, it's under a point. So it's a relatively rate flat environment, there's been some increase in advertising by some of our competitors. Tom Wilson : But that said we have more points of presence now of 2500 points of presence year-over-year and the quoting activities been good. And we feel good about our ability to compete. This is mark we're excited about. Like, we think there's an opportunity to grow that's why Glenn went through the quoting more money on there to invest in it like we, we think this is a great opportunity, we're in a great returns. Our brand is hunting our pricing is good, we're ready to go. Gary Ransom : Thank you very much for those answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James, your question please. Greg Peters : Good morning. My first question, I'll focus back on Slide 12 of your investor presentation around return on equity. I was hoping maybe you could expand further on how your new approach to guidance might look. One of the concerns or issues that I imagine you're dealing with is the potential changes in the denominator book value because of the quarterly mark to market adjustments for your investment portfolio. And of course, then maybe at the end of next year, you're going to be adjusting book value for the yet to be announced adjustment related to long duration contracts in your annuity business. Tom Wilson : Mario can answer the second piece. Let me just give you an over \u2013 we're doing it because we think it's a better way to talk to you about how we're doing in total. As you said, when you look at just the underlying combined ratio and that becomes the whole focus of the conversation, going to focusing on and important a significant part of the business. But it's not the whole business. And it was perhaps more important when the frequency of auto actions went up in 2015 and people want to make sure we were reacting to that. So we've done that. We've been doing it for 13 years, we've always been in there, but when you step back, Greg and look at the impact on stock price, ROE is correlated to stock price.  That's the measure we'd like to be held accountable too. We obviously manage our divine combined ratio. But if you look at underlying combined ratio, we have a very low underlying combined ratio. Other people have a higher underlying combined ratio, yet they have a higher multiple than we do. So there's not as good a correlation. So it's really about communicating to you all in the broadest way we can, there will obviously be some ups and downs as we deal with different accounting is the accounting boost and more fair value and the whole balance sheet. So that bounces around. But that's just a math and explanation issue in conversation we can have with you as to how we're doing and what we're doing. Mario, you might want to talk about the new accounting principles. Mario Rizzo : Yeah, sure. Good morning, Greg. So the first thing I'd say is just kind of reiterate to what Tom just said at the end. So the ROE guidance we give you will take into account not only the projected profitability of our businesses, but also the denominator to your point and the amount of capital we have to hold, which will include whatever accounting standards happen to be in place at that time. So we're going to factor both in to the guidance we give you. In terms of the long duration accounting standards, we're obviously well aware of it. The initial guidance came out in August, we've been monitoring it ever since. The Fazb [ph] just this month indicated that they may potentially be deferring implementation by a year or so, so it's still a little ways away. For us as we've been disclosing for a number of quarters now, the impact will be material in our financial statements. It'll principally impact our new segment and it'll really do it in two ways. The first is through updating assumptions like mortality, morbidity and lapse assumptions on a regular basis and that'll affect retained earnings when we implement it. And then the ongoing impact will actually affect the income statement. The second part is re-measurement of our liabilities using a more current interest rate, as opposed to the assumptions that were put in place at the issuance of the policy. Again, that's going to impact the balance sheet through ALCI. So we're focused on it, we're looking at it and when we have something to report, we'll give you more information on that. But in the interim, the ROE guidance we give you will factor those kinds of things there. Greg Peters : Great, thank you for that answer, Tom and Mario, I'd like to pivot for my second question to Glen's comments around the expense ratio for the Property-Liability business. I noted with interest in your results, really the pretty big improvement in both the Allstate brand expense ratio and the Esurance expense ratio. And I think Glenn in your prepared comments you talked about maybe some headwinds or some upward pressure in the back half of the year. But maybe you could spend a minute and talk to us more about what you're doing at the organization to drive an improved efficiency in the expense ratio and what we should be thinking about that trajectory, as we look out to 2020 and beyond. Tom Wilson : Yeah, thanks, Greg, I appreciate the question. I guess I'd reframe headwinds as opportunity because what we're looking to do is invest and grow the business, which is a great return business. So we have made some, some good structural movement on expenses and to turn that into some real tangible examples for you. Operationally, we've done some things like in automation; we're using aerial imagery and available data in the market, instead of going out and inspecting homes from an underwriting standpoint. So you can just think about the cost trade off of doing that. We have improved customer experience by providing better information up front, a streamlined on boarding process and as a result we have 20% reduction on inquiry calls. So that's great for the customer. But it costs money to answer the phone and it ends up taking our costs down.  Our procurement team has done a really nice job of leveraging our scale, improving our contracts and what we pay third party providers. As you mentioned Esurance's expenses are down. And that's been, Steve talked about before, some on the marketing and, and acquisition side of things. So we have some sustainable components to all of that. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, part of it a smaller piece of this is exact compensation, where we had higher targets this year for growth. Now you take that and if you take a small amount of that you create this virtuous cycle to where you achieve expense advantage and take a small amount of that and you invest in growth, you grow really high margin business, and it's ultimately a great win for the shareholders. Greg Peters : Thank you for your answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse, your question, please. Mike Zaremski : Hey, thanks. I have my first will be a follow up to the expense efficiencies you're speaking to. I'm curious, so the structural expense efficiencies, do you feel these are kind of Allstate competitive advantages or do you feel it's a first mover advantage and the rest of the industry is kind of moving in that direction as well over time? I feel like \u2013 it feels like it kind of humid talking about these things. For a while, it seems like it came pretty fast in terms of \u2013 into the income statement. Tom Wilson : Mike this is Tom. I think some are advantages. I think other places we're still trying to get our expenses down to where other people are. So I don't think we're perfect by any measure. I would say in the claims area, which was not included in the expense ratio we're talking about, I believe we're ahead. If you look at what we're doing with quick photo claim, what we're doing with drones on adjusting houses, we appear to be faster and farther in integrating that into our business processes and our competitors. But I say I believe because I don't go sit in the progressive or state farm or GEICO calls franchise, when we're looking at the industry, we think we're ahead there. There's other parts where we need to get more effective and efficient.  So you've seen that at Esurance, we brought the marketing spend down, we don't have the brain consideration for that brand yet at a point where it is efficient and effective as the GEICO brand, as they spend $1.7 billion, we spend a lot less than that. So the difference is getting smaller as we spend real dollars. But we're not where they are. So I would say that when you look first at the competitors, we're in the hunt, we're competing aggressively. But we're all working to try to reduce our expenses even better, because we can do that. So one of the things we mentioned up front is will build into integrated digital enterprise, which is about how do we use technology, data analytics and importantly process design to reduce the expenses across all of our brands. And that will lead to some additional changes in the future as we try to cut out expenses by leveraging stuff across anything would all add to that. Steve Shebik : I think the only thing I might say is we've mentioned advertising for Esurance; they have actually spent a lot of hard work, getting their other operating costs down. So you look they brought into about half of that decline in their expenses over the last year has been other operating expenses for you believe are sustainable, that's based on customer experience, improved digitization edition, just of the growth, you got to believe that 18 months and scaling, so we feel good, our position and the team is really focused on continuing that trend. Mike Zaremski : Okay, that's very helpful. And my last question is, switching gears in homeowners paid claim severity is more volatile and seems like less credible than versus the same \u2013 than the auto side. Any color on how to think about what's going on with home paid claim severity given increase to 11.7% this quarter? Thanks. Tom Wilson : Well, you're right that it's more volatiles. Glenn can talk about what we've been doing in average price, which I think is important to recognize. But it bounces around. But over time over like, rolling 12 month period, it should work its way out. But paid claim costs a lot costs a lot more than someone running into their garage door. So it messes up the severity, so it does have \u2013 it is seasonal, but over time it does work its way out. And that's what you reflected depression. But Glenn, do you want to talk about how you're taking severity and what you're doing to maintain margin. Glenn Shapiro : Yeah, it's a great point; Tom's making that home unlike auto the variation in perils creates a lot of movement in that. But we look at the overall trend. If you look at homeowner over the past six years, we produced on average of 16% underwriting profit and 84 combined ratio, but last 12 months was a 98 so 2% underwriting profit. So it's volatile, we've had a lot of weather in there and we've been recognizing that and price and you can see in the year-over-year and I always go to the average premium as opposed to the filed rates because there's a material difference between those because we have inflationary factors in. Average premium is up 5.6%. So we're definitely taking weather patterns seriously. We're looking at rate and what we need to do from a pricing standpoint to make sure we continue to deliver those long-term profitable margins that you're talking about. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research, your question please. Ryan Tunis : Hey, guys good morning. I guess just taking a step back on the expense ratio. Just looking at just auto I think Allstate's always been around a 25% expense ratio company, it was about a 24 this quarter, which is clearly good. Some of your top competitors I think are around 20 or even a little bit lower than that. I'm curious Tom; do you have a number in mind for what you think Allstate could get through over the next few years on the expense ratio? Tom Wilson : Lower is better. And we have a target, but they're not targets that we disclose. But we are working hard on things like getting great digital enterprise, using technology, putting common processes in place across all of our brands to get that down. And we're working hard. That doesn't mean Ryan, that if we see an opportunity to invest as Glenn said to get really attractive business; we're not going to do that. We will not be a slave to just getting that down. Our objective function is increase shareholder value, which is a combination of both ROE and growth. And so if we think we should invest to capture above cost of capital growth, we will do that. And we get really good returns in that business. So if you saw \u2013 is it possible that our investments in growth will go up? Yes, we said they're going to go up in the second half. It doesn't mean we're not reducing expenses that we're working hard on expenses on a whole bunch of products Ryan Tunis : Understood and then my follow up was on the Slide 11 ROE, on some of that new stuff. I mean, first of all, just to clarify, the ROE goal will include any type of drag that's coming from the non P&C business like the annuities like that's something that you have to \u2013 you're going to include and have to battle against. Tom Wilson : Ryan, we'd like to get people's opinions on that as to what works for you. We know, we want to give you a ROE goal, we think it should be in total because it ties to the thing, but it came up earlier to the extent things change like the accounting for annuities and new write offs and stuff like that. We have to have a conversation with you all to say this is we think it's a better measure. And it'll give you more insights into how we're doing including your buying back stock and everything else. So we can't \u2013 we're not going to give you the underlying math around the goal that we do and we'll establish a long-term target, which we said this is where we can run the business. But there'll be a lot of dialogue about it. This is about increasing discussion and dialogue, in shifting to a better measure. Ryan Tunis : Understood and I agree that total ROE approach makes sense. But presumably the easiest way to improve that total ROE e would be \u2013 would seem to me to be a separation of the annuities business or at least in the immediate annuities block. And I'm just curious, are there any legal entity complications that would come with you trying to part ways with that business? Tom Wilson : There are lots of ways to accomplish it legally. There's now of separation law that's been passed in Illinois, which gives us some additional opportunities. That may not be the first place we choose to use the separation of ROE, we have some other places we prefer to use it first. But the bigger issue on that one is finding sources of capital that believe that we do that you should invest on a long-term basis, take care of your customers and make sure that they have \u2013 they're protected, but that they get the right return. So it's a combination of \u2013 you clearly have complications of which company is embedded in. You can always use reinsurance, but then you get complications of the capital stuff that Mary Jane talked about. We think that the regulatory capital required to have performance space investment in long dated structured settlements is just wrong. You wouldn't invest in a pension funds like that. Nobody does and regulation supports you not doing that. And to the extent the regulation supports you being advanced, we think it's bad for policy holder, so we're just going to keep working the issue. There's no silver bullet, there was no silver bullet when we started on this. When I started in 2006, as it were just keep working. But and then on the ROE thing that may \u2013 the accounting will basically adjust to probably more than what's economic. That's not the exact way you want to get to high ROE on annuity by writing up equity. But that's what will end up happening with this principle when it gets put in place. Ryan Tunis : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs, your question, please. Rob Katz : Hey, thanks. This is Rob Katz for Yaron. So the midpoint of updated underlying combined ratio guidance has two points of deterioration compared to one half '19. So you talked about rate increases, earning in through homeowners in two half '19. And I was wondering if you could walk through the offsets. I know you mentioned potentially higher severity and of course the increased investments in future growth? Tom Wilson : Let me first \u2013 we're in a really good return in the Property-Liability business today. The underlying combined ratios and the record a combined ratio all generate extremely high returns. And so we're quite comfortable where we're at. And so we don't see this as a waving the flag that we think profitability is going to be worse or their profitability is not going to be attractive shell. So let me start there, this is a really good business with really high returns and we like it. As it relates to the quarter by quarter stuff of \u2013 what you're comparing it \u2013 what we had versus \u2013 we kind of look at really the underlying combined ratio on a 12 month basis. You can't really look at on a quarterly basis to the bounces around a lot. And what we've said is that the reduction of the guidance from the beginning of the year, where we gave guidance, we're down now point and a half, that's worth about $0.5 billion. That's a $ 1 billion. And that is reflected back if frequency is down from last year and we're assuming frequency will state down. Severity of auto of the \u2013particularly the physical damage coverage is up versus last year and up a little more than we thought when we did the original guidance. So we factored that in. And we factored in the additional growth we're doing. So it's \u2013 we don't give the component to that by quarter and you really has we're looking at annual basis, but key message, we feel really good about profitability. We like where we're at. We don't see any big changes in the market coming whether it be frequency or severity that we haven't anticipated that go into that number. Rob Katz : Okay, thank you. And just switching to the investment portfolio, was the extension in duration more of a strategic decision to offset the lower yield environment? Unidentified Company Representative : Yeah, it's John Jablonski [ph] here. As you know we had stated that we met \u2013 we dynamically manage our portfolio. And you can see that historically, we've done a number of things to do that. When you go back a couple of years, we've built up our performance based portfolio, from time to time. We will favor one asset class versus another. More recently, we looked at potentially slowing growth in the economy in the US and around the world coupled with higher interest rates as interest rates crept up last year. And we thought that it made sense in the spirit of dynamically managing the portfolio to shift emphasis a little bit. Thankfully, we did a lot of that move, we extended duration last year, about a year between last year in the beginning of this year, and it benefited returns this year, as interest rates have fallen pretty substantially. I don't know that I would view that as really taking additional risk, it's really more balancing the portfolio more closely to our long-term, objective.  Going forward, we've to Fed meeting today; I think there will be some interesting information come out of that. But what I can promise you is that we will work together as a team to look at where the best opportunity is across the marketplace. Just a couple of tidbits of information, a lot has been said about where interest rate is now and what does that mean, performance portfolio going forward. And I'll just remind everyone that back in 2016, the 10 year hit a 137, it's hovering a little bit above 2% right now. And in the period say that ensued past that, we were still able to return good returns in the workflow. And that comes from all the things that we've talked about historically, a good balance of different types of assets, whether its market based or performance based and in around the world and active management.  I would also point out that this year has been it's been an attractive year for assets year to date. Only roughly 2% of the time at both the bond market and the stock market appreciate it this much if you go back 100 years. So just taking that into consideration and we're happy that we manage it dynamically. Maybe somewhat comforting news on that though, is that when you look back at those periods historically, it's not as if the bottoms dropped out in markets after that, the 12 months that have ensued after these periods, historically it's been okay in the market, so we're watching all these information leading on our team internally, leading on, our experts and expert managers to figure out the best way from here. Rob Katz : Awesome, that's really helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley, your question, please. Michael Phillips : Yeah. Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks. My first question is, seems like a really basic question. So I must be missing something pretty basic. So I apologize. The goal here is to grow more, and you've got investments to make that happen. And you talk a lot about the investments around this country, so I guess, what I'm missing is, this quarter expense ratio was down because of lower incentive comp agents, which sounds like incentive comps would drive growth. So what am I missing there? Why would that come down? Glenn Shapiro : Yeah, Michael, this is Glenn. I would say I wouldn't lead with incentive compensation on it. I would list that somewhere down the list of things that drove the expenses. So we talked about some of the operational improvements that have been made and that has moved to expenses. But we also acknowledge that a piece of it is in management expenses \u2013 expense or management centre compensation is part of that because higher growth goals this year, but as we talked about in this call, we were working hard, we have been and we're seeing some of the things come to fruition. And we'll continue to look at expense opportunities because we consider it a virtuous cycle, you reduce expense, you invest a portion of that reduction in growth, you grow really high margin business and that's our target. Tom Wilson : And from a philosophy standpoint, we should do better every year. Like bank, we raised the targets and their advancement is not yet at this target, so they're not getting paid on that's like, okay. They're not dis-incentivized; they're hustling to get the higher target. So what is the fact on this give them good targets, balance targets, give them the resources to get it done. And so this is not it's not \u2013 it's not as direct to main line is choosing our [indiscernible]. Michael Phillips : Okay, thanks. Thanks for that. I guess, on the severity, it's risen a bit and still kind of is on. Anything, do you see any impact there from \u2013 and I think this has been asked before, but maybe can you just add any updates here any impacts from competitors that may be impacting the cost of claims? Glenn Shapiro : So this is Glenn, Michael. Indirect, it can be in there. But we've seen a trend of increasing parts prices. Now, you start \u2013 you look at tariffs 60% of glass and it's more than half of replacement sheet metal parts, do generate out of China. So you get a significant amount of impact in that space. But parts prices have been rising for the last 10 years at a much faster rate than the price of cars. And we've talked about that in past calls, because you start getting into a math exercise where if the parts prices accelerate faster than the price of the car, therefore repair accelerates faster than the cars and more cars reach that computation level of it's not economic to repair. I mean, you have more total losses. So we continue to see that trend. As we look at the past 12 months, and I know this quarter was a bigger number in some of that to the year-over-year comparison not reflective of the absolute dollars as they move. But we've seen essentially a six ish percent trend in property damage severity compared to a long-term trend to 4%. And so as we talk about our numbers and including and the guidance that we just dropped by a point and a half, we have factored in what we believe is going to happen in the auto physical damage space going forward. So all the numbers are in there financially in terms of what you should expect to see. Tom Wilson : Jonathan, we'll take one more question. Operator : Certainly, then our final question comes in the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill, your question please. Paul Newsome : I guess the other piece I wanted to ask. Tom Wilson : Hey, Paul, could speak up please. We can't hear you. Paul Newsome : My apologies, I wanted to o maybe beat the expense ratio horse just one more time. And I was hoping you can look out further into what sort of pieces you'd be looking for to moderate prospectively in terms of the expense? Is it is any sort of commission levels involved in that or is it all just operating expenses? Tom Wilson : Well, Paul, we don't get the components out. But in total, our customers want to pay less to get more. And so what we have to do is both figure out how to use less money, but then also how to improve the customer experience. So we are, for example, Glenn has an effort going to build some integrated service capabilities, where we will move work out of agencies into centralized centers, which eventually may even actually be done not needed anymore. Because once we centralize and we can figure out how to redesign the processes to make them that needed much as we've done with as Glenn was talking about getting rid of the 20% of the inquiries. So there's a variety and so that will lower costs. At the same time, we're investing in new technology for the agencies of Allstate Advisor Pro, which enables us they have a much more wholesome, broad conversation with customers about their needs and what kind of protection they have. So it's a question of managing both the expenses down and the value. Glenn, anything you would add \u2013do you want to add anything on the great service? Glenn Shapiro : Sure. I guess just the \u2013 I guess the point of detail I'll put on that if you think about our system, the value that we provide to customers, we think it's a really big differentiator as trusted advisors. We have agents across the country and people some towns that are providing them great advice on their insurance. That's the good news. The opportunity is that there's some inefficiency in providing the service in a decentralized way like that. So when you aggregate some of the transactional service components that customers don't value as much as that advice and you can do it at scale, we could take meaningful costs out of that system. So as Tom described, I think that's a great opportunity as we move forward. Paul Newsome : And my follow up was about maybe any update thoughts you have on M&A? And I think you obviously expand the service businesses, there's some talk of expanding the business, commercial businesses, any thoughts have updated in the M&A? Tom Wilson : I would say, consistent with what we talk about first \u2013 we look at stuff all the time, we're kind of sticky. And so we have to better owned, like, when we look at companies were like is there a reason for that we add value and we make this a better company. So we believe that the partnership we put together with SquareTrade has helped lead to that dramatic growth. We believe in the partnership that we're building with the InfoArmor team, where great growth is going to start selling that stuff to Allstate benefits. Its lot about distribution, we've to figure out how we get the Allstate name on it. So there's a lot of things we can \u2013 it's the middle of those ovals. That's what really, the acquisitions have to do. We don't have anything specific on the list today that doesn't \u2013 isn't consistent with the strategy. Should you talk that you had and you just talked about. So there's \u2013 well just as it comes up, you'll find us to be prudent, thoughtful. And then the other things we will do is as we've done with SquareTrade and InfoArmor, say, here's our measure of success. We acquire the company, here's the three things we think we need to do with that. And then about every six, nine months, we go through that with you and say here's how we're doing. So it's about being strategic, deploying shareholders capital well, and then being fully transparent. Paul Newsome : Great, thank you. Congratulations on the quarter. Tom Wilson : Thank you. So our strategy is to both grow our market share and Personal Property-Liability. We're hard at working that and then grow our other protection products, which we've had great success on this quarter and same time making sure we deliver what we need to do on our annual operating priority. So thank you. I will continue to work hard on shareholders behalf. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After a speaker\u2019s presentation there will be a question and answer session [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Griek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. John Griek : Well, thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome everyone to Allstate's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted today's presentation on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and discuss the strengths and leading competitive position of Allstate's homeowners insurance business. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements. So please refer to our 10-K for 2018 and other public documents for information on potential risks. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, Allstate plans to announce catastrophe losses every month, removing the current $150 million reporting threshold. The enhancements to our catastrophe announcement process increases transparency for analysts and shareholders. As many of you know, this will be my final earnings call as the leader of our Investor Relations team. As I've transitioned to a new role in our P&C finance area. I'm leaving Investor Relations in the capable hands of Mark Nogal, who will be a great partner for all of you going forward. I'll now turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Well, good morning. Thank you for joining us to stay current on Allstate. Let's begin on Slide 2 with Allstate's strategy. So our strategy has two components increase personal property liability market share, and then expand into other protection businesses. Starting with the upper oval that the personal property liability market provides consumers, protection we insure their autos, their homes, motorcycles, boats, personal liability. We use differentiated products, sophisticated pricing, claims expertise, and a building in integrated digital enterprise to lower costs, which I'm sure will come up later. We're also diversifying our businesses by expanding our protection offerings, and that's highlighted in the bottom oval. Allstate offers customers a circle of protection. It's a wide range of products from Allstate life, workplace benefits, commercial insurance, roadside services, car warranties, protection plans and identity protection. These growth platforms have extremely broad distribution, including major retailers, insurance brokers, work sites, auto dealers and manufacturers, telcos, and directly to consumers. They now comprise about 75% of our policies in force, although a much smaller percentage of our overall premiums. We leverage the Allstate brand, customer base and capabilities, to drive growth in these businesses. Some of these businesses also support the property liability businesses. This strategy creates shareholder value through customer satisfaction, unit growth and attractive returns on capital. It also ensures that we have both sustainable profitability and a diversified business platform. We move to Slide 3. Allstate strategy is delivering growth and attractive returns. Revenues exceeded $11 billion in the third quarter of 2019; Property Liability earned premium, which grew 5.6%. Strong operating capabilities enabled us to generate net income of $889 million in the quarter. Adjusted net income was $946 million or $2.84 per diluted share, as you can see in the bottom of the slide. Returns were also attracted with an adjusted net income return on equity of 14.2%. We turn to Slide 4. We also did really well on all of our 2019 operating priorities. And we have five of those, as you know they focus on both near term performance and long-term value creation. The first three priorities, better serve customers, grow the customer base, and achieve target returns on capital, are all intertwined to ensure profitable long-term growth. Customers were better served, as an - Enterprise Net Promoter Score improved. Property liability policies increased by 664,000 from the prior year quarter to 33.6 million, as the Allstate and Esurance brands grew 1.9% and 5.9% respectively. Allstate protection plans which of course was formerly SquareTrade were at 89.8 million. Total policies in force now exceed 136 million, an increase of 40.7% compared to the prior year quarter. Returns remained excellent with most individual businesses performing well. The $89 billion investment portfolio had excellent total returns and generated $880 million net investment income in the quarter. Shareholder value is also being created by building long-term growth platforms. We increased telematics usage in the property liability businesses, and that's supported by having industry leading insurance solutions from Arity. Allstate protection plan is achieving the acquisition goals we established two years ago. And sales in Europe are growing. Allstate identity protection, which we acquired about a year ago is integrating its products into our customer value propositions. Mario will now discuss our results by segment in more detail. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Tom. Moving to Slide 5, you can see that property liability results continue to reflect strong operating capabilities. Net written premium increased 5.8% in the third quarter, or $1.5 billion for the first nine months. This reflects policy growth in the Allstate and |Esurance brands and higher average premium for auto and homeowners insurance across all three underwritten brands. As you can see in the middle of the left table, total policies in force, increased 2% to $33.6 million. Underwriting income of $737 million was substantially better than the prior year quarter, due to lower catastrophe losses. Moving to the bottom of the table, the property liability recorded combined ratio of 91.6 was 2.3 points better than the prior year quarter, reflecting a planned improvement in the expense ratio, offsetting an increase in the non-catastrophe loss ratio. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes catastrophes and prior year reserve re-estimates was 85.0 through the first nine months of 2019. Moving to the right hand table, Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance net written premium increased 4.5% and 6.7% respectively, compared to the prior year quarter, due to increase policies in force and a higher average premium. Esurance, auto insurance policy growth was 5.5%, which combined with average premium increases resulted in total net written premium growth of 8.3%. Encompass written premium increased 2.6% as higher average premium more than offset a small decline in policies in force. On the bottom of the table, you can see that underlying combined ratios remain strong across our brands. Esurance reflects primarily auto insurance, which has a higher combined ratio than homeowners when catastrophes are excluded, Encompass on the other hand, reflects a 60 :40 mix of auto and homeowners insurance premiums. Let's go to Slide 6, which highlights investment performance which benefited from overall market returns and proactive risk and return management. The portfolio generated a strong 7.8% return over the last 12 months, of which 1.9% was in the third quarter. Approximately half of this total return came from interest income on the fixed income investment portfolio and returns on the performance based portfolio. The remainder was due to portfolio appreciation, reflecting lower market yields and higher equity values. The chart at the bottom shows net investment income for the third quarter of $880 million, $36 million higher than the third quarter of 2018. Market based investment income shown in blue, increased to $727 million from $683 million a year ago, reflecting investment at market yields above the portfolio yield. Performance based income, shown in grey, was $202 million in the third quarter. $12 million lower than the prior year quarter, Slide 7 highlights results for Allstate life, benefits and annuities. Allstate life, shown on the left, generated adjusted net income of $44 million in the third quarter, $31 million lower than the prior year quarter. This is largely due to the write-down of deferred acquisition costs, driven by lower interest rates and model refinements in connection with the annual actuarial assumption review. Excluding the impact of the non-cash unlock charge in both periods, adjusted net income was $86 million in the third quarter, an increase of $6 million, or 7.5% compared to the prior year quarter. Allstate benefits adjusted net income was slightly lower than the prior year quarter, as higher premiums were more than offset by increased DAC amortization, driven by lower projected investment returns related to our annual actuarial review of assumptions. Excluding the impact of the noncash unlock charge in both periods adjusted net income was $32 million in the third quarter, an increase of $1 million or 3.2%  Unlock charge in both periods adjusted net income was $32 million in the third quarter, an increase of $1 million, or 3.2%, compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher premiums. All state annuities on the right generated adjusted net income of $16 million in the quarter, which was $4 million lower than the third quarter of 2018, due to higher contract benefits and reduced investment income. Adjusted net income of $43 million for the first nine months was substantially below the prior year, reflecting lower performance based investment income in the first quarter of this year. Let's turn to Slide 8. Service businesses continue to grow the number of consumers protected with policies in force increasing 67.7% to $95.9 million. This is largely due to Allstate protection plans. Revenues increased 27.1% to $418 million, as you can see from the lower left table, due to growth in Allstate protection plans and Allstate dealer services, as well as the acquisition of Allstate identity protection last year. Revenues to the first nine months now exceed $1.2 billion. Adjusted net income was $8 million in the quarter shown in the lower right, a $7 million improvement over the prior year quarter, largely due to improved loss experience in Allstate protection plans and Allstate dealer services. Slide 9, highlights the continued strength of our capital position and financial flexibility. In the third quarter, we issued $1.15 billion of 5.1% fixed rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. The proceeds from this issuance were used to redeem $1.13 billion of fixed rate perpetual preferred stock with an average dividend yield of 6.54%. These actions will lower annual dividend costs by about $16 million. We continue to deliver excellent returns to shareholders. In the third quarter of 2019, we returned $775 million to common shareholders through a combination of $166 million in common stock dividends and $609 million of share repurchases. We have repurchased 6.7% of common shares outstanding over the last 12 months. Book value per share is up over $9 over the last 12 months. Now, I'll turn it over to Glenn, who will discuss our special topic of Allstate brand homeowners insurance and how we are positioned to generate industry leading returns while growing market share. Glenn Shapiro : Thanks, Mario. Homeowner's insurance is a great business for Allstate, as you can see on Slide 10. Allstate is the second largest homeowners insurance in the United States with 6.6 million policies in force. We have written premium, $7.6 billion in the Allstate brand over $400 million in Encompass. And Esurance is also expanding into homeowners insurance, using Allstate's capabilities, and now it's over 100,000 policies in force. A significant portion of our customers bundle home in auto, which improves retention, and overall economics of both product lines the key message on homeowners insurance as it generate substantial underwriting income and attractive returns on capital. To achieve these results, we target an underlying combined ratio in the low 60s to handle volatility that comes with catastrophe losses. Since 2012, we've generated over $1 billion of underwriting income on average annually, including catastrophe losses. As a result, returns on economic capital are in the mid to high teens. This profitability also provides diversification to auto insurance profitability. The graph at the bottom of the page shows homeowners insurance combined ratios for Allstate and the industry since 2012. As you can see, Allstate has consistently outperformed the industry. The results is that we've earned over half of the industry-wide underwriting income in that period. Turning to Slide 11. Allstate optimizes returns through sophisticated portfolio management. We've improved returns and decreased homeowners insurance volatility through advanced catastrophe modeling, geographic diversification of business and strategic use of reinsurance. Our spread of the business across the country works to our advantage by providing a significant diversification benefit as timing, type and magnitude of weather events differ based on geography. As you could see on the U.S. map, we have a top three market share in 20 states which are shown in green, but much lower shares in states like California and Florida prone to catastrophes like wildfire, earthquakes and hurricanes. We take a proactive approach to managing our exposure to different types of risks. We substantially reduced our exposure in California to earthquakes by helping establish the California Earthquake Authority in 1996. And we've decreased our underwritten policies in force there in the last decade. In Florida, we reduced our market share from about 10% in 2003, to less than 2% today. We also helped shape the Florida hurricane catastrophe fund, which provides reinsurance. And we use a separately capitalized company there, Castle Key and process external reinsurance. The overall objective is to meet customer protection needs while optimizing shareholder risk and return. We underwrite risk directly where we can achieve target returns. We also broke a nearly $1.4 billion of other insurance property policies. This allows us to meet our customer protection needs, leverage our distribution strength with more customers, bundle additional Allstate products, but not directly right risks outside of our underwriting appetite. In total, we manage our portfolio of states to target a combined ratio that generates attractive returns. For new competitors in homeowners insurance, the state level \u2013 profit dynamic makes it difficult to them to achieve the same level of overall profitability or have the resources to expand. We shift an extensive amount of catastrophe risk to reinsurance markets which reduces our capital requirements, and protects annual returns. The reinsurance program covers individual large events, utilizing traditional reinsurance and alternative capital. The current nationwide reinsurance program provides over $4.3 billion of limits above a $500 million retention for any single event. We also use an aggregate cover in case there are multiple events below $500 million. This provides additional protection in case the accumulation of those events throughout the year exceeds $3.5 billion. Moving to Slide 12. We're not standing still and we're constantly innovating in this space. We're focused on customer value and ease of doing business to accelerate growth. We streamline the homeowner quoting process by using both proprietary and third-party data sources to increase efficiency and accuracy. Using this information, we've reduced the number of questions asked in the quoting process from over 40 to just three when bundling homeowners and auto insurance together. In many cases, after our quote is complete and we bind coverage, there's an inspection of the home. Technology, such as aerial imagery and predictive modeling has enhanced the speed and efficiency of those inspections and lowered our expenses. We continue to enhance the design of our homeowner\u2019s product while increasing our pricing sophistication. Our homeowner\u2019s product house and home is better able to address severe weather risks and unique customer needs. For example, the product includes a graduated roof coverage schedule, though it still provides the ability for customers to \u2013 purchase full replacement if they choose. House and home now represents 90% of our new business and about 45% of our total policies in force. The pricing of house and home is more sophisticated than traditional homeowner\u2019s insurance products with more occupant and residents characteristics. We've also improved the efficiency and effectiveness of our claims handling through technology and innovation. We leverage our scale, data, and analytics, to rapidly deploying more than 700 full time catastrophe resources to quickly help customers when they need it most, while mitigating damage and managing costs. We use aerial imagery to improve our efficiency and customer experience. We've expanded virtual claim handling capabilities, including the use of drones, airplanes and satellites, so that now nearly 70% of all wind and hail claims have some aspect of the claim handled virtually compared to less than 10% in 2017. The bottom line is Allstate has a significant competitive advantage in homeowners insurance. We'll continue to leverage our scale, pricing sophistication risk management, distribution system and claims capabilities to deliver industry leading returns and market share gains. We'll now open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question please? Elyse Greenspan : My first question, I wanted to spend some time on the expense ratio and property liability. It's been low now for a couple of quarters and I know last quarter, you guys had pointed to a combination of improvement in processes, automation, as well as incentive comp is driving down the second quarter expense ratio. You could just give us a sense if it's kind of the similar components that drove down the ratio in the third quarter, and just how we should think about modeling through that expense level going forward? Glenn Shapiro : Yes thanks Elyse, it\u2019s Glenn, We're definitely focused on improving expenses. We've been faster this and going after it hard. I mentioned a few of the examples last quarter where, we've been able to reduce customer inquiry calls, which is a win-win, because it's better customer experience, because we've eliminated the need for those calls on the front end, but it also is more efficient on the back end. I mentioned in special topic there some of the aerial imagery and data analytics we're using in both claims and to reduce inspection. So we've gone after some real tangible ways we can manage expense. As with any quarter there is a mix of things in there. So similar to last quarter, there is some components to compensation, some components of marketing, some components of sustainable improvements in the baseline of that. But, we've made some real tangible improvements that we will sustain and we're going after expenses in a real way, because we think it's a path towards growth where we can, maintain margins. Elyse Greenspan : Can you breakdown give a little bit of color on what might be in a sustainable bucket versus maybe, what was kind of one-time in nature in this quarter and the expense level? Glenn Shapiro : I don't know that there was a lot of one-time in this. So we've got, where it is sustainable. It says operational improvements, which is, a meaningful chunk of the change that we've got. When you look at some of the compensation components, we've managed, both are, employee compensation and agency compensation over time and you reset every year with a new program. So there's a little bit of benefit in there from that, that we were short to our growth aspirations in the year but otherwise we've got sustainable, expensive prudence in here. Tom Wilson : Elyse one place this time, one place, we would like, this quarter was marketing, which we will dial up as we talked about last quarter, we're dialing out there, there's some select markets where we know that we can generate economic growth. That said, that won't change the overall trend line of expensive should be coming down over time. But you know, every quarter is new quarter so. Elyse Greenspan : And then my second question on, we've seen some of your peers that have seen higher bodily injury severity trends within their auto book of business, or just could you just give us an update on what you're seeing on the BI severity side and just - if you've seen any pockets where trend is pick up in the U.S.? Tom Wilson : Let me give you, first we can't comment on everybody else's numbers because, as in bodily injury, those are long data claims it takes three, four years to really get them paid out depending, the little ones get closed early, the big ones get closed late. So you always have some bounce of mix in the paid BI that you have to get underneath. That said, we feel good about where overall bodily injury reserves are set and our trends Glenn can talk about the pay trend. Glenn Shapiro : Yes, so we feel good about where we are in bodily injuries we put in the Q, you know we\u2019re running around medical inflation. As Tom mentioned on the reserving, it's all in the numbers I think would be a headline there because in our reserving actuaries so talented folks, they work very closely with our claims team, our underwriters, our product organization, they all work together to ensure that we have, the right reserves on the book. And if you look at the trends over time, we've had, a lot more favorable development and unfavorable development through the years, which is, good, bellwether for you to look at in terms of our overall trends. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question please. Greg Peters : My first question, I'd like to revisit of how your guidance is going to look for 2020. John I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks that they're going to start disclosing monthly cat loss numbers. I also remember from a previous presentation that you said you were going to shift from an underlying combine ratio target to a target return sort of guidance. And just wondering if this is a trailing ROE target, do you plan to adjust it for changes in interest rates, et cetera just looking for some color there? John Griek : Well Greg thanks for the question. We love the fact that you are paying attention to what we say makes real good. The monthly cat numbers it's just a clean up what people are like, is it above 150 what if it's 149 we felt like it was confusing stuff. So we're just put out monthly you can do what you people, everyone is got different things they use it for. So just to make your lives easier and that\u2019s more transparent. As it relates to the return on equity as we're replacing the annual underwriting - underlying combined ratio guidance with longer term ROE goals. ROE is a better measure of the overall business results because it includes first includes our businesses and includes investment incomes and ties directly to reported results which includes catastrophes. The underlying combined ratio of course, only reflects their property liability businesses, and it excludes catastrophes which bounce around a lot from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. But on a long-term basis as a management team we're accountable for making sure that we get a good return on homeowners with catastrophes included it because that's the risk our shareholders take. So, what we're going to do when we report full year 2019 results is give you what we think a long-term ranges on return on equity and debt management should be held accountable to. Greg Peters : What do you define as long range and is this adjusted earnings that it's on? John Griek : Yes, it will be on adjusted earnings just because the accounting - as we move to fair value accounting the book value and reported income bounces around a lot with equity investment. So we feel like adjusted net income return on equity is a better measure of what we want to do. Long-term would be sort of what do you expect to do over two to three years but the goal really is to get people focused and our shareholders focus on what's the overall return we're generating and the capital you have and focus on the overall side of the business, as opposed to just one component. And while auto insurance and homeowners insurance are extremely important to our business, so we are not the only thing we got going, and that the only thing we should be held accountable to. So ROE is just a much better measure under which you can judge how well you think we're doing as a team. Greg Peters : Great, thank you for that answer. My second question is, I just a follow-up on the expense. I noted from the Page 9 of your supplement that your agency count was up, year-over-year and sequentially, and your license sales professional account was up, year-over-year and sequentially. And I'm trying to reconcile this with the fact that you're not reporting any restructuring charges, which is unusual, considering the improvement you've realized And then secondly, on previous call Glenn has mentioned something along the lines of an integrated services platform, and so the numbers are kind of moving contrary to what I think that would be. So maybe you can provide some additional color there? Tom Wilson : Well let me deal with some components, Glenn can talk about what we're doing with our agency platform to make it more effective and efficient, including things like integrated service and what we're doing in compensation to drive that growth. As it relates to restructuring, we do end up with some little minor restructuring charges that go through there in the Q someplace, but they're not big numbers. As we move forward, as we move through integrate digital enterprise we just record what we think we have to record under the rules. If it means, we have, headcount go down because we're using integrated digital enterprise and we have to record a charge that we do it. But we don't feel like there is one big bucket that's needed at this point, that we then carve it out and don't come back and hold ourselves accountable for because it's some other charts in place. Glenn Shapiro : So yes, thanks for the question Greg and as Tom said you\u2019re definitely paying attention to the details in there. So if you look at the agent council start with that, some of that it\u2019s a reflection of, the investment folks are willing to make in the business based on the opportunity, and there's good opportunity with Allstate. And we are, we're growing items and we're profitable and been successful. So, agents are putting their nickel down, these are small business owners who are opening up a shop and going out and selling product and serving the needs of consumers. In terms of the license sales professional that's reflective of their hiring, they're doing mostly on the sales side of that. Now that said, I'll mention as Tom said, a compensation component leading into next year, as well as the integrated service that you brought up. From a compensation standpoint, we're leaning more of the compensation towards new business production. We're interested in growing so as we increase marketing, we've improved our expense we'd be more effective and cost effective for customers and we  -- be more effective and cost-effective for customers. And we lean more into new business production in terms of the compensation as we shift that in that direction. We think that's a good system wide approach to go drive growth. In terms of integrated service, we have talked about it before. It's in the early stages. It's a big system. We have 40,000 people in that agency system, when you take the agents and all of their employees, licensed and unlicensed, sales and service. So today we do that service in a decentralized way. A lot of the service is done in individual offices, which you're not scaling, is not ultimately going to be as cost effective as you can do it in a more scaled way. So we built an integrated service model. We're doing that with - we're getting into hundreds of agents, not thousands of agents, at this point. So, from a scale perspective, you wouldn't see it showing up in the numbers that you looked at there at this point. Tom Wilson : And Greg, just the change in agency compensation, we don't expect to raise overall compensation as a percentage of premiums. Glenn Shapiro : Correct. Yes, it was a shift. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please? Yaron Kinar : Can you talk about the increase in property damage frequency and Allstate brand auto this quarter? And are you guys sort of just little surprised to see that given the more recent trends? Glenn Shapiro : So first of all, I always like to go back to the overall profitability of auto, and we're doing very well. They're 92 combined ratio, some of that is the expenses and I'll come back to sort of some of the intentionality there. Frequency, first of all, it's hard to predict. You can't predict what is going to happen in the next year, next quarter, but you can understand the trends and where things are moving. So miles driven, we're up. We saw some change in what had been a declining trend to frequency. That said, it was a little bit mixed. So I'll point you to a few different numbers. Gross frequency was up two points, as you pointed out. But paid frequency, which on a short-term tail line tends to be pretty accurate, was flat. And BI frequency was slightly down. So I look at the overall frequency picture and say : It's kind of a mixed story in there and something that we're keeping a close eye on. Now you go a level below that, and at a local level, every state manager is out there looking at their competitiveness, their trends, their frequency, their severity in every state. And we're managing that profitability at that local level. So that's what rolls up into a really favorable return, as we've delivered. And then lastly on expenses, I want to keep going back to that because part of the reason or the main reason you go after expenses the way we are is actually allows you to let the loss ratio float up and deliver the same return. And that's what it looks like in our ratios when you're giving back more value to the customers. Yaron Kinar : And then the second question going to homeowners, also saw an increase in severity there. I guess just given the amount of pricing that the companies has pushed through over the last year, I was still surprised to see the deterioration, actually your loss ratio from a pretty weak prior year quarter to begin with, even when that increase in severity. So can you maybe talk about that dynamic of maybe where the severity has come from and why the price increases we've seen to date have not been sufficient to offset it? Tom Wilson : Homeowners is one of those businesses where it's really difficult to look at it by quarter, what happens with severity. Because it's obviously impacted by weather, sometimes its cats, sometimes it's not a cat. And so you have to really look it on kind of a rolling 12-month basis. And when you look at our business, it's got great returns. We feel really good about it. If you look at the average premium, it's way up. And when you go underneath that, and as Glen said, we'd like to segment this down, then we segment it by state, we segment it by coverage. And in homeowners, depending what kind of loss you have, it changes your paid severity a lot. And again, those tend to be relatively short tail line. But so a fire loss has a much different severity if the house burns, then obviously if somebody runs into the garage door, or hail damage can tend to be much more expensive because it could take out a whole roof than some leaky pipes. So it really depends. The mix drives a lot of it. Theft is not as big as water damage. So, what I would say is Glenn's comments on this special topic, we feel really good by homeowners. Like, it's a really good business, making really good money, much better. And I want to just underline what I said. With a 9% share of the market, we've captured half of the overall profits generated in homeowners in the industry. So we feel like that's indicative of good operating expertise and capabilities. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your question please. Jay Gelb : My first question was on commercial auto and the ride sharing agreement with the major providers there. One other competitor in that market has had some issues negatively. So just wanted to understand how Allstate is going to position that business? Steve Shebik : So let me start off and say, that we call it a shared economy business, so it's not just lunch share and car sharing. We look more broadly. And so obviously you've focused on the largest customer we have, but we have a handful of others that we're building an entire team to have knowledge all around that. Obviously, we are well aware of other competitors in the industry. And the particular competitor you talked about, strengthened their reserves in the 2016 and 2017 year when the industry was kind of early in development. We started last year, and if you remember, I think in prior calls I've talked about how we triangulated our loss reserves on the basis of the prior history that was provided by the transition network company that we used our own internal, both personal lines and commercial auto experience. And we've also looked at industry experience and our telematics type of information that we get \u2013 we're just at state level. Because remember, we have 15 States we're insuring, not the entire country. So we're comfortable with where we're sitting. We're still recording essentially at the priced amount for the reserves, primarily because the vast majority of the coverage is the long tail coverages. So it's still early, 19-months since that first month. I think long tail coverages historically take longer than [indiscernible]. It's still coming along through us. We look at it every quarter. As you may remember, independently, our reserves are reviewed and set by a team that works in claim reserve, looking for Mario and not for me. So we had different eyes on it from our actual department, from our financial department, obviously in the business too so. [indiscernible]. Does that answer your question? Jay Gelb : It does, it does. And then on a separate topic, thinking about the underlying combined ratio in the protection business - the underlying loss ratio, excuse me. Having that show an increase year-over-year, my sense is some investors are a little concerned about what's going on in terms of price competition in auto and then also the potential for claims inflation to increase. So can you just remind us how Allstate is managing that issue to restrain underlying loss ratio deterioration? Mario Rizzo : Yes, Jay, let me provide some overall context and Glenn can jump in on the relationship between expenses and loss ratio. So, first, as you know, our auto insurance has largest product line. It comprises about 65% of our total premiums and it's obviously an important lead line as well because it helps us expand into the homeowner's insurance business, which is also highly profitable. So it's a really important question : Are you going to maintain your profitability on auto insurance so you can keep growing it? But before we go into the specifics on expenses and loss ratios, let me just talk about principles for a minute and a little bit of our history. So we have some guiding principles on our growth. First, we only want to grow when we get a good return for our shareholders. I mean, it seems simple, but it's not everybody follows that path. And as you know the auto business generates really attractive returns, it's in the low-90s when you add that and homeowner's insurance to the equation that's a big driver of our return on equity, which was 14.2% for last 12-months. But when you adjust out annuities, it's over 17. So we're getting a really good return on that business. So what we've put in place has been, it's been working. Secondly, we do segment the business by in terms of growth and profitability by business, geography, customer group, and risk, so that we get attractive margins in each segment. And that gives us that solid base from which we can be sustainable in terms of growth. So if auto margins drop in one state or I want coverage, we had the benefit of good margins than auto insurance in another state or on another coverage or in the homeowners business. Our third principle is we create shareholder focus, or create shareholder value by focusing on profit and growth at the same time, but we default to profit if necessary. And so, we employ that philosophy across everything we do. So for example, let's go to insurance and you know, when we first bought insurance, it was running a combined ratio well over 100. And we invested heavily in that. We believe and know now, that their growth created shareholder value because the return on the business we were writing was higher than our cost of capital. The accounting however, required us to write up all the advertising expenses up front, which resulted in an underwriting loss. So after the first year of course, then that advertising expense goes away you capture all the underwriting profit and it's very profitable. And so, it took a while before that profitable business can offset the negative of first year business think over when you spend $200 million a year on advertising. So as a result that growth reduced underwriting and even though it's positive for shareholder value. So we try to think about are we creating shareholder value. Our first principle we\u2019re creating shareholder value when we're doing this. We can do it and we chose to do it on insurance because we had strong profitability coming from the Allstate brand, auto and homeowners business. And so the concept of portfolio growth, Glenn talked about how it applies at the auto insurance level, it implies for homeowners. It also applies across the whole company. And so now, insurance is two and a half times the size when we bought it. A similar situation exists for Allstate protection plans. So we acquired square trade, which has been renamed also a protection plans a couple of years ago for 1.4 billion, which is equivalent to about four bucks a share the Allstate share. As you know now their business is over twice its size we got 89 million policies enforce its got great distribution, its growing the European cell phone business and now it has reported profits albeit small, reported profits. And so valuing that business on an earnings basis, clearly understate shareholder value. So our challenge has been to make sure we give you the information to see value creation, but not get everybody so focused on the 65% of the business, that that's the only thing that matters in terms of creating shareholder value. So it's a really important question, how are you growing that two-thirds of the business to make sure you make money. But I also wanted to just take this opportunity to say like, don't forget about everything else, because there's a third of the rest of the business that drives shareholder value that when we get so focused on just auto insurance margins, it takes people's eye off the other stuff, which is why we moved to ROE. But obviously, we're very focused on auto insurance profit. We feel really good about it. And we need to make sure we keep doing that. So Glenn will talk about what Mario mentioned is our intentional strategy to grow the business, offer really good value to our customers by reducing our expenses. And then having the loss ratio drift up, which enables us to maintain margins, and still keep clocking that high teens return on equity from that business. Glenn Shapiro : Yes, so thanks, Tom, you know as you way out the principles there, clearly we're in an environment in auto that meets those growth principles and so, we want to go after that. But that said, its environment we've chosen to grow in, but it's a competitive environment, we got significant increases in advertising out there. We have an extremely low CPI. So we acknowledge all that in terms of the competition and we're doing things smart as to how we grow as opposed to chasing it. I think you could call our combined ratio now a little bit of a restructured combined ratio because as you point out Jay, the loss ratio was up, the expense ratio was down. I would argue that it's a lot better than the other way around. That if you think about sustainability, if we were here having this conversation and we were like a point or two up on expenses but we had a huge tailwind because frequency to drop through the floor in the quarter. I think we\u2019re - having a different conversation. So I look at this as a as a positive, sustainable way for us to go after growth and show that we can do it in a way that's going to continue to provide that, mid high teens return. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your question please. Mike Zaremski : I guess I'm staying on the expense ratio improvement which is enabling you to grow more. There was a media reporter to about shifting certain customer service responsibilities out of the agencies and into call centers which can service customers, potentially more cost effectively. I'm kind of curious if that's part of the reason agent compass is falling and why maybe a permanent decline or just you can correct me if I'm totally off on that? Tom Wilson : First I may go up for a minute, Mike and say we want to use technology and our people to do a really great job for our customers. And with what you can do in technology today, you can make your people a lot more productive, and make them give a great service and spend less money. So, we've talked multiple times by a quick photo claim with a productivity of a claim adjuster is multiple to what it used to be because they're not driving around from body shop to body shop. They're sitting in front of a computer, looking at pictures, deciding what should be done with their customers. So that's ripping through our business. We have lots of ways, we're working on doing that and that's what gives us the confidence that we can do a better job for our customers with less expenses. Glenn talked about integrated service, which is the thing you're referring to, and you don't see it in the numbers. It would be what I would say today. It's not you know, we started with 50 agents this year we're getting the processes down. We're not going to turn this loose on 22 million customers, until such policies until such time as we make sure it works really well. Because the system we have works really well. Our net promoter score was up again this quarter. We like what our agents are doing that said, we think we can do better by leaning into innovation, rather than go. So you're not seeing anything on integrated service that\u2019s the media I think you're referring to. I mean there is so much media out there these days. I don't know whether it's fake news or not, but like \u2013 the reality is, as we are doing everything possible to give our customers great service, support our agencies, but do it in a cheaper way. And we're all in on that. Mike Zaremski : Okay, great that's helpful. And lastly, Glenn, in your prepared remarks, you could I might be a little off. You talked about the state level profit dynamics, making it difficult for competitors to achieve all states homeowner\u2019s profitability. Maybe you can elaborate on that. And also, I'm curious if there's any parallels to auto insurance as well? Thanks. Glenn Shapiro : Yes so, thanks for the question on it. I think the basic premise there is, you know, we have a lot of scale and we've got, breath across states in our blend in our mix across the state is not only a 50 state view and so we've got it everywhere. But we've also been thoughtful and made choices about where we're larger and smaller, given the types of risks we face, which really challenging for the smaller or newer carrier going into it. It\u2019s getting that type of breath across a system where you can offset your highs and lows. It's similar to, what you do with an investment portfolio. You're mixing your investment portfolio in different ways so that when one thing is up another one is down, and you're getting an overall good return, that's really challenging if you're starting out and you're only allowed to buy four stocks. Tom Wilson : Let me also add to that, so let's just compare homeowners to auto insurance. So homeowner\u2019s is more volatile on an individual location basis than auto insurance. So you should put up more capital for homeowners insurance than you should for auto insurance. In addition, with homeowners insurance, you get very little investment income visits are relatively short tail way as opposed to auto insurance you get a decent amount of investment income off it. So as a result of that you have to run a combined ratio in homeowners insurance that's below that would you run in auto insurance. So your combined ratio and homeowner should always be below your combine that's not true for everybody but so in total, you got to get there. The problem is it like if there is hail in Dallas one year, and then not for two more years. There is hail in Oklahoma, because it got dumped in Oklahoma before it got to Dallas the next year. And so, if you're only in Dallas and you got to earn that low combined ratio, and the hail happens to get you in that year, it's pretty hard to then have the money to expand into Oklahoma. So that's what Glenn is talking about. But the businesses, when you look at the homeowners business, and as more people get into it, I think it's worthwhile focusing on what is their actual return on capital in that business, as opposed to just growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Your question please. Crystal Lu : This is Crystal Lu and for Ryan Tunis. Our first question again on the expense ratio. It seems like the expense ratio has improved a lot, but it doesn't seem to be translating into auto policy growth acceleration yet. And it seems like some of that expense improvement came from advertising, which tends to grow to drive growth. So I'm wondering what actions are being taken right now, where you're investing in growth and going to see that policy growth acceleration in the future? Tom Wilson : Well, first, if you look at our auto insurance growth, it's about two points, which we think is more than the number of cars and have grown in United States. So we think we're picking up market share, albeit a small amount of market share and we'd like to have more. So we are investing more in marketing, but that doesn't change the overall trend that Glenn talked about. I mean, we're going to - our overall trend is reduce expenses, be competitive at price, maintain margins at levels that are attractive. Is it going to be the same level each quarter? It bounces around a lot depending on what frequency happens, but we liked the returns. We're good at getting returns in auto insurance and we have proven that we can grow it and we're going to work on keep producing expenses so we can continue to be competitive. Crystal Lu : And on the auto rate increases that you guys have been getting this year, it doesn't seem to have slowed very much in the first nine months, despite efforts to pass along more savings to customers and grow the business. So can you kind of describe the auto pricing environment right now and how you're thinking about auto pricing in terms of growing? Tom Wilson : Yes, thank you Crystal. First of all, we manage all of our pricing and state-by-state basis. And I would say, in terms of the slowing, I would look at it relative to the lost cost trends. And so I would say it's slowed. We've taken over trailing 12 months, 2.2 auto rate that's translated into an average gross premium of 3%. But if you look at the severity trends running five this quarter, in the trailing 12 months, higher than that, we've not had rate that keeps up with that. And as we talked about earlier, we've offset it with lower expenses and that's where you give more value to the customer is not taking rate that has to keep all the way up with those types of inflationary factors. But, as Tom has said several times, we managed this for profitable growth and we're committed to a strong return. And when we look state-by-state at that, we're looking at our competitiveness, what our price looks like relative to our competitors by different customer cohorts in each market, but also, what our return on all of his cohorts are in each market. And so I think our pricing has trailed the lost trend, which is part of what we're offsetting with the expenses. Glenn Shapiro : It's hard Crystal to, and I'm not trying to - it's really the level of sophistication of pricing today in auto insurance is so high that, while the numbers overall are important to maintaining looking at the trend in the margins and definitely look at those. In terms of growth, a lot of it depends what sales you're growing in, what your new business discount is. There's a lot of things we do, and our competitors do to make sure we capture business, which is generates long-term economic growth. So it's, but - it's a pretty, it's not a robust, we're not seeing people take a bunch of rates right now, you know, state farm's taken some decreases but given where they are in overall price, we think they probably need to take some price decreases because they're pretty high priced. We feel competitive like price right now. Crystal Lu : That makes sense. And then one more quick one on the auto bodily injury reserve releases this quarter. Could you just give a little bit more detail on what accident years are those are coming from and whether that reflects the level of severity being in line with medical inflation. Is that running at a lower level than you were expecting in those years? Thanks. Mario Rizzo : So Crystal, this is Mario. I guess the first thing I'd say is just reiterate what Glenn said in terms of - we establish reserves and look at reserves every quarter. We have some pretty robust processes that we follow. We take all relevant facts and circumstances both internal and external trends into account. And then we also take into account any changes in claim handling practice. So we have a really thorough reserve setting process and we tend to be conservative in how we set those reserves. What you saw this quarter in terms of the releases, we're predominantly in all state brand, auto injury coverages, and we continue to feel good, not only about the severity trends that we're seeing in the current year, but we're seeing favorable development in the prior years that is better than what we expected when we established the reserves. So it's really coming across a number, a number of accident years but we continue to feel really good about our reserve position, and our injury severity trends. Tom Wilson : And the amount from each prior year wouldn\u2019t really help you. So it's because it's what we picked as opposed to what the trends - the absolute trends are, but when we do the cadence there's obviously the triangles are in there and so. Operator : Our final question then for today comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your question please. Josh Shanker : Yes, thank you. I was looking at the policy count numbers in auto and it seems like there's a slowdown, but I'm wondering if we can sort of break it down to gross policy ads versus a gross policy declines. Are Allstate customers sticking with you and the new customers have slowed. How should we parse that out? Tom Wilson : That's a pretty detailed level of question, Josh. So first overall retention was flat this quarter basically for statistical reasons, I mean it's kind of down slightly, but it's basically flat. So that means we're keeping in total as many or as a percentage of our customers, as you're correct in assuming that a new business doesn't have its higher retention as people have been with you 10 years. By the time somebody has been with you, actually, people don't wait two, three, four years. They pretty much tend to stay with you really high retention levels. So growth will drive your retention down despite the fact that we were growing over last couple of years. Our retention has gone up because we're doing a better job on customer service with our net promoter score up. So I don't - I think in terms of our overall growth, you should expect to see more of it come from new business in the future than further increases in retention, if that's helpful. Josh Shanker : And when I look at the decline ad spend and I guess compensation to agents or maybe right thing that incorrectly, or is that directly tie-able to the amount of new business coming in? Tom Wilson : You sound like you're looking at a specific number. Maybe what we can do is Glenn can answer for you what the new comp. So we're going to - we'd said we could spend more money in advertising. We're working on that and we expect to still bring our overall expenses down as we do that over time. May not be every quarter, but we're headed down in that direction. And then - but Glenn can talk about what we're doing on compensation. Glenn Shapiro : And a quick add I'll make to the marketing because this has come up a couple of times. It's during a year-over-year basis the marketing was lower? On a sequential quarter basis, it was up. We're comparing to a quarter last year where there was a new brand launch and you know, so, but we're ramping up and we'll continue to do that with marketing. From a compensation standpoint, as we talked about earlier, it really is about shifting towards new business production. You ultimately, you compensate agents for the service they provide to customers and for going out and punting and getting new business, and we're within the confines of that amount of money, that compensation system, we're shifting money towards new business production to incentivize that more in the compensation plan going into next year. Tom Wilson : So, what we're trying to do is, go on a great customer value proposition. We want a good price. We want good service. We're lowering expenses. You should expect to see us continue to lower expenses as we go forward from here and then as loss ratio goes up, that just means you\u2019re offering greater value. They're paying less for expenses and more for fixing stuff that got broke. Josh Shanker : Thank you for the answers and good luck with that. Tom Wilson : Okay. First, thank you for being on the call. Let me thank John for being both a transparent and direct source to you for a little over three years. He's done a fabulous job. We are excited to see him move on in his career and I know Mark will do a great job. He's worked with John, so it'll be seamless for you and us. As it relates to Allstate, yes, we made really good progress this year on our strategy, our operating priorities remain focused on profitable growth, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Mark Nogal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Nogal : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome everyone to Allstate's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted today's presentation on our Web site at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and further contacts on our recently announced transformative growth plan. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements. So please refer to our 10-K for 2018 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Well, good morning. Thank you for joining us and stay current on Allstate. Let's begin on Slide 2 with Allstate strategy. So as you know, our strategy has two components to increase personal property liability market share and expand into other protection businesses. Starting with the upper oval, we've been a leader in creating differentiated insurance process features, such as declining deductibles new car replacement. We used sophisticated pricing, have strong claims expertise and are building an integrated digital enterprise to lower costs. We're also diversifying our businesses by expanding our protection offerings, which are highlighted in the bottom oval. We leverage the Allstate brand, customer base and capabilities to drive growth in these businesses. So we offer customers a circle of protection that includes Allstate life, workplace benefits, commercial insurance, roadside services, car warranties, protection plans and identity protection. These growth platforms have extremely broad distribution, includes major retailers, insurance brokers at the worksite, auto dealers, manufacturers, telcos and directly to consumers. On the right hand, you can see that this strategy create shareholder value to customer satisfaction, unit growth, and attractive returns on capital. It also ensures we have sustainable profitability and a diversified business platform. You move to Slide 3, Allstate strategy and continue to deliver excellent results in 2019. Revenues were nearly 11.5 billion in the fourth quarter and 44.7 billion for the full year 2019. Net income was 1.7 billion in the fourth quarter and $4.7 billion in the full year. Adjusted net income was 1.02 billion or $3.13 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted net income rose 11.1% compared to the prior year, to $3.48 billion or $10.43 per share. That reflects excellent underlying profitability and lower catastrophe losses. Returns were also excellent with an adjusted return on equity of 16.9%. If you turn to Slide 4, Allstate delivered in all of five 2019 operating priorities, which focus on both near term performance and long-term value creation. The first three priorities, better serve customers, grow our customer base and achieve target returns on capital, they are all intertwined in it just to ensure profitable long-term growth. Customers were better served as Enterprise Net Promoter Score improved at most of our businesses. Total policies in force reached $145.9 million, which is an increase of 20.7% compared to the prior year. Property liability policies, which are now our bigger dollar amounts, increased by $428,000 for the prior year to $33.7 million as Allstate insurance brands grew 1.3% and 2.3% respectively. Allstate protection plans, which of course, was formerly SquareTrade, continued its rapid growth due to the addition of a major retail partner with items in force reaching $99.6 million. Returns remain excellent, driven primarily by strong property liability results. The underlying combined ratio of 85 finished 2019 at the favorable end of our revised full year guidance of 84.5 to 86.5. And you\u2019ll remember as part of our second quarter earnings release last year, we had improved this annual outlook range due to excellent operating results. As you know, Allstate's no longer going to provide underlying combined ratio guidance since return on equity is a better measure of performance, and Mario is going to provide some additional context on this measure. The $88 billion investment portfolio generated $3.2 billion in net investment income in 2019, which reflects higher market base portfolio yields, which was offset by lower performance based results. Performance based results were below expectations for the quarter, but longer term results have been strong. Total portfolio return was 9.2% in 2019. Shareholder value has also been created by building long-term growth platforms. We announced new features of a transformative growth plan, which we\u2019ll discuss next. Arity continued to expand capabilities. Allstate indemnity protection is growing and launches new digital footprint offering and avail a car sharing platform initiated operations. You move to Slide 5, let's discuss the transformative growth plan to increase property liability market share. The plan is build on our strengths and reflects current competitive conditions. Allstate has a significant number of competitive strength, as you know, particularly in property liability we have the Allstate brand, we have pricing sophistication, claim expertise, product breadth and a broad distribution platform that goes from Allstate agents to Esurance's direct capabilities to encompasses independent agents. As a result, we're growing but GEICO and Progressive are growing auto insurance market share faster through massive advertising spending and low cost structures. Our plan also recognizes that customer needs are changing due to increased conductivity and advanced analytics. Our leading positions in telematics and digital auto collision estimates are two examples of how we're embracing these changes. At the same time, a majority of customers prefer Allstate and insurance agent, we hope an Allstate insurance agent, when purchasing a policy, but are comfortable with self service. So we're increasing mobile application capabilities and building low cost centralized integrated service capabilities. We're now accelerating these efforts with a transformative growth plan, which has three components. Expand customer access, improving the customer value proposition by lowering expenses and redesigning property liability products and investing in technology and marketing. Standard customer access will be provided by utilizing Esurance\u2019s direct capabilities to sell Allstate branded products. Esurance has strong direct capabilities, having more than doubled in size since it was acquired a little over eight years ago. As a result, we can further leverage these capabilities by selling Allstate branded policies directly to consumers. This will require us to reposition the Allstate brand and the advertising previously deployed for the Esurance brand will be shifted to the Allstate brand and then the Esurance brand will be phased out in late 2020. Expense reductions will improve affordability, while funding investments in technology and marketing. We'll also strengthen the independent agent platform by merging the Allstate independent agent offering into Encompass. This is a comprehensive plan that will make us a stronger competitor and lead to increased market share. Now let me turn it over to Mario to go through the property liability and investment results. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Tom. Let's go to Slide 6, where we highlight strong results within our property liability segment. Policy and premium growth continued and all of the brands had strong underlying profitability. Underwriting income of $1 billion in the fourth quarter was significantly higher than the prior year, driven by lower catastrophe losses and the continued improvement in the expense ratio despite increased marketing investments and the write-off of the remaining Esurance acquisition and tangible related to the brand name. Moving to the table, net written premium increased 4.4% in the fourth quarter and 5.6% for the full year, driven by policy and average premium growth in Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance and the Esurance brand. Total policies enforced increased 1.3% to 33.7 million in 2019. Underwriting income of $1 billion in the fourth quarter and $2.8 billion for the full year, were substantially higher than the respective prior year periods, driven by continued progress on improving our cost structure, average premium increases and lower catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio shown in the bottom left, which excludes catastrophes prior year reserve estimates and the $51 million pre-tax impairment charge related to our decision to utilize the Allstate brand for direct sales, was 84.9 for the fourth quarter. The 2019 results of 85.0, was at the favorable end of the full year guidance range of 84.5 to 86.5. Focusing on the table on the bottom right of the page, you can see our recorded combined ratio trend overtime by line of business, as well as total property liability. Auto insurance profitability remained strong with a combined ratio of 92.8, excluding the Esurance impairment, increased average earned premium and lower property damage and bodily injury frequency offset higher severity in 2019. Property damage severity continues to be impacted by higher costs to repair vehicles, while increase -- which increases the number of total losses. Bodily injury severity increased at a rate above medical inflation indices, but we factor these severity trends into our pricing algorithms. Homeowners insurance continues to generate excellent returns. Lower catastrophe losses were significant in achieving a combined ratio of 88.4 for the year. In total, Allstate has industry leading combined ratios for our property liability businesses. Let's go to Slide 7, which highlights investment performance for the year and the fourth quarter. Our investment portfolio total return for 2019 was 9.2%. Net investment income contributed 3.7% to total return with a stable contribution from interest income on fixed income investments, but a lower contribution from our performance based portfolio. Higher bond and equity valuation contributed 5.5% to total return in 2019. The chart at the bottom shows net investment income for the fourth quarter of $689 million, $97 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2018. Market based investment income shown in blue increased to $735 million and benefited from proactive actions we've taken, including a duration extension in our property liability portfolio. Performance based income shown in gray was lower than recent trend and included lower valuations of $74 million pre-tax on two private equity limited partnerships. Given the performance based portfolios impact on recorded income, let's turn to Slide 8 to review the purpose, makeup and results of these investments. Our performance based strategy delivers attractive long-term risk adjusted returns and is well suited for long dated liabilities and capital. The strategy diversifies our portfolio through idiosyncratic equity returns that complement our market based strategy. The portfolio is broadly diversified by asset type, including private equity and real estate, as well as geography, sectors and partners. We invest in funds, co-invest and have direct investments as well. The $8.7 billion portfolio had a one year return through September of 7.6%, and three and five year returns of around 11%. While idiosyncratic investments generate higher returns, they do create income volatility, as you can see on the right. The portfolio generated $469 million of investment income in 2019, but all of that occurred in the first three quarters. In 2018, the portfolio generated $716 million of investment income and $145 million in the fourth quarter. We continuously monitor the portfolio and do not believe the lower valuations on two private equity investments in the fourth quarter are indicative of the broader portfolio. Slide 9 highlights results for Allstate life, benefits and annuities. Allstate life, shown on the left, generated adjusted net income of $76 million in the fourth quarter and $261 million for the year. The fourth quarter improved by $7 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher net investment income and lower operating costs. The full year income of $261 million was 11.5% below 2018 due to the third quarter write down of deferred acquisition costs in connection with the annual actuarial assumption review, which reflected lower interest rates. Allstate benefits adjusted net income of $16 million in the fourth quarter was $10 million below the prior year quarter. This decline was primarily driven by the write-off of acquisition costs related to the nonrenewal of a large underperforming account. For the full year, adjusted net income of $115 million was $9 million below the prior year. Allstate annuities, shown on the bottom right, had an adjusted net loss of $33 million in the fourth quarter, driven by lower performance based income. Adjusted net income of $10 million for the full year 2019 was below the prior year, reflecting lower performance based investment income in the first and fourth quarters. Let's turn to Slide 10. The service businesses continued to grow the number of customers protected with policies in force increasing 42% to $105.9 million. This is largely due to the increase in Allstate protection plans. Revenues grew 21.9% to $434 million in the fourth quarter, reaching $1.6 billion for the full year 2019. Adjusted net income was $3 million in the fourth quarter and $38 million for the full year. Adjusted net income increased in 2019 compared to the prior year period as improved loss performance in Allstate protection plans and Allstate dealer services were partially offset by continued growth and integration investments at Allstate identity protection. Slide 11 highlights the excellent cash returns provided to shareholders. In 2019, we returned $2.5 billion to common shareholders through a combination of $1.8 billion in share repurchases and $653 million in common stock dividends. We repurchased 16.4 million or 4.9% of common shares outstanding over the last 12 months and increased our book value per share by more than $15 to $73.12. The $3 billion share repurchase program announced in October 2018 was completed in late-January 2020. And yesterday, the board approved a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization to be completed by the end of 2021. We also reduced the cost of capital in 2019 by redeeming multiple series of preferred stock and issued two new series at lower rates, which will reduce preferred dividends by $17 million annually. Let's move to Slide 12 and discuss our long-term return on equity goal. Starting this year, we will no longer provide annual property liability underlying combined ratio guidance, but instead discuss returns on equity. As we've discussed over the past two quarters, this is a better measure of our performance for multiple reasons. It is a broader long-term measure of performance than the underlying combined ratio, which focuses on just one part of one of our businesses and excludes significant items, such as investment income, catastrophes and other protection businesses income. It factors in capital management and is more correlated with stock price and it fosters a better comparison with our peers. On a long-term basis, our adjusted net income return on equity goal is 14% to 17%. This range also aligns with executive compensation as discussed in our annual proxy statement. Now we'll open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse, you might have your phone on mute. Elyse Greenspan : So my first question is on your ROE target, the 14% to 17%. Just a couple questions there, if we can get a sense of what you define as the long-term? And then how you see kind of 2020 coming-in in reference to that 14% to 17%? And then my last question on that thought would be, are you going to go into any particular details on the returns that you're charging within that within property liability versus your life related businesses or services? Mario Rizzo : First, let me deal with the second question first, we're not going to give out a number for 2020, which goes to your first question. Which is when you look at this kind of like rolling three-year basis like over a three-year period cats go up and down, things go up and down and we should be able to earn 14% to 17% return. We got there by really looking at a couple of things versus what's the level of economic rent we can capture by how good we are in a market we operate in. And so as you know in the property liability business, we run a substantially more favorable combined ratio than the industry and that's for a substantial amount of economic return. We also look at it from what's the appropriate risks -- what's the appropriate return for the risks that our shareholders take, and we feel like 14% to 17% is a good goal for us to have over that three year basis. I don't think you should try to use this to decide what 2020 forecasts are, there\u2019s lot of better ways to do a forecast. We're not going to break it out by component, because our goal here was to get up to the corporate level and say what are we doing in total, because with the underlying combined ratio, we basically zoomed ourselves in including you all into how well was auto insurance doing that we\u2019ve neglected to focus on the other opportunities to do. Obviously, the 14% to 17% includes a whole bunch of components. So the annuities, as we\u2019ve talked about before, are a large drag on that. So if you were to intuit between the 300%-plus drag that has on ROE to the other businesses, you would say the other businesses are higher return. And of course, most of that is property liability but that will change over time. Obviously, the acquisitions, like purchase of Allstate protection plans, obviously, that business is doing extremely well from our standpoint is well above its acquisition targets, but it does put a drag on ROE. Interest rates would go the other way, particularly in the Property-Liability portfolio. So what we did was stand back and say, what do we think is right over time on kind of a rolling three year basis. Elyse Greenspan : And then my second question, you guys rolled out your new growth related optimization efforts in December. Just want to get a sense, as you kind of change your commission structure a little bit. How you envision that playing out in terms of both pick up a new business growth and any kind of drag you see that having on the underlying loss ratio, I guess, specifically to auto book? Tom Wilson : Well, let me maybe go up for a minute and ask Glenn to talk about the commission changes you're talking about for 2020, which I think the specific ones you're referring. So transformative growth is a multiyear effort we expect it as both expanding customer access, improving customer value and investing in technology and marketing, to help us grow market share. The improving value will be done two ways, one reducing expenses. And that's expenses across the board and we can talk more about that later if you want, but it's really across the board and redesign the property liability projects. Glenn did make some changes to the commission structure for 2020, which he can talk about. Glenn Shapiro : Elyse, we've got a few things going to stimulate growth in what is a very competitive environment right now. So we're pleased that we're able to keep growing. And to the second part of your question, deliver returns. So I'll answer that part first. Do we expect it to, as we grow to deteriorate returns? I would say no, because we've evidenced that, we're pretty disciplined about that and we've been -- as we've grown, we've kept our eye on the returns. But the specific actions, one, are you referring to the change in compensation. We move some of the compensation variable comp from agent renewals to new business to incentivize growth. We want to pay folks for growing their business. We're also putting more into advertising and managing our lead management platform. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Greg Peters : My first question will be around the expense ratio improvement that you guys generated in 2019. I think that's probably the biggest surprise, at least from an outside observer perspective. In some of your previous comments, you said there was some benefit for incentive comp. So I guess my question is, around how much of that 90 basis points was sustainable considering the strong results that you posted last year, is that going to boost up the incentive comp for 2020? And then dovetail the expense ratio improvement with what kind of anticipation, or expectation should we have about continuing improvements? So should we factor in some modest improvement every year? I know you guys are rolling out the integrated services platform, et cetera. Tom Wilson : Greg, let me take it incentive. Mario can talk about expenses. So we said incentive comp targets every year. And so we have two measures, one is -- or 2 programs. One is the annual incentive plan, which is management's compensation program and that\u2019s at every year based on how well we did the year before. So it's not like you get a couple of years. We also have obviously a longer term plan, which is our performance stock rewards, which are tied to return on equity. So those you shouldn't expect fall over from one year to another as it relates to expenses. If we exceed the targets established by the board then obviously, we have to put it into the P&L, but presumably that's because we're making more money than everybody thought. Mario Rizzo : I just would add a couple things. So first, I think we're continued to be pleased with the progress we're making on expenses. And as Tom talked about earlier, it's a core part of our transformative growth strategy. And one of the ways that we're going to further improve the customer value proposition and create the capacity for the growth investments that he alluded to. So our work in this area is not done. We're going to keep focusing on expenses and look to drive down the expense ratio. One thing I'll add with the fourth quarter specifically, the impairment charge related to the Esurance brand was worth about six tenths of a point on the expense ratio. So if you look year-over-year, you see some real meaningful improvement in the expense ratio in the quarter that gets a little bit masked by that non-recurring charge. Greg Peters : Mario, is that where the Esurance expense ratios I think, was up 27.5% in the fourth quarter. Is that what you're talking about? Mario Rizzo : Yes, it\u2019s in the expense ratio, so worth about six tenths to the overall property liability number, obviously, more of an impact to Esurance specifically. Greg Peters : The second question, I guess, just pivot to the performance based investments. Obviously, it's generated a strong result for you over a long period of time, but there's volatility. And this past year, there was volatility. And for outside observers, can you provide any guidance for us and how we should think about that volatility as we think about 2020, the 2020 outlook? Tom Wilson : Let me make an overall comment about investments, and John can go to the more color on performance base, recognizing we don't like to give next year's projections out there. We proactively managed our portfolio and John's created and used a really comprehensive capital allocation framework that helps the investment team decide what and when to invest and it keeps track of the decisions we made and not just investments we made but so we can track those, but also any opportunities missed or any losses we avoided. So we watch our money well and it's on all ports of the portfolio. So John can talks about what we do, how we deploy that and performance base and what it means. John Griek : When you go up and think about the whole portfolio, it helps put performance base in context and why we like it. The portfolio is about $88 billion in size, majority of its invested in high quality fixed income instruments and about 18% of that is equity and roughly half of that is performance base. So just to kind of size it within the overall context. We like performance base because it focuses on private markets and really expands our opportunity set investments that we can play with and allows us to create in our belief a more efficient frontier, a more efficient portfolio that's well suited to our overall liability and capital structure. What comes with that is increased volatility on income. And we believe that and we expect volatility, we expected it in the past and we\u2019ll expect it going forward. We believe that we're compensated for that volatility of income. In this particular quarter that volatility, especially if you look at it year-over-year on a quarterly basis, the difference was $97 million and about 74 of that was tied to two investments. That obviously was a disappointment but we've gone back in and we recognize that we look at the underlying investments here. They range from timber and agriculture, to real estate, to private equity, to a number of different investments in there. It's hard to pin down with great precision in any given quarter how that's going to play out. So I would expect continued volatility. We have also gone through, and as part of our regular risk and surveillance processes, looked at all of our holdings as we normally would do and believe that this was not a -- and this was a bit of a one off type of quarter. We remain confident in effort going forward despite this performance in this quarter. We believe we have a strong team. When we look at measuring this, we really look to longer term measures. We look to three, five and 10 year and some of those measures are in the investor supplement, and those tend to be holding true. So we really are changing our overall commitment to it and expect while there may be bumps in the road in any given quarter that long run it's an important part of what we do. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Paul Newsome : I was hoping if you just give us a little bit of an update of how you see the current pricing and competitive trend in auto. Obviously, last year was a pretty competitive year but if you think that things are stabilizing industry wide or not, love to hear your thoughts? Tom Wilson : This is Tom, let me make a couple of overall dramatic conversations and then Glenn can talk about what he's seeing in the market by competitor. But our philosophy has been to for, as you know, profitable growth and long-term profitable growth. So we raise prices when we think we need to when the trends show we should do it and so we don't get behind on it. We're not big in terms of reducing price to try to grow like we, I'd like to say around here, anybody can lose their way to increase market share and that's not our plan. The other thing I would say is you always have to be careful of the percentages, because it always depends where you start. So we have some competitors who are higher price than us and they're reducing their prices and other carriers who are lower than us and certain risks, and they're raising the prices. So Glenn can talk about the percentages. And there are obviously some overall macro trends at work in auto insurance pricing but I just -- we have to be careful not to be too specific as to what it means for next quarter sales. Glenn Shapiro : And as Tom said, I think I\u2019ll lead you to one set of numbers that I think tells the story. Our average premium in auto was up 3% year-over-year and our average loss and expense was up 2.5%. So we were disciplined in managing to a positive return and actually made a little progress during a time where, as you said, it was very, very competitive out there. We did see some competitors take sort of broad based rate reductions, which is why the overall CPI is negative, that as Tom said, not a trend we\u2019ll follow or something we subscribe to, we look state-by-state. To your question about what we're seeing more recently is it stabilizing, I would say, I'll give you the qualified yes, there is a little bit more rate activity starting to flow into the market. You're seeing less price reductions or really no price reductions in the recent past and you see some increases out there. So I\u2019ll call it more stable. Paul Newsome : Second question, obviously, on the commercial line side of the world, there's a lot of conversation about basically casualty related inflation trends. I recognize that's on a huge part of what you do as an auto and home insurer. But could you talk to whether or not you\u2019re seeing that in the fairly modest pieces that are casualty parts of your business? Tom Wilson : Paul, are you talking about bodily injury costs that we're assuming\u2026 Paul Newsome : Well, actually I'm thinking more pure liability and home insurance business, for example, flips and falls, and lawsuits, and things of that nature? Glenn Shapiro : So not seeing much of a trend on the home side on that, our trend set are more meaningful for us on the home side really are the mix between frequency and severity of our property, first party losses. So we're not seeing really anything on home. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : First question is around net premiums written growth. I think it's slowed down a little bit. And I guess in particular you see a little bit of a slowdown in the renewal ratios and then new applications, especially in auto. Can we maybe talk about that and maybe how that ties to the transformative growth plan? Tom Wilson : First, as I said earlier, it's all about profit growth for us, the transformative growth plan should bring our expense ratio down and enable us to improve our competitive position, which should drive to higher growth in 2019 throughout the other different stories in the Allstate branded business than Esurance business. So Glenn, maybe you can talk about the Allstate branded business. And Esurance for 2019 was still under Steve, now of course under Glenn as part of our transformative growth. But Steve maybe you can pop in on Esurance. Glenn Shapiro : So I'll start us off. And just at a high level, I\u2019d tell you we feel good about the fact we were able to grow in a really competitive market, as has been pointed out before on the call here, negative CPI, premiums up 5.5%, policies in force grew across all major lines. And it's hard work to do that in a competitive environment. So it's challenging. To your point that moved down a little bit in the fourth quarter, but we're still in the upper bounds in that sort of call it the upper third of our long-term trend on both retention and new business. We're coming off the high base here. And we're taking the actions short-term as we build out transformative growth, taking the actions short-term to grow, which I referenced before, of changing agency comp where we're shifting more towards new business, putting more into marketing. Steve Shebik : So for 2019, insurance had about 8.5% increase in net return premium. So for the year, it feels good but that trend declined throughout the year and the fourth quarter was only 2.6%. And we did, as you know, we grew fairly rapidly last year also. And so we have that new business penalty and in some states, we took some fairly significant rates more in the second half of the year. So that really slowed down our growth as we went into the third and fourth quarter. Overall, we feel good about the growth we had, we feel good with where the business is positioned going forward but we have to be probable. Yaron Kinar : And then my second question just goes back to the ROE guidance range for the next three years. I guess what would be the largest components that would drive ROE to the upper end of that range or the lower end of that range? And does that range also contemplate the possibility of this disposition of the annuity business? Tom Wilson : I would say there's a number of components here, there's what\u2019s your -- the obvious piece is, what's your combined ratio and underwriting income that's impacted by what your underlying is also what catastrophes are, which as you know bounce around. There's what happens to investment income and we've talked about that today. There's also the amount of equity you have at play and so, we've been building equity but we're still buying shares back, so that has an impact. As it related to the future, this is kind of an is business model approach. We didn't assume anything was going to change as mentioned to Elyse is that things will change in the future, but we still feel like 14% to 17% is the right range. But lots of stuff could change, the interest rates could go up and interest rates go up, for the Property-Liability business, most of that income falls right through the bottom line. And if you look at our investment income over a long period of time, we are down substantially. Now we've made that up by reducing the combined ratio and improving underwriting income, but that will change over time. Obviously the annuities business will be a positive. To extent we decided to invest in growth in an acquisition, that would be a negative. So we felt like in total the 14% to 17% was a good goal for us, but it changes as the world changes then we'll let people know. But it's a three year kind of rolling average for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : Just a follow-up on the transformative growth plan and just trying to get some sense for when you think we should start to see the benefits of those changes start to roll through in terms of more competitive product and then an uptick in new applications, better retention and higher PIF growth after we've seen a bit of a deceleration in all those metrics? Tom Wilson : David, first, it's a long-term plan. This is going to take us multiple years to do. But there's obviously components of it and some parts will have a bigger impact early and other parts will have a larger impact later in the game. So we expect early in the plan that expense reductions will play a significant role in us improving our affordability for customers, and getting to that second part of improving the value proposition. As you go forward, we would expect that redesigning our technology -- our property liability products will drive more differentiation. So we were first to market with decline the deductibles, first to market with new car replacement. There are other ideas and things we have in place that we think can drive more value, but it's going to take more time to put those into the marketplace. So those in terms of improving the customer value proposition, expenses first redesign products later. The redesign products is later is in part it requires a new technology platform, which is the third piece. We have to invest more in the new technology platforms, particularly our product management platform and our customer experience layer. So that will take us a while to do. We think we can still cut expenses and reduce the overall expense but why we are investing in those and that's our goal. But at the same time, we're going to invest more in marketing earlier in the process, because we believe that will drive growth. And Glenn talked about what he is doing to enhance the Allstate agent value proposition, whether that's increasing new business commissions, or freeing them up by taking low value work out of their offices and putting it into integrated service. The other piece is to expand the access, and that's happening as we speak. So the access to people who called for the Allstate brand who got on to our Web site in Allstate brand, had some restricted rules on it, which we've started to open those up now. So for example, if you called during working hours, you could get a different experience and if you called after working hours, you should have the same experience. Like you're getting online, it shouldn't matter what time of day you do that. So we're changing those rules. What Glenn is also doing is taking the Esurance capabilities, which are exceptionally good in direct. He's putting those together with the Allstate branded capabilities, which do some direct today. And that will then be utilized for the Allstate brand that will take us some time to do. One obviously, you\u2019ve got to put all the operations together, and call centers and get the technology to work the same and get the order -- the flow on the Web site, all to be the same. We also need to reposition the Allstate brand. And so the Allstate brand, of course, is extremely well-known, great unaided awareness, high trust marks, people \u2013 it\u2019s one of the great brands of the world and that said, it's not viewed as modern as Esurance is. So Esurance built for the modern world, a little hit a little cleaner. So we are working hard on reposition the Allstate brand so that it brings both of those together so that we both serve our customers with agents when they want them and we serve them direct when they want. So it's a long-term plan but you can see there's -- its front end loaded on some parts and back end loaded on others. David Motemaden : And just with the customer value proposition and some of the increases in the bodily injury severity that popped above CPI, medical CPI, this quarter, which is the first time I think in a bit it has. Have you, I mean, is that already embedded in your pricing? Or is that something that would I guess go the other way against some of these expense saves that maybe able to pass through more competitive rate? Glenn Shapiro : Yes, I'll take that. This is Glenn. And yes, we've seen some of the trends come through that you've heard about from others on bodily injury. It is embedded in our reserve position that we have where we think through these things, as we set our reserves, as we set our pricing strategy. As you've seen over the last couple of years where we've run hot on physical damage severity and yet really hasn't flowed through to the margins, because we're pretty quick at adapting from a pricing standpoint and on a market-by-market basis. So I would tell you we\u2019re watching it, we've got good process. We have a great claims department that looks it, both the technology and the process that they followed to handle claims. And where it goes beyond what claims can manage whereas they're paying claims accurately, we get it into pricing quickly. David Motemaden : And then if I could just speak one last one in, just in terms of the high-end of the ROE guide. And I guess just thinking about potentially like there have been a few transactions in the fourth quarter on the life side, and it seems like there's a pretty vibrant interest, a lot of interest in some of these run off books of annuities or life insurance. Just wondering -- and in Illinois, I believe there's a division of company rule that can allow you to carve out specific reserves out of that Illinois legal entity and divest to a potential acquirer. So just sort of wanted to get an update on your view in terms of, your thinking in terms of like whether you see any opportunities there to potentially reinsure or digest that book and maybe get to a more sustainable high-end of that ROE guide given it has like a 300 bp drag on the ROE? Glenn Shapiro : It is a third question, but this is different than the other ones, I will take. But I also -- let's try to -- there are other people in the house. The answer is, we've been trying to -- we've been working on annuities for a whole bunch of years trying to get it better. We made a lot of progress to extent there is something else we can do it, where it\u2019s use the division statute to get a different solution reinsured. If we can do it in a way that is economic for our shareholders and has a good risk adjusted return, we'll do that. And if we do that, I don't think anybody would be unhappy if we were -- if you looked at, if we were above the upper end of the guidance. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Amit Kumar : Actually two quick follow-up questions, the first I guess is in response to the previous question on the shift in the plan, the new plan. Can you give us any early sort of feedback from agents? Number one on the integrated services platform, and number two, also, what is the feedback on shifting the bonus and/or the commission structure from existing and new businesses? Tom Wilson : I mean I think we got it. We were all leaning in towards the steep curve to make sure I heard it was a low light. So I think Glenn can talk about the integrated service and commissions. Maybe let me go back to transformative growth and make comment really on behalf of the customer. So the agents are part of our team. We want them to be successful. We're leaning in hard to make them successful. They drive a bunch of our business and we're going to work hard at making them successful. That said, there's a range of opinions as to what people think about what you're doing. But let me come back to the customer. What we are trying to do with transformative growth is stick with our customer philosophies. And one of our philosophies is you should pay a fair price for the risks you create. We're very sophisticated in the way we do pricing. We get telematics, which is the new end of it with Drivewise. We also have a philosophy that customers should get what they pay for. And as it relates to the auto insurance same things apply. So if you get extra service then you should -- and extra advice from the help of an agent, there should be something you should be prepared to pay extra for. If you want to do all stuff yourself then that's something that's a different price value proposition. So we are working hard to make sure that that agent value proposition is as effective and efficient as it can be. Like people as we said, I think we said when we talked about this, that over half the people want an agent and it's higher as it reflects our customer base. So we want to help them be as successful as they can and that's why Glenn is working on the couple of programs he is. Glenn Shapiro : Yes, I'll just add to it. We talked to our agency force all the time talking to agents every week. We've got national advisory council, regional boards. We spend a lot of time with our agency force. And I\u2019ll give you the range of reactions. So on the -- overall, the facing out of transformative growth, we're going to pull the marketing in from Esurance as the Allstate brand, as you might imagine wildly popular. Like everybody feels really good about the fact that there's going to be more marketing in the pipeline and we're focusing on the Allstate brand. On the commission change, you got folks that they were growing fast and they're built to grow. They liked it a lot, because that leads right into their strength. You got folks that really weren't growing or weren't built to grow, you have a range of folks who are either excited about making that transition and retooling their business, or ones that say I wasn't really ready to retool my business. But they need to in order to earn the commission that goes with the new business, the higher new business commission. As it goes to integrated service, as Tom said, lots of different opinions out there. It really is about freeing people up for growth. And what I can tell you is the folks that are in it are growing faster than the folks that aren't. So we think we're creating something that's going to be really valuable for the agency force. Tom Wilson : So if you go back to the customer and what blends higher new business when you ask customers, where does an agent add the most value, it's almost always on either the purchase of the product are doing an insurance review, helping me sort out stuff, very little of is on changing address. And so that's what Glenn's working on. Amit Kumar : And very quickly on the lost cost trend, I know you briefly talked about it. But net-net, can you talk about either when you look at the frequency and severity trends. Is the expectation that this is how it sort of remains for the foreseeable future, or what\u2019s your outlook on the loss cost trends here? Glenn Shapiro : So I'll take that. This is Glenn. Let me go up a little bit, because I think if you look at the whole system and you say, there's premiums that come in and how we may changes to those overtime to these expenses that are going out the door, and then you split your loss costs by frequency and severity. Over the past year, three out of those four have been going well for us. Our premium, as I mentioned, autos up 3%, average premium -- home is up 5% average premium, the respective loss and expense on those lines are 2.5 and 4. So we've made up a half a point and a full point in terms of actually improving over the time period. So it's hard for me to say, I can't predict that severity will be flattening or up more over a year, two years from now. But what I can tell you is we've been really disciplined about managing it quickly into each market on a market-by-market basis. Our pricing sophistication, our state management team, has gotten better and better and we're able to react in real time to those changes and manage to the types of returns that we've been able to deliver. So while I can't give you a perfect prediction on where the severities will go, I feel really good about our ability to react to it in real time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : Couple for Glenn. So Tom mentioned it over half of Allstate branded customers one in Asia, I thought that was interesting. In terms of just like the pathway of becoming an Allstate brand customer, what percentage of people I guess start on the Internet, Google insurance or something like that. And is that the lead generation mechanism, I guess just digital or the Internet versus an Allstate agent as a little league coach or something like that? Tom Wilson : Ryan, Glenn can give you through some of the percentages we give out but this is not and/or conversation. A lot of times people are like, well, they want to buy direct or through an agent. It's an and. Like, we'll sell to people anyway they want. You want to start online, buy from the agent, call an agent buy online, like we're just there to. Like, we want to sell as much as we can to as many people as we can through as many ways as we can. Glenn Shapiro : It's a challenging question, I'll tell you, because there's a lot of stops in the process where for example, people go online, they start to get a quote and the agency that's nearest to them pops up with that quote and they decide to drop off, make the phone call and that's one path, there's multiple paths people take through. The vast majority of our business is written by a local agent. That said, all the data and research out there tells you that the vast majority of people start their process online and at least get some understanding and then want to talk to somebody about it. So we've got a mix of that and imperfect data for me to give you any more specifics on that. Ryan Tunis : And then I was hoping if you could give us a bit of a peak on some of these new product initiatives. I guess, in particular, I'm trying to understand the price sensitivity or whatever. I mean, obviously, your captive agent. Are you thinking new business pricing down 10% or something like that? I'm just trying to understand like, how much of a driver do you think that is for potential new issued applications? Tom Wilson : I am not sure we understood the question. We're not --maybe you could rephrase it. Ryan Tunis : So I'll ask it this way. Like two three years ago, travelers who's obviously an independent agent player, they just announced that they were cutting new business prices by 10%. I could see how that could have more of an impact, and like an agency distribution channel versus a captive. I'm wondering if that\u2019s how you see it as well or if you think that -- am I missing something or is there a similar level of price elasticity in captive is what you might see in agent, like could that be a big driver for growth. Tom Wilson : Let me maybe start with the last piece and work my way up, and anybody else wants to jump in. So first, it's of course always hard to tell how much price elasticity is within an agency. In general, you would think that an agency that had multiple companies and could share those multiple quotes for you there would be more price elasticity than in a captive agent. That said people can call around the three or four people and get their points of view. So auto insurance in particular is price sensitive. Although, we've talked at length us trying to have profitable growth, I guess what we're trying to do. The redesign of the products is on all of our products, auto, home, and a variety of different products where there are things we think we can do to make them less complicated. And so for example, this year, we rewrote the renter's policy in one state and took its size down by 40%. That gets to less complexity, helping customers understand it, so we're doing the proper. But we also have a variety of other products in the circle, protection we're trying to get to. So we don't sell identity protection today through our Allstate agents. Make sense that we have customers that come to Allstate agents, probably would like to get their identity protected. How do we do that? How do we get the systems to work? How do we get the technology platform do it, how it\u2019s factored into compensation and everything else? It\u2019s something we're working and that\u2019s part of transformative growth on a longer basis. So we have many products we sell through many channels but we don't sell all of our products through all of our channels. And that's part of transformative, because it\u2019s how do we sell more of what we sell already in more of the places that we sell. Ryan Tunis : Thanks. Tom Wilson : We probably have time for one more question. How about one more question. Operator : Our final question then for today comes from the line Michael Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Michael Zaremski : First question if -- the P&C investment portfolio, the duration has increased fairly measurably over the last few years and up to five plus years now just curious as you continue to see that elongating. Are you kind of at the high end of your kind of the range you're comfortable with versus kind of duration of liabilities? John Griek : Mike, it's John. Look, you never know exactly what the future holds. So we're always going to respond to economic conditions, overall risk and environment of our firm and structure of the portfolio that way. I would say that what we've seen in terms of the duration extension in recent time and a lot of that's taken place in the last 18 months was more of a reaction back to strategic norm. As interest rates had been rising prior to that with the cycle that the fed was in, we thought that it was prudent to stay a little bit short and look to recapture higher yields that are better -- when there's a better opportunity. We couple that with a little bit, if you go back 18 to 24 months so the economic situation in the U.S. in the world was different. It was software at that time and it wasn't clear that policymakers were going to engage, they\u2019re in a tightening cycle. We thought that they needed to engage, we also wanted to put a little bit of inflation protector or recession protection back in the portfolio, when you have more duration. If the economy falls off, it tends to help your portfolio and balance it out more. So we did actively highly coordinated internally with all our risk processes, extend the duration. It had a number of benefits that we're pleased with. It did increase income, which is a positive. It also did build in a more balanced portfolio, balance at our risk based assets. And if you look at --this isn't perfect math, but if you look back at where rates were when we did most of extension relative to where they are today, it's been a great price increase in our fixed income securities. Rates are roughly market yields when you include where treasuries were and where corporate are roughly about 100 basis points lower than that time. So going forward, we'll continue to monitor. What I can assure you is that it will be highly coordinated inside. Tom talked earlier about our numerous processes, our capital allocation process with investments. We also work very closely with our enterprise risk group to make sure that these are -- all our moves are well understood. And we believe that proactive management investment portfolio is a way to add value to the enterprise. Michael Zaremski : Okay, that's helpful. And yes, definitely it's been a great call. Lastly clearly, a lot of questions about the new commission structure. Maybe curious, has policy growth --is it more and more weighted towards maybe a disproportionately smaller percentage of agencies? Is that changed over the years? I know commission structure did change a number of years ago too, and it seems like it worked out okay, as sales didn't fall apart. Maybe you could add any color that'd be great. Tom Wilson : I mean, what our strategy is to have all of our agents growing and all of them be productive. As you point out, not all of them get there every year. Sometimes that's what we do in a local market or what the local market conditions. Some of that's what they do or they don't do. So we don't -- this commission change wasn't to address a problem. It was to seize an opportunity. And I think commission is -- we move commissions around frequently, like it's not -- it happens all the time, people do it now all the businesses are in and our goal is to make sure that their objectives are aligned with our objectives. Thank you all for -- let me just close by saying thank you. We had a good 2019. We're focused on transformers growth in 2020. And we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.

And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mark Nogal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Nogal : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and welcome, everyone, to Allstate's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session.  Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted today's presentation, along with our reinsurance update on our website at allstateinvestors.com.  Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and further context on our response to the coronavirus pandemic. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements throughout Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2019 and other public documents for information on potential risks.  And now I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas Wilson : Good morning. Thank you for joining us from wherever you are sheltered in place. Let's jump right in with Allstate's response to the coronavirus pandemic on Slide 2. Allstate has been helping customers overcome catastrophes for 89 years, and we've learned to act decisively, quickly and put customers first. As a result, we've led the industry in helping customers. We created a Shelter-in-Place Payback program of more than $600 million. Special payment plans are being used for customers experiencing financial challenges. Auto insurance coverage was expanded to cover the use of personal vehicles to deliver food, medicine and other goods for commercial purposes. Allstate Identity Protection is being offered for free for the rest of the year to all U.S. residents, given the increased exposure to cybercrime.  Business continuity plans were executed. Virtual sales and support capabilities were expanded. We leveraged our digital innovations, such as QuickFoto Claim and Virtual Assist, to better protect our customers, employees and agents. Employees and Allstate agents moved to more than 95% working remotely, and we altered a number of business practices to support our agents and employees. At the same time, Allstate is financially strong with significant capital and liquidity. In February, we reduced our public equity holdings by $4 billion to reduce the amount of economic capital back in the investment portfolio. But this turned out to be good timing because it enabled us to reduce the impact of the market downturn in March. And as Mario will cover later, we will maintain our share repurchase program given the strong capital position. For our communities, the Allstate Foundation announced an additional $5 million. That's on top of the money we normally grant every year, which is substantial to help deal with the pandemic and double demand for Allstate employees' need. Move to Slide 3. Let's touch base with Allstate's strategy. As you know, our strategy has two components : increase personal Property-Liability market share and expand into other protection businesses. This 2-part strategy leads to our 5 annual operating priorities, which is shown on the right side of this page, and we made good progress around all five.  If you move to Slide 4, Allstate had strong operating and financial results in the first quarter. Total revenues of $10.1 billion declined 8.3% for the prior year quarter due to capital losses instead of capital gains in the prior year. If you exclude the impact of the realized capital losses, revenues increased 2%, driven by a 4.4% increase in Property-Liability insurance premiums, which you can see from the table.  Net income of $513 million declined to the prior year quarter's increased underwriting income, was more than offset by capital losses and charges for pension and postretirement benefits. Adjusted net income, shown in the middle of the table, was $1.1 billion in the quarter or $3.54 per diluted share, which was significantly above the prior year, reflecting lower catastrophe losses. Returns were excellent with adjusted net income return on equity improving to 18.2%.  Mario will now discuss the first quarter results in more detail. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everybody. Let's go to Slide 5 to discuss the strong performance of our Property-Liability segment. Starting with the chart on the left, policy and premium growth continued, with excellent recorded and underlying profitability. Underwriting income of $1.35 billion in the first quarter was $645 million higher than the prior year quarter with a combined ratio of 84.9.  The improvement to prior year was driven by several factors, including lower catastrophe losses, increased premiums earned and lower auto accident frequency from the decline in miles driven. Auto accident frequency was significantly lower in the quarter, with property damage gross frequency down 12% compared to the prior year quarter. For the month of March, property damage gross frequency declined 27% compared to the prior year, as miles driven dropped significantly, as states began implementing social distancing measures. These benefits were partially offset by increased severity and the Shelter-in-Place Payback expense.  The chart on the right shows our Property-Liability expense ratio over time and specifically highlights the $210 million Shelter-in-Place Payback expense we recorded in the first quarter, which increased the expense ratio by 2.4 points. Excluding this impact, the expense ratio improved by 1 point compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting continued progress on enhancing the customer value proposition, which is one of the key components of our Transformative Growth Plan.  Let's go to Slide 6, which highlights investment performance for the first quarter. As you'd expect, our first quarter investment portfolio results reflect the impact of the market volatility caused by the coronavirus. As shown in the table in the middle of the page, total return for the first quarter was a negative 2.4%, largely reflecting lower portfolio valuation. While the decline in treasury rates supported fixed income prices, the significant widening of credit spreads more than offset that benefit, and interest-bearing valuation decline reduced return by 1.9%. Lower equity valuations further decreased returns by another 1%.  The chart shows net investment income of $421 million in the quarter, which was $227 million lower than the prior year. We recorded a loss of $208 million for performance-based results in the first quarter, as shown in gray. As you may recall, the income on our limited partnership is typically booked on a 1-quarter lag. Performance-based income related to fourth quarter 2019 sponsored financial statement was $176 million. We also recorded write-downs of $137 million on 4 underperforming private equity investments. In a typical quarter, this is where our process would have ended. However, given market volatility and economic disruption, we also recognized declines in the value of limited partnership interest, where we had enough information to make informed estimates rather than solely relying on sponsored financial statement as of December 31. This included updating publicly traded investments held within limited partnership to their March 31 market pricing, which reduced investment income by $52 million.  We also did not recognize $195 million of unrealized valuation increases reported in sponsor's fourth quarter financial statements. The sum total of these 4 items generated the $208 million performance-based loss in Q1. Because these investments exhibit idiosyncratic risk and return, future gains and losses are uncertain. But we believe utilizing this approach in the quarter is a better indication of current value. Income from the market-based portfolio, shown in blue, was lower than the prior year quarter by $19 million, reflecting the impact of lower reinvestment rates. We expect this trend to continue to the extent reinvestment rates remain below average interest-bearing portfolio yield.  Let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss our portfolio positioning. We take a disciplined and proactive approach to managing the investment portfolio risk and return profile, and our positioning has mitigated the impact of the current crisis. As you can see in the chart on the left of the page, the portfolio is largely made up of high-quality fixed income securities with substantial liquidity. We extended the duration of our Property-Liability portfolio last year, which was -- which has supported both income and returns in the lower rate environment. We are conservatively positioned in sectors more susceptible to the pandemic and continue to monitor those exposures closely. To provide transparency into these exposures, we have enhanced our Form 10-Q disclosures.  We also have a 13% allocation to performance-based investments and public equity securities, down from 18% at year-end 2019, which backed long-dated liabilities and capital. As you can see in the chart at the bottom right, in February, we reduced our equity exposure by $4 billion, primarily through the sale of public equity securities with proceeds invested in high-quality fixed income. These trades were executed at an average price equivalent of 3,281 on the S&P 500 compared to the March month end level of 2,585. We continue to proactively employ a disciplined risk and return framework to the portfolio as economic conditions evolve.  Now let's turn to Slide 8 to review results for the Life, Benefits and Annuities segment. Allstate Life, shown on the left, generated adjusted net income of $80 million in the first quarter, an increase of $7 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by lower operating costs and expenses. Allstate Benefits' adjusted net income of $24 million in the first quarter was $7 million below the prior year quarter. The decline was due to higher operating costs and expenses, driven by increased investments in technology and higher DAC amortization. Allstate Annuities, shown on the bottom right, had an adjusted net loss of $139 million in the first quarter, primarily due to the performance-based investment results we discussed earlier.  Coronavirus claims did not appear to materially impact any of these businesses in the first quarter, though we continue to monitor developments closely.  Now let's turn to Slide 9 to talk about our Service Businesses. The Service Businesses continued to increase the number of customers protected with policy in-force growth of 35.4% to $113.7 million. This is largely due to the increase in Allstate Protection Plans. Revenues, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses, grew 18.2% to $454 million in the first quarter. Adjusted net income improved to $37 million in the first quarter, reflecting an increase of $26 million compared to the first quarter of 2019, driven by growth of Allstate Protection Plans and improved profitability at Allstate Roadside Services.  Slide 10 highlights Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. While the impact of the coronavirus drove financial market instability and led to a decline in shareholders' equity, Allstate's diversified business model, substantial earnings capacity and strong capital and liquidity enables us to manage effectively through this pandemic. We have $3.4 billion in parent company holding deployable assets and $8.8 billion of highly liquid securities saleable within 1 week. We continued to generate strong returns on capital with an adjusted net income return on equity of 18.2% as of the end of the first quarter while returning $670 million to common shareholders in the quarter through a combination of $511 million in share repurchases and $159 million in common stock dividends. We plan to continue share repurchases under our current $3 billion program, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.  And now I'll turn it over to Glenn to discuss the coronavirus impact on auto insurance and how we're leveraging data and insights to make decisions. Glenn Shapiro : Thanks, Mario, and good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 11, which looks at the potential impacts of coronavirus on auto insurance. Profit has been, and will be, impacted by a reduction in miles driven, which will lower overall loss costs. While this has been significant, it will decline over time as the economy begins to reopen, and there are several offsets.  First, the reduction of drivers on the road has increased driving speeds, which can lead to increased severity per claim. We'll also likely incur additional bad debt from some customers who have chosen to take extended payment terms. On a longer-term basis, if the global auto parts supply chain is disrupted or parts prices are raised by auto manufacturers, this could increase repair costs. The pandemic and economic slowdown will also impact growth. If loss costs continue to be below prior year, the lower required rate increases will limit average premium growth.  On the positive side, the Shelter-in-Place payment could have a favorable impact on retention. The impact on new business is unclear since reduced vehicle sales can lower new business, but economic conditions may increase shopping levels. And we've seen an increased customer interest in telematics, and we're well positioned with both Drivewise and Milewise, the latter of which charges customers' insurance by mile. Getting ahead of these trends will be important to grow profitably as we continue to manage profitability and competitive position on a market-by-market basis and will enable us to be precise in our responses.  Let's now move to Slide 12. As a customer of Arity, we have access not only to our data, but insights from a much broader data set, some of which is shown on this slide. Telematics-based pricing allows you to factor in things like how much someone drives, where they drive and how they drive. Our telematics products enable us to do that for individual customers, which when combined with a broader set of data, enables us to make better judgments market by market.  For example, based on 3.5 billion trips from February through April, the upper-left graph shows that miles driven declined sharply in mid-March and then began a slow increase since then. You can also see that those states that had stay-at-home orders had a bigger decline in driving. In the upper right, you can see there's also a difference between rural areas at the top of the chart, which declined by about 20%, and urban areas at the bottom, which declined by about 50%. The bottom-left graph shows that while some drivers are not driving at all, those are the bars to the left, about 20% of drivers are actually driving more than they did before mid-March. Arity also provides a Drivesight score, which is a measure of driving risk. The lower the score, the higher the risk. As you can see on the bottom right, the mean risk has increased despite fewer cars on the road, which correlates to the data that shows some drivers are driving faster. The net of all of this is that Allstate has the data and business processes to proactively adjust to a changing operating environment.  I'll now pass it back to Tom. Thomas Wilson : Thank you, Glenn. To move to Slide 13, we want to discuss how we've moved past the emergency of moving people to work from home to the immediate of creating a Shelter-in-Place Payback to implementing intermediate-term actions. In this type of environment, you obviously have to look where you step, but you also have to decide where you want to walk. And as we look into the future, there's not that much clarity, right? Who will move back into offices? Will as many people still need to commute to work? What happens to the investment market? And of course, the answer is nobody knows. There are so many possibilities you can get frozen into inaction. So we used scenario planning to see what the future path look like under alternative assumptions.  This came out of Royal Dutch Shell in the '70s, and it works kind of like this. You find 2 things that will be the primary drivers of change. In this case, we selected the length and depth of the health crisis, which is shown at the top of the box on the bottom of that page, and the severity of the economic downturn from disruptive to severe, which is shown on the vertical axis. You then create 4 scenarios to represent a range of possible outcomes. As you can see from the slide, the best case in the upper right, we've labeled sigh of relief. The health care crisis is over relatively quickly and the economy is disrupted, but government support enables us to bounce back with them. In the worst case, in the lower right, is distracted by the virus. It reflects a significant health impact with repeated lockdowns over the next couple of years. The decline in GDP is greater than the Great Depression, but it doesn't last as long because of the government fiscal monetary action. For each scenario then, we look at a range of outcomes, including consumer behavior, auto insurance accidents and investment returns. This helps us decide what actions we should do, even though we do not know what the ultimate outcome will be. It also helps inform what not to do. And it enables us to establish road signs for each scenario, which improves our ability to forecast the direction we're headed. There are, of course, similar consequences in the scenarios, which help determine what actions to take, which is shown on Slide 14. In many of the outcomes, revenue growth is constrained because of fewer auto accidents, deteriorating incomes, increased unemployment or lower interest rates. As a result, we are accelerating our Transformative Growth Plan, which will improve customer value with increased utilization of new technologies, lower costs in new auto insurance products. And as you know well, the investment markets will be more volatile in many of these scenarios.  As a result, we're evaluating our strategic asset allocation. Many of us have found that we can adopt new technologies pretty quickly. Like who knew you can have so many Zoom or Teams or Skype meetings in one day? As a result, we're going to maintain a strong commitment to telematics and expanding the Integrated Digital Enterprise. Consumer behavior is also likely to change to focus on the quality and breadth of their protection. And this is where Allstate is headed, with the second part of our strategy, is to provide a broader array of protection offerings from auto insurance to include things like your phone and your identity.  Now we'll open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question on is -- I think is just on frequency. You guys provided some pretty good disclosure on the drop in miles driven, and I believe you said it started to bounce back from the COVID woes. So as we're thinking about Q2, so April and May kind of to date, how do you think about the frequency benefit that we might see over that period compared to what you saw towards the later stages of March? Thomas Wilson : Elyse, let me start, and then toss it over to Glenn. Well, it is -- obviously, as people start to drive more, they'll get in more accidents. So we expect that to head up. Where it will end up is hard to predict at this point because you don't really know when people are going to go back to the office and how many people will even go back to the office site.  As I talk to other companies, it's pretty clear to me that we found that we've built the infrastructure to do remote workforce. At Allstate, we've already had about 15% of our people remote before this. We think we can probably do more. So that would obviously lead to fewer people driving to and from work, but it's hard to predict exactly where the number comes out. Glenn, do you have anything you want to add to that? Glenn Shapiro : Not too much. I think, Tom -- as Tom said, you've got some unknowns in there, which would include, if you go on the other side of it, some pent-up demand. If you think about people who postponed trips, who postponed visiting relatives and want to catch up on it, so you could have some sort of fits and starts with some of the long-lasting, as Tom described, downward pressure on driving and, therefore, frequency, but also some potential short-term bubbles where people want to get out there because they're a little bit stir-crazy. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question is on buybacks. I know you guys have said you expect to maintain your buyback program. So as we think about the completion of that program, I believe it runs through the end of 2021, should we think about kind of an even pace of buybacks from here? Would there be some slowdown over the next couple of quarters? Or just given the capital position, you kind of expect that to be evenly maintained as we work our way through 2021? Thomas Wilson : Mario, will you take that question? Mario Rizzo : Sure. Elyse, thanks for the questions. So I think the place I'd start, Elyse, is we feel really good about our capital and liquidity position, $3.4 billion of holding company assets, $8.8 billion of readily available liquidity, $3.7 billion of dividend capacity out of our insurance companies into the holding company for the year. And our businesses are performing really well. So I think I'd say we expect to complete the program by the end of next year just like our Board authorized. And we've got a lot of flexibility in terms of how we execute it, but we would expect to just continue to buy back shares over that time period. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Charles Peters : First question will be on the expense ratio, the underlying expense ratio improvement. Can you talk about what -- and you provided just a basic comment on it in your prepared remarks. Can you give us more color on that? And maybe talk about maybe how that fits with the sequential decline in Allstate Agency's LSPs? And is that part of your integrated services platform rollout? Thomas Wilson : Mario, why don't you take expenses? And Glenn, will you take the agent? Mario Rizzo : Yes, sure. So when you look at the expense ratio in the quarter, you saw a 1 point sequential decline year-over-year in the expense ratio. And first thing I'd say is, reducing our cost continues to be a core part of our transformative growth strategy. And when you kind of deconstruct where the improvement came from, it's about 50-50, not quite between acquisition costs and operating costs.  And obviously, those are two core parts of our cost structure, and we saw improvement in both. And we're going to continue to be focused on reducing those costs going forward to enhance our competitive position to still take growth and be a core part of transformative growth for us.  We're also going to continue to invest in the things we need to invest in for transformative growth, things like technology and marketing. But we're focused going forward on continuing to reduce costs over time. I'll turn it over to Glenn to talk a little bit about the agency part of it. Glenn Shapiro : Yes. Greg, thanks for the question. In terms of the LSP count and agent count, you hit on part of it in your question with integrated service. When you look at licensed sales professionals, and in spite of the word sales being the operative word there, they spend only about 40% of their time on sales, about 60% on service. That's been a historic number.  And one of the things we're committed to is taking a lot of the transactional work out, both through self-service capabilities as well as integrated service, over time, so that they're increasing that percentage of time they're selling and not having to do as much of that transactional work. So we'll probably see that change over time. And that's really part of our overall transformative growth work that we're doing.  And in terms of the agency count, we're really focused on growth and growing with quality in terms of the agency force. So coming into this year, I think everybody knew we changed compensation a little bit, where we moved variable compensation from renewal to new, part of it. And we also increased expectations for production on our agency force because we really want to grow with those agents that are looking to invest and grow in their business. Charles Peters : The next -- my follow-up question is on the investment portfolio. First of all, as an observer, I have to acknowledge the brilliance of your decision to sell the public equities in February. It's stunning. But as I look at the adjustments you made to the limited partnerships, do you think that this is a permanent change to your valuation approach on a quarterly basis? Or -- and I guess the other adjacent question was -- would be that in your adjustments to the first quarter results on LPs, did it include an assessment for all of the LPs or 100% of the portfolio? Or what percentage of the portfolio wasn't covered by your valuation reassessments? Thomas Wilson : Greg, thank you for the comment on equity. I just want to be clear. It was done on a risk and return basis. So we just looked at the capital up on it. We looked at the prospective outlook, and we decided that wasn't as good a return on those -- on the amount of capital we had to have up on equity. We obviously -- it was good timing, but it wasn't like we knew the market crash was coming. But it also shows the benefit of having business processes that are metric driven that you stick to them, whether that's the way you invest or what Glenn was talking about in terms of how our business processes and our metrics were for changing frequency by state and doing pricing by state. Mario, will you take the question on accounting on this performance-based investment? Mario Rizzo : Sure. So Greg, I guess where I'd start is, as we've said in the past, generally, we record performance-based income on a 1-quarter lag based on the partner financial statements as of the prior quarter end. So for example, in the first quarter, we would have relied on year-end partner financial statements. And that's typically how we would approach the accounting.  However, our accounting policy does require that when a material market event occurs, and we have information available to make informed estimates, that we need to take that information into account. And that's what we did this quarter. So we made the two adjustments, the -- marking the public equity holdings in some of the partnership holdings to March 31 levels, and then suppressing the increases in unrealized valuation on securities that were reflected in the year-end financial statement. We did that because that's part of the accounting policy because there was a material market event in the quarter. The other piece was the -- just our normal watchlist process where we go through every holding. And to the extent we believe we need to impair a holding, we do that. And that was worth $137 million in the quarter on four specific holdings. So absent another market disruption event, let's say, hopefully, we avoid one this quarter, we'll go back to what our typical process would be. But because there was this disruption event in the first quarter, our policy required that if we had additional information that we could make good estimates based on, we should do that. And that's exactly what we did. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Jon Newsome : I was hoping you could talk a little bit about or give us some color on where the acceleration will come in the Transformative Growth Plan. What will change? You mentioned you're thinking of accelerating it. Thomas Wilson : Thanks, Paul. Obviously, it's a multifaceted program, right? The idea is to increase customer access. And that was putting together the -- using the Esurance capabilities on direct under the Allstate brand to expand there. It's to reduce our cost structure, and it's to use technology to enable us to launch new products and lower our cost structure. So the -- Glenn can talk about the progress on Esurance and the Allstate brand, and that's been great. And we're headed down the path to have start operating under the Allstate brand on a direct basis this year. On the cost reduction, it will accelerate some of the stuff we do on cost reduction, and it will also accelerate some of the work we're doing on building new technologies, particularly as it looks things like Milewise and Drivewise. Before, when you sold insurance by the mile, we're, I think, one of the few large companies that do that. The people didn't really know what it's about today with Shelter-in-Place Payback from us or the actions of our competitors. People are paying attention now and saying, \"Oh, maybe I do want to pay by the mile.\" So we will push harder on the new product efforts as well.  Glenn, do you want to pick up the Esurance and Allstate brand part? And maybe talk as well about the Esurance growth in the first quarter since that may be on people's mind as it relates to transformative growth. Glenn Shapiro : Yes. So I'll start with the Esurance growth piece, and then I'll go into the -- what we're doing as far as the transformation. Because really transformative growth and the brand changes had nothing to do with the growth in the first quarter. It was actually a 3-part story. Esurance was having increased loss trends in the latter part of last year. We needed to take some pricing and underwriting actions. We did, which is good, because we've gotten the profitability in line as a result. But what typically happens with that is you take a little bit of a hit on your retention and your new business as that happens. And that was happening towards the very end of the year and into January.  Now once those prices have worked their way through, we actually reinvested some marketing. We were doing pretty well in February and early March when quoting kind of fell off the table in the middle of March. So you have these sort of 3 windows to like a slow start in January, some really nice momentum in February, early March, and then everything fell off the table there for a few weeks.  Fortunately, as we've seen from external indices, shopping has returned and is expected to actually accelerate going forward. So we've got some good optimism there as to how it moves forward in terms of Esurance growth.  In terms of transformative growth and where we're going, Jonathan Adkisson, who's the President of Esurance and took over now as our head of the direct business, has been working with both teams and bringing it together in such a way that we increase or improve our sales process under the Allstate brand. We improve our online quote flow. And so those are already in process and happening on a day-by-day basis. It's a continuous improvement effort. What is still to come is our pivot on branding and how we invest in marketing for the Allstate brand to go to market as both a direct and agency-driven brand as well as our work with online leads. Jon Newsome : Somewhat relatedly, could you talk a little bit about what happened with retention? Did it also have a kind of similar 3 different periods like the sales did during the quarter? Thomas Wilson : Glenn, will you take that? Glenn Shapiro : Sure. Retention, I would say no. Retention really -- there's no impact yet from coronavirus because it's kind of a lagging metric. It includes midterm cancellations that you're measuring at the point of when they would have renewed.  So to the extent that we see impact, whether favorable or unfavorable from coronavirus, I think we'll see that on a go-forward basis from a retention standpoint. We still are in a pretty good space from a retention standpoint. We're down year-over-year, but off of a fairly high watermark, still running 88% retention in auto and feel fairly good about where we are. And we continue to work hard to do well for our customers. I think our response to coronavirus and the multiple areas that we were very quick to respond for customers can and, hopefully should, help us from a retention standpoint, and it's something we continue to work at. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore. David Motemaden : Just a question for Tom on investments. And you mentioned -- just in terms of reducing the equity allocation during the quarter, you mentioned you looked at the return and the capital required and decided to reduce it. I guess are there -- I guess, how are you thinking about the allocation to equities and LPs at 13% of the portfolio going forward? Do you expect to do more of this? And maybe if you could help me understand how much capital that freed up by reducing the $4 billion worth of equities. Thomas Wilson : Okay, David. Thank you for the growth time question. I'll talk about the logic for the equity. John can then talk about the process we're looking at in terms of going forward, which you talked about at the end is -- which is really your question, where should you invest in this kind of environment? And the answer is we don't know, but we've got a pretty good process, going to figure out what we think is the best option.  First, the equities. A large portion of the equity portfolio back to payout annuities, which are long-dated liabilities, think of them like a pension plan. And so you don't want to be invested in fixed income for annuities that are going to pay out in 10, 20, 30 years. So that's appropriately at the liability match. And that's sort of a bottom. We don't want to move away from that matching because it would be bad long term economically. And you don't want to start to be picking when you trade in or out.  On the other hand, some of our equities just are capital that we use to support the business and that we are a little more flexible with. And we brought down the -- when we look at economic capital, which is amount of capital, we think we need to put up for risk. We thought we had -- it wasn't a good enough return for us. So that was why we reduced it, which is really related to sort of the equity portfolio of the overall entity, not specific asset liability matching.  As it relates to the amount of freed up capital, David, from a statutory capital standpoint, it obviously reduces your capital a little bit. But we're long capital as it is. And so we don't look at it as though we had to free up capital to buy shares back or anything like that. We just look at it pure economics. What's the right thing to do for shareholders on a long-term basis? And it did free up some economic capital, some statutory capital, but it doesn't really make a difference in the amount of capital we have available to either do share repurchases or buy something like that. John, do you want to spend a minute on what we're doing on the strategic asset allocation? John Dugenske : Yes. Thanks, Tom. And David, thank you for your question. As a regular matter of course, we take a disciplined approach to investing and thoroughly look at the -- managing both the risk and return trade-offs. We do that both directly in the investment department, but then that's highly integrated with the way we think about return and risk opportunities across the firm, as Tom had mentioned.  One of the key things that we do is, first, we have a -- what I believe to be a strong team of about 400 investment professionals and -- that are deeply experienced. And we are in a number of different markets and look at price action, fundamental, economic drivers, technical observations across those markets. We also bring in, on a regular basis, keen insight from people from the outside, whether that's from our dealer relationships, whether that's via specific consultants or economic research teams that we have subscriptions to and try and formulate, at any point in time, the best risk return trade-off for the portfolio, especially given the business lines that we're associated with. As Tom mentioned, if you -- candidly, if you go back a little more than a year ago, we started to see that the return per unit of risk, as we perceived it in the marketplace, was flattening out, and we became a little bit more concerned about whether investment markets offer the best opportunity. What transpired since then is that the Fed became pretty active last year, as we've all seen. We took that as an opportunity to add duration to the portfolio, which is paying benefits today. So it's tantamount to our desire to be proactive with our investment portfolio and integrate it to the rest of the firm.  As we moved into the end of this year, one of the things that we noticed is that there was a limit to what the central banks could do to continue to push on returns of growth assets or risky assets. We thought that what we had observed in 2019 is not much earnings growth, and there is a fair amount of multiple growth. And we just thought that, that was likely coming into the end. As Tom said, we really didn't predict that there's going to be an event. But the one thing we all recognize as an enterprise that if there was an event, we weren't really giving much compensation for that. So we incorporated this equity trade in February, albeit at very good levels. The way that we accomplish this on a daily -- on a regular basis and quarterly, we sit down in an investment group and we go through what we call a capital allocation process. And we spend 2, 3 days deeply looking at markets, and then we share that with the rest of the enterprise. David Motemaden : Got it. And if I could, just one follow-up. Just on the expense ratio, the 23.4 in the quarter. How should I think about that for the rest of the year, just given potential top line pressure, offset by what sounds like ramp-up of the transformative growth as the year progresses? Thomas Wilson : Mario, do you want to take that? Mario Rizzo : Sure. Again, what I'd say is I'd reiterate. Look, a core part of our strategy is to continue to look to take costs out of the system and the general downward view of our expense ratio to improve competitive position.  Having said that, you did say, you articulated a couple of the items that are going to cause some choppiness in that. Number one is the outlook on revenue, which there's uncertainty around that, but also, we're going to continue to make investments in things, like I said, technology and marketing. So I guess what I'd say is, look, our focus is still on reducing costs and driving the expense ratio down over time.  I'm not going to sit here today and give you an exact trajectory of what that's going to look like. But strategically, that continues to be a core part of what we're trying to do. Thomas Wilson : So what we try to do is manage it down, but not do it stupidly, right? So like, as Glenn mentioned, we have to reposition the Allstate brand to go even more aggressive into driving the direct growth. And that's going to cost some money. So we'll do what we think is economic for shareholders. And then we think if we do it on an upfront, it works out so we achieve our overall objective. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Jamminder Bhullar : So I had a couple of questions. First, maybe just on the auto business, if you could talk about competition as you're looking at the business through the rest of the year. Everyone's margins are actually obviously pretty strong. Do you see, at some point, companies start to adjust pricing based on sort of whatever the new normal is in terms of driving behavior? And have you seen any indication of companies getting a little bit looser on renewal terms recently? Thomas Wilson : Let me start, maybe talk about process, Jimmy, and Glenn can fill in some specific thoughts he has. So it's -- obviously, we did the Shelter-in-Place Payback, and everybody followed relatively quickly. That doesn't mean that we really only have the idea. It just means that everybody thought that with margins where they were, it was fair to give it back to customers or at least that was our view. And whether that people will continue to do that or not, it's hard to tell. What I do know is that because we have a business model which is run by market, by line, by coverage, with all kinds of data, both our telematics data, our own historical data, our claim data and the information we get from Arity, will be incredibly precise and surgical about the way we react. I can't speak to what other people do.  Glenn, is there anything in the competitive environment that is clearer today than -- and has been kind of murky, is I would say. But anything you would add to that? Glenn Shapiro : Yes. What I would say is we're clearly going to be in a very benign rate environment. That might be an understatement, and -- for some period of time. What I haven't seen is, in the competitive environment, anybody making a more durable or permanent change to their premiums, meaning a rate reduction that is over a permanent price filing for rate reduction. Because I think, like us, I'm sure others see that like this came on fast. Like I don't think anybody predicted that when we came into this year, we were going to have an event that would drive mileage down by 50% or whatever the numbers are by state. And it can go away fast, too.  So I think everybody's looking at this, I know we are, from the standpoint of how do we react in real time, make good decisions, doing the right thing by market with precision, as Tom said, with our customers in mind, but not do anything that we then have to rebound on. And it wouldn't be good for anybody to overplay it a hand and then have to go take rate increases afterwards. So I think what you're going to see is a very benign, flat rate environment as opposed to a negative one. Jamminder Bhullar : And then on the sales or top line growth environment in sort of the Services, Benefits or Life businesses, should we assume that because the COVID and sort of Shelter-in-Place, that you'll see a drop-off in sales in some of these businesses in the near term? Thomas Wilson : Let me have Don answer about the Services Business, particularly Allstate Protection plans, which, as you saw, is just continuing to grow incredibly rapidly. And I hate for that story to get lost amongst the coronavirus part. And then I would just -- I think I could summarize it to say, in Life, that we haven't had much growth there in the last couple of years, and we're really trying to still reboot that growth strategy. Don, do you want to... Dogan Civgin : Sure. So I think, obviously, each of the businesses are going to be impacted by different trends. Some of them will be driven by frequency such as our roadside business. Some will be driven by auto sales and kind of general economic conditions like a dealer services and so forth. So I think every business will be impacted by some different factors. Allstate Protection Plans, which has continued to have terrific growth, first, on a broader level, they've been growing for a number of quarters. So this is not unique to the first quarter of 2020. And so we've been really pleased with the overall growth and overall improvement in profitability that they've been able to exhibit.  Now when you look at the first quarter, you might look and say, \"Well, their -- most of their sales are through retail.\" And retail is suffering, which is maybe true in general, but you have to get a little bit more nuanced and look at the types of customers they have, the types of retailers we do business with and, to some extent, what's being purchased at retail right now.  So when you look at SquareTrade's kind of largest B2B customers, they tend to be the larger one-stop shops, where people have been going to shop more frequently since coronavirus hit because they want to get all of their purchases done with one stop if they can do so. Second, a lot of what's been purchased, as people have been adapting to the home environment, has been kind of getting home offices set up, to some extent, entertainment setup because they're going to be stuck in their houses for some period of time, which obviously come with the opportunity for extended warranties as well as the stimulus check impact which put funds in people's pockets to be able to then go out and spend. So when you look at what their particular type of customer was looking for, the first quarter after coronavirus saw a nice increase. It's hard to tell whether that will last and how long that will last. I think at some point, the overall trends in retail will be a headwind for Allstate Protection Plans. But at least in the short term, it's actually been a nice tailwind. I would also say that new business, which they've picked up a number of large accounts recently, both domestically and overseas, rollouts of those programs have slowed down a little bit as people have been trying to figure out how they're going to get those stores open. And there was a slight, I would say in the first quarter, benefit from claims dip as people submitted fewer claims after the virus hit for some period of time. So overall, trends continue to be really strong. Hard to tell what the impact is going to be on Allstate Protection Plans long term from the virus. But in kind of the immediate term, it's been good for their top line. Jamminder Bhullar : Okay. And just lastly, any comments you have on long-term strategy for the annuity block and the likelihood of a sale or reinsurance of that business? Thomas Wilson : Sure. Let me jump at that, Jimmy. First, on the -- I should also point out on more longitudinal perspective, Allstate Protection Plans now has over 100 million policies in force. Don, I think it was about 30-plus million when we bought it, right? 30 million plus. Dogan Civgin : Yes. Thomas Wilson : So it's had a tremendous run not to be swept under the carpet. It's really a great team. As it relates to annuities, it's a huge drag on our ROE because we -- as I mentioned earlier, we have a lot of equities behind that portfolio because we believe that's the right thing to do. So our 18.2% includes a large drag on it from the annuities. If we could find a way to eliminate that drag, we would do so. But we only want to do it with some place where our customers will be well taken care of because this is largely written on our paper. And we don't want to give somebody a whole bunch of investments and say, \"Good luck, and we hope you pay the people off when you get there.\" And they do something stupid.  So we are managing it well as it is today. Either we will find a solution, that could be a reinsurance solution, it could be a sale, it could be we just keep it, we run it differently. In any event, it will go away in terms of its drag on ROE when the new long-dated accounting -- long-dated annuity accounting comes in place where you'll have to mark that to market. We don't -- we think that, that accounting is a little rough. On the other end, it will eliminate the drag on overall ROE. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Charles Lederer : This is actually Charlie on for Mike. Can you talk about your commercial lines exposures outside of commercial auto? And specifically, can you talk about business interruption exposure in general, whether you've seen claims and if your policies have virus exclusions? Thomas Wilson : Don, in your report? Dogan Civgin : Okay. Charlie, so in our business insurance, we do actually have exclusions for disruption caused by the pandemic and so we -- like many others do. And so there's a lot of noise out there about implementing requirements for insurance companies to go back and provide coverages that were not only excluded explicitly, but were also not priced for.  And so we would be against obviously that. Having said that, our exposure is relatively small. There's about 60,000 policies in total that we have that sort of exposure, which as I said, is explicitly excluded. So it's a relatively small number for a company like Allstate. Charles Lederer : Got it. And then on the Shelter-in-Place Payback included in the expense ratio in the first quarter, does that imply the charge for the second quarter will be the balance to get to the $600 million you guys have talked about? And is there a potential for further premium reductions, either larger discounts per month or an extension of the duration of the discounts? Thomas Wilson : Mario, if you'll take the second -- the first piece and then make sure we talk about all the other things, whether it's bad debts or anything else coming up in the quarter. As it -- Charlie, as it relates to another Shelter-in-Place program, what we said is we're always going to treat our customers fairly. This came along quickly. We moved within 10 days to get people what was a relatively easier to implement in terms of it ubiquitous across the country, ubiquitous by customer. Everybody got 15% in April and May. And we felt we needed to do that because they were all struggling. The government money had not yet come into people's home. So we even provided the opportunity for them to get cash, even though they might have gone on a deferred payment plan with us.  And so that was -- it was done because we need -- knew our customers needed help, and we need to do it fast. If frequency were to stay down because of something that was not continuous, so we thought it was Shelter-in-Place for a longer period of time, those graphs that Glenn showed. If it stayed down there, we may want to do something else for our customers to reflect the fact that they're not driving as much. This time though, it will be much more precise. And so we'll use all the data we have to -- as Glenn talked about, some people are driving more, but it doesn't feel like they should get a Shelter-in-Place Payback, right? It doesn't seem as fair to somebody who's not driving their car at all. The same thing about which area you live in, you live in an urban area or rural area. Is your -- what kind of driving? Are you a really fast driver? Now not everybody's on telematics, so we can't get it as precise as we would like. But we are working on a more comprehensive approach should frequency stay down, and we will do what we think is fair for our customers. Mario, do you want to take the second quarter impact from what we've already done? Mario Rizzo : Sure. So on -- with respect to the SIPP payment, we saw we recorded a portion of it in the first quarter. The balance will be recorded in the second quarter. So that one's pretty straightforward. That will happen. When we kind of decided on the SIPP payment, one of the things we explicitly factored in was the potential for bad debt expense associated with the special payment plan that we're allowing our customers to opt into. As we evaluated the number of customers that had opted into that as of the end of March, along with our historical bad debt experience, the impact in the first quarter from a bad debt perspective was pretty immaterial. Obviously, we will look at the number of customers that have signed up as well as the exposure going forward. And we'll take that into account in the second quarter in terms of establishing bad debt prospectively. But first quarter was reasonably immaterial. Second quarter, we'll take a look at the analysis. We'll update it appropriately, and then we'll record something incremental in the second quarter. Operator : Our final question then for today comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : Just want to go back to distribution a little bit. Can you maybe talk about how the agency channel is impacted by Shelter-in-Place environment and the -- with customers potentially looking for lower price options as well? And with that, maybe also touch on kind of the timing of shifting the agent variable compensation to a -- more to a new business generation and how that has been impacting the sales force. Thomas Wilson : Glenn will be the best person to answer that question. Glenn Shapiro : All right. Thanks, Yaron. First of all, when you think about the impacts of coronavirus, I think it's important, there's all different types of businesses that have to close down all the way up through businesses that actually benefit because they're in the type of business that wins in this type of new environment. The agents kind of fall in the middle of that because if you think about their revenue stream, it is still significantly renewal compensation. Our total compensation to the agency force, and if you break down to any individual agent, will range somewhere between 90% and 100% or, in some cases, even above 100%. Some are growing more post middle of March versus before. So the core of their income remains. So you've got that piece.  In terms of how it impacts their business, I think that, that will be something to watch and something to see. I agree that people will be looking for value as they go forward. But I also think our agents have really been able to show their value in this process. I don't think there's another time in our company history where I could make the following statement. Over the course of the last 6 weeks, almost all of our agents have called almost all of their customers. So you've got this really unique period of time where, a, people are more available to be reached; b, they have more questions, and they really want to hear from their trusted adviser; and c, our folks are just committed to that because of a national crisis.  And so I think that there's this moment in time where at least some portion of our customer base will really see the value of what they've gotten out of their agency relationship and having a trusted adviser. That said, everything Mario and Tom and others have talked about on this call about transformative growth is, we've got to keep taking costs out of our system and be a more affordable and more competitive value for consumers going forward, which is why we're accelerating the Transformative Growth Plan. Yaron Kinar : Got it and understood. And then maybe one quick follow-up. Milewise, you talked about potentially accelerating it. I think as of year-end, you were in 14 states. Any thoughts as to how quickly you can really expand the program to all 50 states? Thomas Wilson : Glenn, do you want to give an update on that? Glenn Shapiro : Yes. So we're in 16 states and moving as quickly as we can on it. Certainly, the pandemic has shown a light on the value of a pay-per-mile product, and we're seeing a nice uptick in the demand for it. You see kind of 2 effects in the public right now. One is just the acceptance of the notion that telematics is going up as a result of all of this, and two is actually the over-demand for something like Milewise is going up. We have some states up 30% in terms of their sales since the middle of March and seeing double-digit percentages regularly on a week-by-week basis of the new business being sold in Milewise versus other products. So we think it's a great opportunity. It will absolutely be part of our filings that we're doing broadly across the country to try to expand and do more for consumers as a result of the pandemic. Thomas Wilson : Okay. Thank you all. Allstate is in a strong position. We know how to protect our customers from life's uncertainties, and we'll continue to do that as we navigate through this crisis. So thank you for participating, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mark Nogal, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Nogal : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome, everyone, to Allstate's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. After prepared remarks, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted today's presentation along with our reinsurance update on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and further context on our strategy to grow personal property-liability market share. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2019 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Good morning. Thank you for joining us this day on Allstate. So let's start on slide 2 of its Allstate's strategy and our second quarter highlights. So our purpose is to protect people from life's uncertainties and to be a positive personal good. And as you know, our strategy has two components : increase personal proper liability and market share and expand into other protection businesses, which are shown in those two ovals. Richest Allstate brands, customers and capabilities to both of those components. This strategy is an adaption the coronavirus pandemic led to excellent operating in the second quarter, as shown on the right hand. The enterprise customer experience score increased as employees and agencies did an excellent job of working remote, and we benefited from leading on the shelter-in-place payback and helping customers in other ways. Profitability was good with adjusted net income of $2.46 per share. We also made progress at our multiyear transformative growth plan by leveraging the direct sales capabilities of Esurance and lowering expenses. Allstate Protection Plans, which, as you know, we acquired 3.5 years ago for $1.4 billion and high-growth and high returns, section plans [Technical Difficulty] at the end of 2017 and estimated adjusted net income of $35 million in the quarter and $69 million for the first six months of 2020. The performance-based core losses in the quarter reduced reported net investment income despite solid total loan growth. Our profitable growth it depends overall [Technical Difficulty]. We move to slide 3. I'll say quickly excellent operating results, total revenues of $11.2 billion increased 0.5% of the prior year for gain and growth in the property-liability premium earned were -- that more than offset the decline in investment income for performance-based losses. Net income of $1.2 billion increased 49% to the prior year quarter, as you can see from the middle of the table market value in just $380 million 2019, $2.46 per share, 12.8% of other than repurchase program. With adjusted net income mature line at 17.8%. [Technical Difficulty] Glenn Shapiro : Thanks, Tom. Let's go to slide 4, where we'll discuss the strong performance of our Property-Liability segment. Premium and policy growth continued with excellent recorded and underlying profitability. Policies in force were $33.8 million at the end of the quarter, and Allstate brand policies reaching an all-time high for auto at $20.5 million. Underwriting income of $904 million increased by $537 million compared to the prior year quarter. The chart on the lower left shows the second quarter combined ratio of 89.8% and the impacts driving the 6-point improvement over the prior year quarter. Starting on the left the underlying loss ratio improved by 15.9 points on lower auto insurance losses from fewer accidents, due to significant reduction in miles driven. The underlying loss ratio on homeowners insurance also improved due to increased premiums and lower non-catastrophe losses. The underlying loss ratio improvements were partially offset by Allstate's efforts to help customers during the pandemic. This included the 15% shelter in place payback on auto, which totaled 8.3% of premiums across all lines of on business, plus a 0.5% of premiums from increased bad debt expense, due to billing flexibility related to the Allstate special payment plan. The chart on the right breaks down the expense ratio components. The expense ratio was 23.0 and improved 0.5 point compared to the prior year quarter, excluding the $738 million shelter-in-place payback and bad debt expenses in the quarter. As you know, one portion of our transformative growth plan is to deliver better value to customers, in part by reducing operating expenses. While expenses vary by quarter, as you can see from this quarter, the long-term trend has been down as you look at the adjusted numbers, which are 2.1 points below 2018 expense ration. So let's now move to slide 5 and discuss transformative growth in more detail. The transformative growth plan will accelerate growth through three key levers : expanding customer access, enhancing customer value and investing in technology and marketing. We're expanding customer access and increasing product availability by leveraging Esurance's direct sales capabilities under the Allstate brand. The Esurance brand will be sunset over time, and the advertising spend will be concentrated on the Allstate brand. This also includes improving online and call center sales flows. We're enhancing customer value through continued cost structure improvements, which will make prices more competitive without reducing underwriting margins. We recently announced changes in the personal Property-Liability organization, which included combining our direct operations as well as consolidating Allstate brand field operations to further lower costs. To improve customer value, we're also expanding telematics offerings and promoting our unique Milewise pay-by-mile product, which is appealing to customers right now as they're driving less during the pandemic. The third component is investing in technology and marketing. Technology investments are improving our customer experience, including the recent launch of Allstate One app that simplifies and combines digital access and telematics offerings in one place. Launching the transformative growth plan also enhances our ability to adapt to a post coronavirus operating environment. We'll have lower cost structure and more competitive prices. We're also building the capacity to invest in new products, marketing and technology while maintaining strong margins. The new technology platform will allow us to be more connected with customers and give us greater flexibility to change products and processes going forward. Now, I'll turn it over to Mario to discuss the rest of our second quarter results. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Glenn. Let's go to slide 6, which highlights investment performance for the second quarter. We take a proactive and holistic approach to managing the investment portfolio. After reducing public equity in the first quarter, we increased our allocation to investment-grade corporate bonds this quarter. The chart at the left shows net investment income totaled $409 million in the quarter, which was $533 million below prior year, due to a decline in market-based income and losses in the performance-based portfolio. Market-based income, shown in blue, was below the prior year quarter by $77 million. As interest rates have declined, reinvestment rates are below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield, reducing portfolio income. We recorded $211 million loss on our performance-based investments in the second quarter, as shown in gray. As you know, we proactively adjusted valuations in the first quarter in response to the significant decline in equity markets. In the second quarter, we followed our standard process for recording performance-based results, which generally recognizes valuations on a one-quarter lag. Given this lag in income recognition, the second quarter improvement in public equity markets did not have a positive impact on this portfolio in the quarter. GAAP total returns are shown in the table on the right. The second quarter return of 5% primarily reflects tighter credit spreads and the impact of higher equity valuations on the $2.8 billion public equity portfolio. Year-to-date returns were 2.7% and the latest 12 months was 5.9%. Performance-based investments had a 2.4% and 4.5% loss for the quarter and first half of 2020, respectively. These investments are expected to generate higher returns than the market-based portfolio, and consequently, typically have higher volatility. This portfolio has generated an annualized rate of return of 7.4% over the past five years, as shown in the bottom right of the table. Let's move to slide seven and review results for Allstate Life, Benefits, and Annuities. Allstate Life, shown on the left, generated adjusted net income of $72 million in the second quarter, an increase of $4 million compared to the prior year quarter. Life insurance mortality was elevated in the second quarter, driven by $25 million in identified coronavirus death claims. Excluding these claims, mortality experience was favorable relative to expected levels. Despite higher mortality from the pandemic, Allstate Life generated attractive returns as lower operating expenses supported an increase in adjusted net income for the second quarter. Allstate Benefits premiums declined 7.4% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting the non-renewal of a large underperforming account in the fourth quarter of 2019, lower sales from increased competition, and the economic impact of the coronavirus, including higher employee turnover, business closures, and furloughs. Allstate Benefits adjusted net income of $5 million in the second quarter was $32 million below the prior year quarter, reflecting a $32 million after-tax write-off for software associated with the billing system. We are developing a technology strategy to build an end-to-end digital platform over time that modernizes more than just our billing system and enables us to maintain our strong position in the voluntary Benefits marketplace. Allstate Annuities, shown in the bottom right, had an adjusted net loss of $111 million in the second quarter, primarily due to the lower performance-based investment results that I discussed earlier. Let's turn to slide eight to discuss the results of the Service Businesses. Service Businesses revenue, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses, grew 15.4% to $457 million in the second quarter. Policies in force continued to grow, increasing 41.2% and to $127.3 million in the second quarter, largely due to growth in Allstate Protection Plans. Allstate Identity Protection policies in force increased $1.1 million from the prior year quarter to $2.3 million and includes subscribers accepting our free service offer through the remainder of the year as a result of the pandemic. Adjusted net income improved to $38 million in the second quarter of 2020, reflecting an increase of $22 million compared to the second quarter of last year, driven by growth of Allstate Protection Plans and improved profitability at Allstate Roadside Services. Allstate Protection Plans has outperformed expectations across each acquisition measure of success established following the $1.4 billion acquisition in 2017. Those measures of success include rapidly growing new and existing domestic customers, raising profitability and returns on capital deployed, and creating sustainable growth beyond U.S. retail. As you can see in the chart on the right, Allstate Protection Plans has grown rapidly. Policies in force increased fourfold over the last three and a half years from less than 30 million policies in 2017 to more than $120 million in the second quarter of 2020, representing a compound annual growth rate of 53%. This growth trajectory reflects expansion within both the U.S. and international markets. Allstate Protection Plans also began generating positive adjusted net income in the first quarter of 2018 and continues to experience upward trajectory with added scale, generating $35 million of adjusted net income in the second quarter of 2020 and $96 million over the latest 12 months. As you can see, Allstate Protection Plans has consistently grown customers, revenue, and profits since the acquisition. Slide nine highlights Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate's capital position remains strong, due to our diversified business model, substantial earnings capacity and proactive capital management. We continue to generate strong returns on capital with an adjusted net income return on equity of 17.9% as of the end of the second quarter. We returned $563 million to common shareholders in the second quarter through a combination of $391 million in share repurchases and $172 million in common stock dividends. Over the last year, we have repurchased 5.2% of outstanding shares as you can see from the table. And as of June 30, there was $2.4 billion remaining on the $3 billion share repurchase authorization that is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. Book value per share of $79.21 was 17.7% higher than the second quarter of 2019, reflecting strong net income and an increase in fixed income unrealized capital gains, partially offset by cash return to shareholders. Allstate's stock valuation metrics, however, have not kept pace with this continued strength and strong operating performance. Moving to Slide 10. This quarter, we also entered into an agreement to acquire National General. This acquisition is financially attractive and will create a platform to drive profitable growth in the independent agent channel. National General will become Allstate's independent agent platform. We will essentially do a reverse merger of our Encompass and Allstate independent agent businesses into National General, which has a good technology platform, broad distribution and a management team that has substantial acquisition integration experience. The deal will increase Allstate's total personalized market share by over one point and create a top five competitor in the independent agent channel personal lines market. It also generates opportunities for growth and expense efficiencies. It gives us a strong presence in higher risk, nonstandard auto insurance, Allstate's expertise in standard auto and home insurance will be used to leverage national General's independent agent relationships by broadening the product offering. The acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings and returns in the first year. We expect high single-digit earnings accretion in the first year post close, and adjusted net income return on equity is expected to increase by about 100 basis points. These impacts anticipate cost synergies but do not include the incremental revenue growth opportunity. The transaction will have no impact on Allstate's existing share repurchase program. The second quarter was a busy one, where we continued to address the impact of the pandemic earned good returns for shareholders and position Allstate for long-term profitable growth. With that context, let's open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Yaron Kinar : Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. So my first question is just looking at the expense ratio, adjusted for bad debt and the payback improving by 50 basis points, maybe a little more with \u2013 when you adjust for the ad spend. How much of that is from the transformative growth program? And how much is just simply COVID-driven? Tom Wilson : Yaron? Yaron Kinar : Yes. Can you hear me? Tom Wilson : Yes. Yaron Kinar : So Tom, I think we're having difficulties hearing you. I was able to hear Mario and the others on the call, but I've not been able to really hear you. I'm not sure if there's somebody on the line \u2013 if my line is open. I can't hear. Glenn Shapiro : Your line is open. His line is definitely \u2013 the phone is definitely not coming through clearly. Don Civgin : Mario, do you want to jump in on that one? Mark Nogal : Why don't we have this? And then let's \u2013 Tom, maybe if you could dial back in. Go ahead, Mario. Mario Rizzo : Oh, you want me \u2013 okay. Thanks, Yaron. So, I guess, what I'd say is, as we've talked about transformative growth, I'll just remind you, there's three core elements, as Glenn talked about. There's expanding customer access, enhancing the customer value proposition and continuing to invest in technology and marketing to support the broader transformative growth program. And improving our cost structure is a key part of how we're going to achieve that second objective of enhancing customer value. We continue to make really good progress on this front. Our underwriting expense ratio, as you indicated, is down 0.5 point once you adjust out the coronavirus impacts to 23 in the quarter, and it's down eight-tenths of a point compared to last year. And when you look at where the improvement came from, it's in acquisition-related expenses and operating costs. And that's an area that, as we've talked about, those are two of the areas that we're obviously focused on taking cost out. So we've been at this now for over a year. And I'd say our cost reductions, again, are a core part of transformative growth. So I'd say that's really what we're focused on doing as part of the plan. And we're \u2013 we would expect to continue to take costs out over time. And we'll continue to look for ways to improve processes and enhance efficiency and through a variety of means that support the transformative growth program. Yaron Kinar : I guess, what I was trying to get at is, how much of the improvement this quarter is sticky? And how this quarter is just reduction in T&E and in office costs, given that we were in a shelter-in-place environment? Mario Rizzo : Yeah. And, I guess, what I'd say, Yaron, is we're going to look to continue to drive cost out of the system. So I don't think \u2013 the expense ratio may bounce around a little bit going forward, as we invest in technology. You saw us \u2013 we invested more in marketing in the quarter. But I guess the way we're thinking about it is, our intent is to drive the expense ratio down over time, and that's what we're going to do. Yaron Kinar : Okay. My second question, I think in the past, you've said that you're not looking to cut rates, but we are seeing some of your competitors starting to cut more meaningfully here. Favorable frequency experience probably also helps. Are you holding to your decision? Glenn Shapiro : Yes. So I'll jump in and take that one. This is Glenn, but thanks for the question, Yaron. I think, first of all, we're seeing \u2013 there's one competitor that took some meaningful action more broadly. I don't think we're seeing a huge rush in direction, for one. Our competitors have been aggressive. And it's a competitive environment, but not irrational. And the second point I'd make is we manage this on a local level. And I know I'm a broken record, I say this every quarter when we talk about how we manage the \u2013 both the margins and our pricing. Over the course of the last 60 days, this could look like, with our flat rate environment, that our product people have just sort of been hanging around and waiting for something. We've actually made 180 filings over the last over the last two months. And what we do is we're constantly, in each state and each market, looking at how we pull and push levers to be competitive in the environment. It's why we saw sequential growth. And we've continued to grow in spite of a tough environment. And those filings were things like, making new business more competitive, making our telematics offering more competitive with some incentives in that area and across all 50 states, pulling different levers like that. So I would say that, while we don't favor, as you said, sort of a broad base like we're just going to cut X amount everywhere. We do favor being very surgical, very detailed and very thoughtful about how we manage our competitive position and our margin in each market. And I think you know from over time that we react quickly, whether it was the frequency spike back in 2015, or it's the frequency decline now of 2020 that we move really quickly on these things, and we have a very responsive system. And we react market-by-market and make sure that we return a very good return to our shareholders. But at the same time, we stay competitive and we're able to grow profitably. Yaron Kinar : Thank you and best of luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question please. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Thank you. Given the strong results that you've been seeing, obviously, pretty favorable frequency results in the quarter, are there any plans for further rebates within your auto insurance book? Glenn Shapiro : So, this is Glenn. Thanks, Elyse. I'll take that as well. I think what we're looking at now, and as I mentioned in the last question to Yaron, we're looking at sustainable and more sophisticated instruments. We're looking at how we get competitive with those as opposed to what I think was the right decision and a good way to go about it with the shelter-in-place payback at the moment. It needed a broad and blunt instrument because of the big move in frequency at that time. But when you wrap-in frequency and then the mix shift that moves severity and the expansion of coverage, the increase of bad debt because we get more flexible for customers in need, put all of those things together, I think the go-forward approach is going to be more in the lines of allowing our losses to flow into our rating as we always do, and to be more precise on a state-by-state and market-by-market basis versus a broad shelter-in-place payback. Things could change because depending on how the frequency and how the virus moves and all of that, but our thinking right now is to be more -- look at more sustainable tools than a shelter-in-place payback going forward. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question, could you give us a sense of how frequency and severity trends have trended in July versus what you saw in the second quarter as we kind of -- as folks that started to go back to work and, et cetera, we've seen a change in loss trends? Mario Rizzo : This is Mario. Glenn, can talk about the second quarter, but we're not going to talk about July trends at this point. Glenn Shapiro : Yeah. So I'll talk about the second quarter a little bit and to say, first of all, thanks for mentioning frequency and severity because they do tend to move in opposite directions with one another. And one thing, I'll just proactively address is that I know some of our competitors report a recorded number on severity. We report a paid number and paid calendar quarter is, I think, a more transparent and better metric to use in normal times, but we're in anything but normal times. So it's much, much more volatile and subject to mix shifts. So you'll see the number move more just because of the mix of what's being paid inside the quarter where you have fewer short-tail, small claims being paid in the period and everything, so that you'll see the two things move a little bit opposite one another. But what we saw throughout the quarter, and we did disclose that June was less of a difference in gross severity -- frequency, excuse me, than the other months in the quarter -- is that it has come down. It's starting to normalize in some places. There's a lot more variation by state early on like what we would see in April and May is that while there was some variation, pretty much all the states were down within a relatively close tolerance to one another. That has started to diverge more with a really rural state like Montana, for example, was actually up slightly in the year-over-year. And then you've got places that are more significantly down, particularly states that are more heavily concentrated with metro areas and that have had more spikes of the virus. So we're watching things on a very local level into how they're moving. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Greg Peters : Good morning. I'm going to pivot and I'd like to get an update on your homeowners business. I was looking at some of the statistics that you provide, like on page 17 of your supplement. And I was struck by the improvements in frequency, both gross claim and paid claim frequency, not just in the first and second quarters of this year, but it seems to be a longer term trend. And I would be curious about your impressions about what's driving that and how we should think about those trends as we look beyond just this year and think about next year. Don Civgin : Greg, it's Don Civgin. I'll ask Glenn to answer it in more detail. And we've obviously worked hard on our homeowners business over the last number of years, and so we're pleased with the returns we're getting from that business. But Glenn, do you want to get into more specifics? Glenn Shapiro : Yes. Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Don. So yes, as Don said, I'm always -- I always preach that -- look at the long term and look at the reported combined on home. We've got year-to-date and 88.6% combined ratio recorded. Our 12 months is 83%, and our 5-year is 87%. So we've sustained that. I think, Greg, your point on the frequency is a tough one because it changes almost every quarter because the weather drives so much of it. So you'll have more caught up in catastrophes, and so it's sort of a lower underlying frequency, and then you'll have maybe a good weather quarter and you have few weather-driven and fewer cats. They move around a lot. What I would say recently, and this is probably an underreported part of the COVID impact, is that we've seen a shift in frequency severity on the home side because -- and it's pretty logical is we're seeing fewer like death claims and break-ins because everybody's home. And those tend to be lower severity claims, and yet we're seeing about the same number of fire points, and those tend to be higher severity claims. So we saw our frequency go down in the quarter. Our severity average go up because the ones that went away were smaller claims. And so we get into the details, and we look at all of those components, but I wouldn't necessarily draw a conclusion that there's something in home driving long-term frequency down that will be sustainable. I think it's been different factors each quarter. Greg Peters : Got it. Thanks for that answer. And then I guess I'll circle back your transformative growth plan and the integrated services platform. And as you guys know, I always like to track your agency data that you provide on page 9 of your supplement. And so I was wondering if you could just, from a big picture perspective, we're watching some directional changes in some of the numbers, whether it's a slight decrease in total Allstate agencies and LSPs, but we're also seeing an increase in the independent agencies and Encompass independent agencies, can you walk us through what your view is on how that's going to change further as we continue to roll out these plans that you've mentioned previously? Mario Rizzo : Yes. Glenn, why don't you go ahead? Glenn Shapiro : Okay, great. So you're always into the detail, Greg. So you definitely picked up on the right trends there. We're focused on growing with agencies looking to invest, and this ties back to something Mario talked about the expenses. It's not that our acquisition costs have gone down because we don't want to grow and we don't want to invest in agents looking to grow. They've gone down because we've moved the money really in a way that incentivizes growth and it's more efficient to do it that way. So coming into this year, we moved some money that was incentivizing retention, and we moved it to incentivize new business. And -- or I should say renewal versus new business as opposed to retention because how it gets paid. That's one change. And that changed some agents, who wanted to invest in that way, and some that didn't and perhaps voted themselves out on that one. We also increased our baseline performance requirements for, I'll call it, our lowest producing agency and required that folks sort of be more open for business than they have been. And so that has driven the number down a little bit. And the other thing is integrated service, which you mentioned in the question. That number will start to look strange over time. We have about 500 agents in there right now. So those agents won't show staff members that are being augmented or provided by Allstate. And so it kind of moves the number to a different place because we don't report it in as part of the agency staff as licensed sales professionals because we're doing the work on the back end for them in those centers. So there's a number of pieces moving it. But I think the headline to take away is that we've grown in the agency plan. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we've all-time high in Allstate brand auto policies in force. So the agency force has grown, and we want to grow in all of our lines. We want to grow all state agents. We want to grow our independent agent channel, which is the pending acquisition that we've got with National general, and we want to grow in direct, which is the combination of Esurance and Allstate Direct. Tom Wilson : Hey, Greg, this is Tom Wilson. I'm \u2013 hopefully, I've reconnected. Mark Nogal : We can hear you. Tom Wilson : All right. Let me highlight what Glenn just said. So, transformative growth, so we're going to sell as much as we can through everybody as we can. So we want to have more Allstate agents. We want to have independent agents. We want to sell more. You will see, over time, some increases decreases and how much goes through each of those channels as we transition to or a profit model. So \u2013 and Glenn explained what we're doing on new business versus a retention. But we're really working on different ways we can get to customers. We may not need as much real estate in the future as we have today. That means local offices are different. So you'll see changes, and you're seeing some of that change now because we're not new Allstate agents at this point as we build out these new models. So it's really about very distribution force. Greg Peters : Got it. Thank you for the answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your question please. Mike Zaremski : Hey, good morning. Thanks. Could you guys \u2013 and maybe I missed it, did you guys touch on auto severity? I think, we \u2013 investors have expected it to increase during COVID. Maybe you can discuss whether we should expect the severity or you could talk about it, so we can maybe better understand whether it should continue? And I'm curious whether, like, the underlying severity trend is still kind of higher for longer due to issues we talked about pre-COVID? Or is there a change to that potentially post-COVID? Tom Wilson : Mike, let me have Glenn answer that, but give you an overview first. In a time like this, where the numbers are changing rapidly in terms of the number of claims, they \u2013 the statistics in the method you use for any individual component of loss costs bounce around a lot. So it's \u2013 the best thing to do is to look at overall loss costs and say, are your loss costs still the right percentage of your premiums? We obviously have done attribution on severity, and Glenn can talk about that. Glenn Shapiro : Yeah. So it's a great question because, as Tom said, I mean, they do bounce around a lot. Overall, we feel very comfortable and confident with where we are on severity. PD severity, paid severity was reported at 20% up, which number jumps off the page. Let me give you just an example of why that is on a paid severity number like that. So paid severity is \u2013 as you'd expect, it's a number of claims you settled and closed during that calendar period divided by the total number of claims, and you get your average. Well, during the second quarter, we settled just as many six-month-old claims as we would in any normal quarter, because six months earlier, there was no COVID and there was no drop in frequency. We settled just as many five-month-old claims and four-month old-claims and three-month-old claims, but we settled a lot fewer three-day-old claims. And one-week-old claims, because they just weren't there. They weren't happening with the same frequency and as you'd expect, the claims you settle in three, four and five days are lower severity on average. They're quick. They're easy, and they're low cost. The ones that are six months are typically ones that have like they've gone through their own carrier. The segregation comes over from that carrier, they average a much higher severity type of claim, or they've been a total loss, and so they take longer to process and so on. So it's just a pure mix issue that drives that type of number. When we get down underneath that, and we're able to look at the things that come in, in the quarter and how they're resolving and are estimating practices and what the true severity looks like, it feels like normal inflation that we've seen in the single digits that we're very comfortable with. And the claims team has done and the finance team a terrific job of getting underneath the data so that we understand where and if we have any pressures, but we've seen it run very predictably. Mike Zaremski : Okay. That's very helpful. And lastly, my follow-up. Services segment, it feels like, driven by Allstate Protection continues to do, I think, better than expected, and it's actually kind of moving the needle a little bit these days. You talked about diversifying into \u2013 outside of the U.S. I mean, just since it's growing so fast, should we expect the rate of growth to temper? Any additional color there would be around what's going on would be helpful. Tom Wilson : Let me provide just overview like why we talked about it, and then Don can talk about its future. So, when we bought it, one of the things we said was, we'll come back and talk to you about how we're doing every so often. And that's what we wanted to do here. And it's meeting and exceeding our expectations. I think there are a number of people. We're trying to understand why we were into that space, and you can see it's a huge growth. And we've had huge growth both domestically, and we're starting to get some good growth internationally. So, it was really about coming back to you and saying, we told you we'd come back, and here we are. And it happens to be a good news story, which Don can talk about. Don Civgin : Yes. Thank you. So, first, thanks for noticing. The service businesses, I think, in total, have made a lot of progress and has improved the values that they provide to customers. And so I think across the Board, they're doing really good work, more specifically around the Allstate Protection Plans. I mean, Mario laid out the three goals that we set and how we're doing against them. But I'd remind you, we set those goals the first quarter after we did the acquisition, and we communicated those, and we've been consistent about them. And we have had a really strong trajectory since we acquired SquareTrade, both on the topline and improvements in profitability all along the way. This particular quarter was good, but I'd remind you we expected to have a good 2020 to begin with. And that's because we were continuing to pick up new customers. We were doing a really good job working with our partners to make the product more available and accessible to their customers. And so we expect the growth not only for new business-to-business customers, but also more availability in existing customers and our international business continues to grow substantially. So, we expected 2020 to be good. We have benefited from the virus in some ways, and topline is one of them. When you look at the partners that we do our largest business with, they tend to be the larger one-stop shops. Which, as you would know, have been in favor in the retail world -- retail is doing mix these days. But if you're a large one-stop shop, we've done quite well. In the categories that we are particularly in consumer electronics and so forth and home office, have also done very well. So, we benefited because of the virus with the topline. And then, obviously, the topline has a benefit to the bottom-line with respect to scale of the expenses and so forth. So, we're very happy with the results. The results would have been strong even without the virus. They have clearly been helped to buy the virus, both on the topline and the bottom-line. But we're still very happy with the underlying performance as well. The only thing I'd add is, it's hard to tell what the impact of the virus is going to be going forward. And that's just going to depend on consumer behavior, where they buy, what they buy. So, while we benefited from impacts from the virus at this point, it's hard to tell what's going to happen in the future. But all that said, the underlying business has been and continues to be quite strong and we're quite bullish on it. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Paul Newsome : Good morning. I wanted to ask about bad debt trends within the quarter itself. And I guess I'm wondering whether or not we could see more when the Federal subsidies for unemployment go away or if maybe the bad debt is more tied to some of the state level moratoriums on -- that were in place. Just your thoughts on that would be great. Tom Wilson : Mario, do you want to take that? Mario Rizzo : Sure. Paul, this is Mario. So, just to give you a little context of the driver of bad debt, as we mentioned earlier, one of the ways that we provided additional benefits to our customers during the pandemic was to offer them the opportunity to opt into a special payment plan, which essentially gives them 60 days of coverage without having to make a payment on the policy. That started in March. And we've \u2013 as we've worked our way through the quarter, we've gotten more and more experience relative to how that subset of customers has performed and then the bad debt activity within that customer segment, because as much as we had historical context around offering similar-type programs during catastrophes, this was obviously much more widespread and different. And you see the impact in the quarter where bad debt was $44 million. We'll continue to get more and more experience on that customer set going forward. We'll continue to update our analysis, and then we'll update the numbers in the third quarter, if we need to. But based on the experience we've seen so far through the end of Q2, that's what we recorded in the P&L. Tom Wilson : And Paul, I would wrap that into just the overall pandemic impact, right? So we've obviously had lower frequency, which we've talked a lot about. This is another cost associated with the pandemic. And when we're thinking about what we're going to do in the future, we factor all this stuff in. Paul Newsome : Makes sense. Second question, I wanted to ask about whether or not you think the regulators will take into account sort of the, hopefully, one-time nature of the pandemic? Or if we put through \u2013 when you put through rate filings in the future, will you kind of have this middle of the Python kind of situation where the unusual low frequency is embedded in what you can file for rates prospectively until that kind of rolls off through the system. Tom Wilson : Well, it's always hard for us, of course, to speak for somebody else as to what they will do. And of course, it varies by state, which oftentimes relates to the political environment in that state. What I can say is, we were out early, no regulator forces to do shelter-in-place payback or expand coverage and all the other things we did. And so we got out ahead of it. I think we got positive feedback from people that we were doing what was not required, like no one had to come in and say, you must do this. And so I feel like we're on a good basis to work through like what's the right price. And if frequency were to stay at these abnormal lows, obviously, regulators, customers in the competitive market wouldn't have you charge the same amount. The good news is our loss cost would be a lot better. So our focus, really, Paul, is on maintaining our overall competitive position and our margins. And we've been able to do that with regulators. I think there'll be a whole bunch of stories. But the good news is we have good math, an operating model that adjusts locally in a way in which we can continue then grow profitably. Glenn, anything you would add to that? Glenn Shapiro : No. I think that covered it well. Paul Newsome : Thanks for your help. Everyone, stay safe, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore. Your question please. David Motemaden : Hi, good morning. Just a question for Tom and Glenn. Just thinking bigger picture, I'm just wondering how you guys are thinking about miles driven and accident frequency over the longer term. And I know there's a lot of uncertainty, but are you guys thinking -- how are you guys thinking about miles driven and accident frequency? Do you think that we'll ever get back to levels that we were at pre-COVID, especially given what seems like increasingly prevalent adoption of remote working arrangements? And relatedly, how are you guys going to adjust to potential lower frequency levels on a more sustained basis? Tom Wilson : Let me start, Glenn and then jump in. I'm going to start, David, the most macro which is of course, our strategy includes a couple of different components, the top over Property-Liability and then the bottom of other stuff. In the Property-Liability stuff, there's auto, big driver of that. And as -- and that's a key part of our both revenue and profitability. But the other thing is, we have a really profitable homeowners business, much more profitable than other people. We're good at it. We're precise at it. We sell a bunch of other stuff. And then the circle protection selling things like the service plans and everything is about making sure the company has multiple things we can sell to customers to protect them from whatever goes wrong in their life and leverage those customer bases. So we're dealing with -- because you had the same question that was about the same question about the future of auto was really around autonomous vehicles 3 or 4 years ago. And so we've been on that path from a strategic standpoint as to how to deal with that. And, of course, what's happened is, actually, premiums have gone up, not down in the last 4 or 5 years, which people were afraid nobody was going to drive. So it's really hard to predict. What you can do is have multiple options and take advantage of those options and leverage your skills and capabilities. As it relates to the auto insurance business, you want to have a broad-based approach. And that's what transformative growth really is. It's improve the customer value proposes, give people lots of access, connect to more, make your products more simple. And so we still have a lot of the share of that market we can pick up. And so even if you were to say fewer miles driven, lower average premium, we still think we can grow that business. Glenn, you might want to have some -- that was obvious sort of macro and longer term. How would you react to the question on more really as it relates to personal Profit-Liability in the shorter term? Glenn Shapiro : Yes. And it's a great question because, obviously, we think a lot about this. Let me take you into how the team works on this. And I'll go -- like Tom did, I'll go before even the virus. We had built out a model and assumptions for the change in frequency driven purely by the change in the car fleet out in the market. What does each component of ADAS, safety equipment on cars, what does each component do to change each type of loss, like how many fewer sideswipes or rear ends or intersection actions are we going to have based on the blind spot warning or based on this autonomous feature or so on? And you add those up and you apply them to your fleet and how the fleet is changing over time, and we actually -- we've built into the model, our assumptions were what changes. But at the same time, we built the other side of it, which is the severity. Because all those cars getting into fewer accidents are a heck of a lot more expensive to fix when they have all that equipment on it. And so it goes to what Tom said about, really, it's hard to predict, but we go after it and we look at with as much specificity as we can, the component parts. So now take that into the current scenario and the question you're asking. And we're looking at, so what percentage of the market works in jobs that don't have to commute? If you work in a restaurant or your dental hygienist or like -- but you're going to have to commute because those things cannot be done remotely. But there are a lot of jobs, most of us have jobs that can be done more remotely than they have been historically. So you get that percentage. And then you look at, well, what percentage of people will do it, and then what percentage of your accidents occur in like high drive time, and you start making your assumptions and picks over what's going to change. And similarly, that then changes severity because one of the things we've learned is that the losses that go away quickest are the bumper-to-bumper accidents in high traffic, and those tend to be low severity. So while a 10% decrease in frequency is great, it's not necessarily a 10% decrease in loss costs. And the reason I'm getting into or micro, since Tom took the macro on this and laid it out, is hopefully just to give you confidence that we look at this in a very detailed way and a thoughtful way, and our teams work through what the expectations are, and then we're able to move quickly on the fly when we're either above or below it with what our prediction is. David Motemaden : Great. Thanks for that comprehensive answer. I appreciate that. And if I could just sneak in just one more on just a quick numbers question. If I think about that 50 basis point improvement in the expense ratio, if I take out the one-time-ish items in 2Q, and then it was roughly 80 basis points in the first half versus the first half last year, is that -- and I know there are a lot of different moving pieces there, but is that the sort of level of year-over-year improvement that we should expect to see going forward? Tom Wilson : Yes. I would say transformative growth is about reducing expenses. In part, it's just one component, but it's about reducing expenses, so we can improve our customer value proposition with better prices, without impacting our margins. But it's going to bounce around a lot by quarter. You got advertising. We're going to have \u2013 we have new advertising. We're going to launch \u2013 you have some technology spend. But you should expect the overall trend going down. I don't think we could predict how much it will change by every quarter because \u2013 or set a target that way, because then it leaves unnatural consequences. So \u2013 but you should expect it to keep going down, yes. David Motemaden : No. Thanks fair. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Your question, please. Suneet Kamath : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the frequency benefit issue, if I could. I get that you want to be more surgical in terms of how you're approaching this, as opposed to more broad-based, which makes sense, but, I guess, the question is, do you \u2013 are you comfortable or confident that you won't see an impact on policy growth to the extent that some of your competitors actually stick with much more of a broad-based approach? Tom Wilson : Well, it's always hard to tell what customers will do. We've always found that precision works for us on the long term, and that those people who rush to grow and not have precision to it, end up having to fix it later. So if you look at homeowners, people trying to grow in homeowners are taking huge losses. Like, we just don't think that's the right way to build the business, because you get the customer for a price that's not appropriate, and then you either have to lose them or manage them to a much higher price. So, all I can say is, what we'll do. But it's a reasonably \u2013 it's a highly competitive market, but it's a thoughtful market, right? Like people are not crazy in this market and trying to use bad economics. So all of our major competitors understand their business well and why they might make different bets at different times. I feel like, the basis of competition is still going to stay the same. Whoever is the smartest, win. Suneet Kamath : Got it. Okay. And then I just wanted to ask one on the National General deal, if I could. I see that you're still guiding to this, I guess, high single-digit accretion, I think, was the original guidance. But when we were running the math, just based on where expectations were for Allstate and Nat General based on consensus, we were getting something close to high single digit or in a high single digits EPS accretion, without factoring in any cost synergies. So I'm just trying to understand, is there any help that you can give us in terms of what you're building in with respect to cost synergies? I don't think you talked about on the last call, but any help there would be appreciated. Tom Wilson : What, I would say is, we don't own it yet. So our projections haven't really changed. We do have cost saves in the middle of it that we figured out in terms of what we factored in when we bought \u2013 when we agreed to pay the price we did. And it did lead to accretion, as you point out. But right now, we're working on -- Glenn and Barry are working hard on what is the transition program. So as we get more specifics on things that we can lay out for you that are, here's our measurable goals, we'll do that. But, right now, we're just like a month into it. Suneet Kamath : All right. Thanks, Tom. Operator : Thank you. Mark Nogal : Jonathan, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Certainly. Then our final question for today comes from the line Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Your question, please. Ryan Tunis : Good morning. This might be a question for Glenn, but it seems like there's some decoupling between trends in miles driven and trends in frequency with, I guess, the latter declining quite a bit more. I guess my question is, what indicators that you're seeing in your book do you think are actually the best predictive indicators of what frequency is doing in this current environment? Tom Wilson : That's a tough question. I will let Glenn do that one. Glenn Shapiro : Thanks. So it's a good question. And you're right about the decoupling, so I'll give you a little background on that. Not all miles are created equal. If you're driving in a high-traffic environment, you are much more likely to get an accident because it's less forgiving. You take your eyes off the road. You're distracted driving, which, by the way, I don't recommend at any time. But if you're doing it in loose traffic and you make a mistake, you're less likely to bump into somebody than when you're doing it in high traffic. So what we're seeing is with commuting miles being way down, that has a little bit of an exponential effect on frequency. So if miles came back to a new normal for non-commuting, but were lower only on commuting, it would have a disproportionate effect on the frequency. So hopefully, that answers your question. It's \u2013 we're looking at the data in that way. And our \u2013 with the partnership with Arity and the partnerships they have with a lot of the non-insurance companies out there, and they get a lot of miles-driven data on those, and that what they do for us with our own data, is extremely helpful in that. Tom Wilson : And Ryan \u2013 and Glenn's example also is goes for rural and urban too, right? So think of the same thing, not just time and day also. So Montana, the frequency is not down as much as it is in urban areas because there's fewer people. There's always less congestion. So it is a difficult question. But the good news is we're on top of it. I know you all have another call. Thank you for participating and listening to our story. We'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Mark Nogal. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Nogal : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Allstate's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q, and posted today's presentation on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and further context on a Transformative Growth Plan to accelerate growth in the personal property-liability business. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and the investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2019 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Good morning everybody. As usual, we appreciate you joining us, investing your time to learn more about Allstate. This was just an exceptional quarter. I mean, we're adapting, we're executing, we're investing for the future. We adapted to the pandemic, the wildfires, the hurricanes, record low interest rates, and despite all of that, our execution enabled us to make $1.1 billion. At the same time, our Transformative Growth is coming to light. The stock is a great value on any measure. So we executed a $750 million ASR. Our team has performed exceptionally well this year, serving customers, creating economic value, and building a stronger foundation for growth. So let's start on Slide 2, which has Allstate's strategy, which is shown by the two ovals on the left. We're going to increase market share on Personal Property-Liability with our Transformative Growth Plan, which has three components. You remember that : expand customer access; improve customer value, which includes improving our price position and launching new products; and then investing in marketing technology. You'll hear more about that from Glenn, and then we'll - and then Mario will go through the numbers, and then we'll get to your questions. We're also expanding our protection businesses to increase - which is increasing the total addressable market we serve. We have an edge in this expansion by leveraging the Allstate brand, our customer base and our operating capabilities, which you can see in between those two ovals. For a company that empowers customers that is, you know we provide affordable simple connected products. There has been plenty to protect them from this year. As I mentioned, we get all kinds of severe weather and catastrophes and there we moved with speed and efficiency, and you can see that from our third quarter results, and those are shown on the right. Our profitability was excellent. Adjusted net income was $2.94 a share, and return on equity 17.7%. Underwriting results also remain really strong, we get favorable auto insurance results which offset the elevated home insurance losses from increased catastrophes. Implementation in Transformative Growth Plan is accelerating with the initiation of cost reduction plan in the new Allstate advertising campaign. Investment income was off slightly due to lower interest rates, but the performance-based income returned to prior year levels. We did have an annual review of our actuarial assumptions for Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuity businesses which assumes that the continued low interest rate environment carries forward and reduces future investment income over the next 25 years and that resulted in several charges for the reduced net income, and Mario will go through a specific slide to show you how that works. Allstate Protection Plans has continued to grow policies, revenue and income, while expanding its total addressable market or total addressable market. So despite a tumultuous operating environment, we delivered great customer experiences, growth, excellent returns and progress on the Transformative Growth Plan. If we go to Slide 3, let's do the numbers. Total revenues of $11.5 billion increased 3.9% to the prior year quarter, and that reflects both higher net realized capital gain and growth in property-liability premiums earned. Net income of $1.1 billion increased by 26.7% to the prior year quarter, as you can see that in the table, as higher revenues more than offset Allstate Life and Annuity income in connection - which was down because in connection with those actuarial assumption. Adjusted net income of $923 million was $2.94 per share. It was $23 million lower than the prior year quarter. Its higher auto insurance underwriting income was more than offset by the elevated catastrophe losses or restructuring charges related to Transformative Growth and the lower Allstate Life and Annuities income. Our returns remained excellent, and as I said, the return on equity is well above the range that we've discussed. So let me turn it over to Glenn, who will talk about third quarter results for Personal Property-Liability. Glenn Shapiro : Thanks Tom. So let's go to Slide 4, and we'll discuss the - as Tom said, very strong performance of our Property-Liability business. Before going deeper into the results, it's worth mentioning that consistent with how we operate under Transformative Growth, Insurance and Allstate Financial results were combined beginning in the third quarter. Property-liability results were strong with excellent recorded and underlying profitability. Growth was modest and lower than prior year quarter for auto insurance, but in the range that we expected as we build the foundation of Transformative Growth. And let me go into some detail on that before continuing on this slide. First, the three components of Transformative Growth were all making progress. The path is a bit steeper though at the beginning for several reasons. One, in our direct business, we lowered advertising for insurance brand since its being sunset, and that has a negative impact on new business there. At the same time, we've improved new business sales flows for online sales and improved our sales practices in our call centers for the Allstate brand being sold direct, which is significantly increasing volumes there but not yet enough to offset the insurance drop. Volume in our Allstate agents channel is on plan, except for the first two months of the pandemic, and we believe the shift in compensation towards new business that we start this year is working. We stopped hiring new agents under the existing commission contract early this year, since we're building a new lower cost agent model. We also increased base level production requirements coming into this year for agents as we're investing in agents who want to grow their business. This resulted in a planned and expected decline in licensed producers as we build the foundation on a high quality set of producers. We were in the right place with the right product at the right time when it comes to Milewise, which is our pay-per-mile product. That's really appealing to customers right now, because they are driving less during the pandemic, and we're the only major carrier offering a product like that. In the independent agent channel, Encompass had a small negative impact on growth, reflecting homeowners increases. National General acquisition which is pending will expand our access into the independent agent channel and we're really excited about the growth prospects there after closing. The cost reductions we're implementing will enable us to further improve our competitive position in auto insurance and drive growth while earning attractive returns. And on the homeowner side, premium grew 2.6% from the prior year quarter. This was due to policy growth of 1.2% and average premium increases. We're really well positioned for further growth in the homeowners business. In total, we believe that the foundation we are building to be a major player in both the direct space and independent agent space that will add to our great exclusive agent channel that we already have will lead to transformative growth. So now we'll go back to our slide and we've got a bullet or two here. Underwriting income was $753 million, increasing $16 million compared to the prior year. While the recorded combined ratio was equal to last year's third quarter, there were many meaningful changes underneath that, which are shown in the lower left chart. Starting on the left, the underlying loss ratio improved 7.8 points, primarily due to lower auto insurance losses from fewer accidents due to lower miles driven. Underlying loss ratio improvement was offset by elevated catastrophe losses in homeowners, unfavorable reserve development in discontinued lines, restructuring charges and Allstate's efforts to help customers during the pandemic, which are all shown in red. Catastrophe losses of $990 million in the third quarter were driven by a very active hurricane season and ongoing wildfires in the West Coast. This is partially offset by favorable prior year catastrophe development recognized in the quarter with $450 million and $45 million respectively coming from the PG&E and Southern California Edison subrogation settlements. Non-catastrophe prior year reserve re-estimates were adverse $70 million in the quarter, this includes $132 million adverse from the annual review of asbestos, environmental and other reserves in the Discontinued Line and Coverage segment, which was partially offset by favorable re-estimates in the Allstate Protection personal lines. The chart on the right breaks down the expense ratio components. Excluding the impact of restructuring charge and bad debt in the third quarter, the expense ratio was 22.6, a 1.1 point improvement compared to prior-year quarter. It also represents a 2.5 point improvement if you go back to 2018. Moving to Slide 5, let's discuss our progress on Transformative Growth. And as Tom covered, Transformative Growth is a multi-year effort to accelerate growth through three components : expanding customer access, improving customer value, and investing in marketing and technology. Customer access was expanded by combining the direct sales capabilities under the Allstate brand, which enables us to leverage insurances capabilities with a stronger brand of Allstate. We're also enhancing local agent sales models to improve effectiveness and efficiency. And customer value is being improved by implementing a cost reduction program. This enables us to offer more affordable prices while maintaining strong margins. We also continue to improve the competitive price position of auto insurance with pricing sophistication. The third component is investing in marketing and technology. In the third quarter, we launched our new advertising campaign to reposition the brand supported by increased spend. Technology investments continue to improve customer facing interactions including the launch of the Allstate OneApp which simplifies all of our digital interactions in access, including telematics offerings. Moving to Slide 6, we're still deeper into a few of the actions taken in the third quarter to advance Transformative Growth. We're executing a cost reduction plan that streamlining operations and processes across claims, sales, service and support functions to lower costs. Lower costs enable us to have more affordable price without sacrificing attractive returns. The plan impacts approximately 3,800 employees this year, which will result in a charge of $290 million, with $198 million of that recognized in the third quarter and the balance in future quarters. The bulk of the charges for employee benefits incentives, including expanded transition support, extended medical coverage and deployment search assistance. The remainder is driven by real estate exit costs. At the same time, we launched a new advertising campaign in September built on the belief that we all deserve to live life well protected, as shown on the right side of the slide. The campaign repositions our brand and updates the messaging to generate business across a broader audience by showing the breadth of product portfolio we have including identity and service protection. The campaign also emphasizes a connected experience with telematics capabilities as customers' behaviors and needs are changing. I'll now turn it over to Mario to cover the rest of our results. Mario Rizzo : Thanks Glenn. Let's go to Slide 7, which highlights investment performance for the quarter. The chart on the left shows net investment income totaled $832 million in the quarter, which was $48 million below prior year due to a decline in market-based income. Market-based income shown in blue was $68 million below the prior year quarter. With lower interest rates, our reinvestment rates remain below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield which reduces income. Performance-based income totaled $210 million in the third quarter as shown in gray, partially reversing valuation declines recorded in the first half of the year. GAAP total returns are shown in the table on the right. Year-to-date returns were 4.4% and the latest 12 months was 5.7%, reflecting higher fixed income and public equity valuations. Performance-based investment return was 2.4% for the quarter, but remained negative year-to-date. Our performance-based strategy has a longer-term investment horizon with higher but more volatile return expectations compared to the market-based portfolio. The compound annual rate of return on the performance based portfolio is 7.2% over the past five years as is shown on the bottom right of the table, exceeding the market-based return by 220 basis points. Let's move to Slide 8 and review results for Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuities. Allstate's annual review of assumptions and the expectation of lower long-term interest rates unfavorably impacted the Allstate Life, benefits and Annuities segments in the third quarter. Allstate Life shown on the left recorded an adjusted net loss of $14 million in the third quarter. The loss was due to accelerated amortization of deferred acquisition costs, primarily from lower projected future interest rates related to the annual review of assumptions. Higher contract benefits also reduced adjusted net income, including $22 million in coronavirus death claims. Allstate Benefits adjusted net income of $33 million in the third quarter was $2 million higher than the prior year quarter, driven by a decrease in contract benefits, primarily due to lower claim experience. This decrease was driven by limited activities and the deferral of non-essential medical procedures as a result of the pandemic. The benefit from lower reported claim experience was partially offset by the acceleration of deferred acquisition cost amortization related to the annual review of assumptions. Allstate Annuities had adjusted net income of $37 million in the third quarter as contract benefits decreased primarily from favorable mortality experience compared to the prior year quarter. In the third quarter, Allstate Annuities also recorded a premium deficiency reserve of $225 million, pre-tax, given the expectation that interest rates will remain low over the long duration of these liabilities and annuitants are living longer than originally anticipated. While this reduced net income for the quarter, it did not impact adjusted net income. And let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss the Allstate Annuities and the premium deficiency reserve in a little more detail. As you can see on the chart, we've been reducing our Annuity business consistently over the last 15 years to manage risk-adjusted returns. As a result of this dynamic, we began to systematically exit these businesses. In 2006, we reinsured the variable annuity business. In 2010, we exited the broker dealer channel. In 2013, we stopped issuing structured settlements. And in 2014, we stopped issuing all remaining annuity products and sold Lincoln Benefit Life. As a result, liabilities declined from $75 billion in 2005 to $17.5 billion as of the end of the third quarter. Today, liabilities are made up of that $17.5 billion dollars of reserves and contract holder funds related to deferred and immediate annuities. Our asset liability management strategy has positioned the portfolio to cash match near term liabilities while investing in public equities and performance-based assets for longer duration liabilities to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. Two-thirds of the payments on these annuities are expected to be made after 2030. As part of our third quarter review of actuarial assumptions we lowered our long-term return assumptions given the expectation that interest rates will remain low for an extended period. This reduces expected future investment income. Mortality assumptions were also updated to reflect the expectation that annuitant will live longer. These two changes led to a forecast where current reserves and expected returns on those reserves over the life of these annuities is less than the expected payouts, which led to the charge of $225 million pretax. So now let's go to Slide 10 and discuss the results of our service businesses. The service businesses continue to generate strong growth as policies in force increased 38.6% to $133 million in the third quarter, driven by Allstate Protection plans growth. Revenue, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses grew 16.9% to $484 million in the third quarter. Adjusted net income of $40 million reflects an increase of $32 million compared to the third quarter of 2019. The improvement continues to be driven by the growth of Allstate Protection Plans and improved profitability at Allstate roadside services. Now let's turn to Slide 11 to review the results of Allstate Protection plans in a bit more detail. So, as you remember, the acquisition in early 2017 for $1.4 billion further expanded our circle of protection for customers and continues to exceed growth and profit expectations. As you can see in the chart on the left, Allstate Protection Plan has had exceptional growth since acquisition in early 2017. Policies in force increased more than fourfold from less than 30 million policies in 2017 to 126 million in the third quarter of 2020. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 51%. In addition, net written premium of $831 million for the first nine months of 2020 increased 50% compared to the prior year period. On the right you can see that Allstate Protection plans began generating positive adjusted net income in early 2018, which is earlier than expected. The upward trajectory has continued this year, generating $105 million of adjusted net income through the first nine months of 2020. Even more important to shareholder value is the trajectory going forward from here. The team has successfully expanded the total addressable market into appliances, furniture, cellular carriers and international markets with revenues in each of these areas. The combination of attractive unit economics, scalable technology platform and the power of The Allstate brand will lead to continued profitable growth in this business. Quite simply, this is not your typical protection platform. Finally on Slide 12, we want to highlight Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate generated strong returns on capital with an adjusted net income return on equity of 17.7% as of the end of the third quarter. We returned $967 million to common shareholders in the third quarter. Through a combination of $798 million in share repurchases and $169 million in common stock dividends. Over the last year, we have reduced common shares outstanding by 6.4% primarily as a result of our share repurchase program. As you can see from the table. Book value per share of $82.39 increased 18% compared to the third quarter of last year, reflecting income generation and increased fixed income valuations, partially offset by cash returned to shareholders. Allstate stock valuation metrics, however, have not kept pace with this combined strength and strong operating performance. With that context we will open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Yaron Kinar : First question is with regards to top line growth. So I understand there are a lot of moving parts here and you're selling early to maybe the end of the beginning of the transformative growth plan. At what point do you think we actually do start seeing the initiative and the various components there resulted in top line growth? Tom Wilson : Yaron, this is Tom. So they - we can't really give you a quarter and say here's one that turn a say you should buy the stock right before that. So that what is really reflecting the terrible pop because a number of things happening. Right? So we're trying to make sure we take care of our existing customers well, and that requires, as we change out some of the agents and the stuff Glenn talked about, we have to make sure we're doing that well with integrated service and moving people to other agencies. Second, there is obviously a competitive market in which we're in. So part of it depends what happens with our competitors and what they do, how much more they put into advertising, how much they raise homeowners prices. I think that what I would say is the focus seems to be narrowed down to just auto insurance and really transformative growth is about auto insurance is about home insurance where we're getting a growth - good growth and not as much as we think we can have, but certainly higher than auto and then the circle of protection. So I can't really call it by quarter. I would say is, you should expect as you see the components come into place. You should expect to see a trajectory up from here. But we're not giving specific guidance on here. Here's where more going to be at X percent of market share gains. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And then my second question, somewhat related these launch of the Allstate One app. Are there any metrics you can share with us around, have the company applications have been downloaded, take-up rate in the ease of use or how long it takes to get a quote on the app? Tom Wilson : Well we have - average that we have a whole bunch of metrics and we don't give most of them out, because we think we're starting to get in advantage versus our competitors on it and we really don't want them copying what we are doing that in both sub year on to your point, both on things like also in telematics. So we're really positive about what we got going on there. And, but we - I would tell you that the insurance industry in general is not to the level that banks are which says we have a lot of potential to increase our connectivity and lower cost at the same time. Glenn, anything you would add to that? Glenn Shapiro : No, I think that covers it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question please. Greg Peters : So I'm going to stick with the transformative growth plan. And I think in your second bullet point, you talked about improving customer value. So there's two pieces of that as we sit outside looking in, one is the expense ratio initiatives that you've highlighted. The other one would be just price to your customers. So can you give us an idea of where the expense ratio will go to or what sort of objective you have in the context of your competition? And then, on price, we have observed a number of your competitors starting to cut prices in the marketplace and in auto insurance and I'm curious about your posture with respect to that. Tom Wilson : Greg, let me start with the overview on transformer growth and then Glenn, if you could jump into where we are on pricing these. So transformer growth has three components, right. Second one is improved customer value, that is really two components to it. But one is improve the competitive price position and with affordable products. And second is to launch new products, the things like [indiscernible]. So the second piece is really about more differentiation price the cost piece is really the way a door you go through to get to the price piece. So they are not separate. So in the reason we haven't put cost targets out there, we obviously have cost target and we also have price competitive targets. The reason we haven't put those out there is, they are tightly linked. And we don't want to signal to our competitors, where we think we're going our price. So it's not that we don't have targets we do, and we think we can reduce our costs, which enables us to give customers better value called more affordable price without sacrificing attractive margins. So that's the path we're on. Reduce expenses, if those expense is down turn that into a more affordable price, which increases your closed rate, which then drives growth. So the first - it's really one component that you're talking about. The second piece will take some time, because you have to rebuild the whole technology stack, there's just a bunch of work that has to be done to launch new products. That will take a couple of years to really get done, which is why we keep this is a multi-year initiative. Glenn, do you want to give Greg an update on pricing and your thoughts there? Glenn Shapiro : Yes, you've covered, Tom. Well, the - going forward, how we bring the cost down and keep margins while being a better value for customers. But I don't want to leave anybody the impression that we're not moving now because sometimes you can look at a like an investor supplement and say, well, it was zero rate taken and think that that means there is zero rate action. We have made hundreds of filings over the last quarter, all across the country and I know you always hear me say it Greg, but we manage this at the market level. So we've got a really talented group of state managers, I always talk about that. They've got their hands on the lever they\u2019re looking at, how competitive are we each competitor in this market, what's our close rate doing, what type of shifts are we seeing in customers and quoting and they're moving those levers all the time and we're working with regulators to do that. So the hundreds of filings that we've made already since the pandemic and through this time have materially changed our competitive position in spite of that 0.0, you see on total rate filing. We've done things like improved our competitive position on telematic products, increased new business discounts, changed pricing around for the type of people that are shopping. And so the average person that's out there shopping for insurance is getting a lower price rate now for us than they were six months ago or nine months ago meaningfully lower. And so this is how we stay competitive, and it goes a little bit back to Yaron's comment or question on growth, and I look at it as while we're building this foundation, like I mean we're setting up the capability for us to be a major player in direct. We are setting up the capability for us to be a major player in independent agent with the acquisition that's pending. And while we're building that foundation, I'd call it, we're holding our own. Like we actually grew policies year-over-year, policies in force, minimally in auto more so in home, but we're doing a good job of keeping the fight going and keeping our growth engine going in spite of building that foundation. Greg Peters : Your answers makes sense. I guess the second question, and it's just going to pivot to the other source of income would be investment income and just looking over the Slide 7 and considering Mario's comments, there is obviously two pieces and it's been volatile this year. But it feels like because of the current interest rate environment there is going to be downward pressure on your market-based returns and therefore investment earnings you generate off that for the next year or two. And then also on the performance base, the volatility is interesting for us to try and model. So can you frame it for us as we think about what the future performance might be of the performance-based portfolio? Tom Wilson : Greg, let me go up and then, John you can talk about the risk adjusted return of volatility of the performance base. So - as - when we do our investment allocations all the way at the top, we look at risk adjusted return based on economic capital per asset class and so earlier this year when we sold $4 billion of our $6 billion of public equities, it was because we saw the pandemic come in or we thought there is going to be a dip down and then a bump back up, it was - and we are going to avoid that volatility. We just - we didn't think the risk adjusted return was right. When we look at our market-based results and you're right. Interest rates are coming down there at low rates, really low rates, you're probably not going to have as much capital on those bonds as you had historically. And we looked at the risk adjusted return on the performance space, we decided it was a better risk adjusted return on the performance is now. Obviously, it comes with more volatility and particularly from quarter to quarter, as you point out, so what we did is we matched those performance space, the long-term viability is on dated annuities or capital, which we expect to have for a long time and so when you do that you can handle that in term volatility because - and that's why you get the higher risk adjusted return because you're taking on that volatility. And once you get past seven years, - you're better off owning equities and bonds, as you all know well from just looking at the pension funds. And you get past 10 years and it's like you get double the return and you actually have less risk on equity. So that's how we got to performance-based equities and we're willing to accept that volatility either because we have liabilities or capital which we know will have and will recoup the incremental economic return over time. Before I turn to John let me just - one other thing, as you look forward, what we do of course, is when we're managing our auto business in particular, we look at what underwriting margin do we need given what we think we're going to get in investment income. So to the extent investment income, it goes down, we given our power in underwriting, we're able to still make a good return for our shareholders even with slightly lower interest rates. Unlike some of the life companies who have no other way to adjust their future premiums. So John, do you want to spend a few minutes talking about performance space? John Dugenske : Yes sure, Tom. And Greg, thanks for the question. I'll pick up where Tom left off. When you think about performance base it can be volatile for periods of time. As Tom mentioned, we really match it off versus longer liabilities that we have. If you take a longer-term view and this is information that's in the supplement, - over a 10-year period, the internal rate of return, which is a common way of measuring these assets is about 11.5% and when you look at it over 10 years or over five years relative to the public equity benchmarks that we think about owning these assets against, they are superior in terms of return. So we're willing to take some of that volatility relative to more observable public markets because we think we've got a team that has skill and expertise that can extract value out of the marketplace that it isn't easy for other people to do. I tend to think of it is we've got a lot of flash lights that we can shine in different corners of the market that maybe everyone else doesn't have to extract additional value. Now you're right to point out there has been a little bit bumpier during the course of this year and that does require some explanation. Yes, I think we'd all agree this year, it has been a pretty unique year and when you think about what releases income in performance-based assets, part of that is the deal flow itself, you need to - we invest in a particular entity, whether it's a fund or an individual investment, it improves in value over time. And then we tend to sell those investments and it generates income. During the period of time when deal flow was down because people just travel to do due-diligence and that sort of thing it's normal to understand that that income was reduced. There was also and we disclosed this earlier in the year, we did have some loss, we had about $130 million in actual losses in that place in as well. What we've seen this quarter is a beginning of returning to more normalized deal activity. So we're not going to predict the future here, but there is reason if you look back, relative to what we've experienced historically, we're starting to see a pattern that starts to fit in a little bit. So long dated liabilities matches up well versus that. We like the long run returns even though they're more volatile, but we think there is a period of what we can do in public markets. When it comes to rates you've seen us Greg, you've seen us be proactive in the way that we think about investing in our market-based portfolio. And as Tom said, that's part of a larger enterprise system where we think about risk and return across the enterprise, whether it's underwriting risk, mortality risk or investment risk and return, and we've made changes over time to address for different market environments. So a good example of that is coming out of the global financial crisis. We reduced interest rate risk as rates became lower and we took more credit risk. We thought that it was, that had a good risk return profile. As rates started to increase in recent years, we've lengthened our duration to take advantage of that and that's served us quite well as interest rates have fallen here. And we've subsequently in beginning of the year we saw less value on a risk adjusted basis for public equities and reduce that. One thing that may not be completely obvious is during the course of the year, this year we've taken further actions - we're not only are we helping buffer income by increasing duration, but we've also moved some of that equity exposure and some of our pure government exposure into almost $10 billion of investment grade credit some high quality, high yield and associated securities to help minimize the impact that lower rates we will have. I mean you're right, if rates stay this slow for a long period of time there will be a reduction of income, it's just kind of pure math that play out that way. When I look at the Slide 7 of the presentation and you see those blue lines. It just doesn't happen that rapidly part of our investments are matched off versus longer liabilities. So they're cash matched and then part of it has to happen as the portfolio tends to roll off over periods of time. So, it will happen if rates remain low for a long period of time, it won't happen overnight. And we're hopeful like most people are that interest rates will recover some ground as we pull out of the COVID-induced lower interest rate paradigm that we're currently in. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your question, please. Mike Zaremski : First question, looking through the deck I see one of statements saying improved online and call center sales flow in Allstate direct. Can you give us a flavor for how much of your sales today I think mostly think of Allstate as a agency-based seller of insurance, but how much is coming from direct? And related, I believe in the past you've said that as part of the transformation program, you might be offering a discount to existing customers to potentially use more of the direct platform versus the agents, is that still part of the game plan? Tom Wilson : Mike, let me first start with the overview and [indiscernible] and Glenn, if you want to talk about sort of sales flows and what you've got going on in sales. And so, we've put together the usage, so if you looked at our old stuff last quarter you would see Esurance broken out and that was 100% direct, either online or through call centers. We did also sell some business under the Allstate brand in the same manner, mostly through call centers, but a little bit online. And with the new format we have, we put those two together. And so, we're not planning on breaking out how much comes out direct and how much comes through agents. You're correct in that if you buy direct, today you get, what you paid for, so you don't pay for an agent. So you don't - the price is 7% lower if you buy direct from the company, but that's for only for new customers. We're not going back to existing customers and saying hey, how would you like the 7% price reduction because they are happy with their existing relationships. They bought from those agents, they have as we cross-sell into those agents. So there is no really need to go disrupt that were about giving it to people anyway they want. If you want an agent you can call us and get an agent and - you call center we\u2019ll get you an agent, and you can have a local agent. If you want to do self-serve, and you want to do it online, we'll do that as well. So the strategy is to really leverage the Allstate brand and take that Esurance money which was spent - Esurance advertising money which was hundreds of millions of dollars a year and throw that at the Allstate brand. So, that, we could compete more aggressively with GEICO and Progressive in the direct space. Glenn, do you want to talk about like sales flows and how you're making that work so? Glenn Shapiro : Yes, so the team that we've had that ran Esurance and has been put together as Allstate as Tom said, with the Allstate Group. And you would think that it would be relatively easy to flip a switch and say, hey, we're a direct company now and accordingly play big in this space. But we literally have decades of connective tissue and process built around everything is an off-ramp for an agency system. And so what we want to be and aspire to be in the near term, is a company that really goes to market in both ways. It's open access for a customer, customer that wants to click our call that we do that really effectively and we can compete with the biggest direct carriers out there. In that space and think about that as a full channel. And then it takes nothing away from the exclusive agent channel we have which is outstanding. They do an incredible job for customers. They've done a great job through the pandemic you can see it in our retention numbers and continue to grow that channel. But the work they've done is really the pick and shovel work of removing some of those pieces of connective tissue between channels and really going to market as a direct business. Esurance was set up that way because it was a separate run operation. This now is common product, its common back end service that we have, but it's a separate sales channel. Mike Zaremski : Last question, circling back to the annuity business and we do appreciate all the color. I think we all get asked a lot whether Allstate would entertain a transaction. So I know you've answered that in the past, but maybe I'll try to ask in a different way. So you've pointed out very well that you've moved a lot of the investments into kind of longer duration hopefully higher yielding assets, which is one of the things that some of the private equity backed firms do as part of their right their special sauce? So would you say that lower interest rate environment combined with how you guys positioned the portfolio kind of makes the bid-ask spread of entering a transaction wider than it was a year or so ago? Tom Wilson : First Mike, if you look at the one slide that we've taken annuities down some $75 billion to $17 billion over a period of time. And we've done that with a couple of objectives in mind, what we want to make sure we take care of customers do you want to get a good deal for shareholders. And so we've been kind of whittling away at it and these are the last two chunks we have left. And we're open to different ways to do that and if we look at all different ways to do it all the time so everything from reinsurance to sales, everything else. And so, I don't think lower interest - rates obviously are something you need to factor in. It's less important when you have the investment portfolio that you just mentioned in terms of what it does to the - it helps fill the gap from low interest rates because you're earning higher returns. I think we have decided so this - these are becoming more scarce properties because you've seen the asset managers go out and they like having what I would call captive asset. So there is a whole host of you are all familiar with that throughout and want to buy annuity blocks. So that they can have those assets to manage and then they separately finance the purchase of a company part with their money and part with other people's money it's a way to build a better revenue stream for themselves. We're open to that thing as long as it meets our two objectives. One, you got to take care of our customers. So some of these customers are going to get paid for 30-plus years we don't want to turn that somebody that's going to take it all and go to Las Vegas and put it on red. And then our customers are left hole in the bag. Secondly, we want to make sure it's good deal for our shareholders. So, we're always looking at opportunities to further reduce the exposure. I mean, you look at that trend line. We have a slide that is and it's - there is no reason to expect that we would try to change that trend line. It will go down by itself. So, like they do roll off people to stop collecting payments either because their term is up or they pass away. So, but you should expect it keep going down if we can find the right way to do that for shareholders and customers then we\u2019ll do it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Stefano from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please. Phil Stefano : So with the sun setting of the Esurance brand we\u2019re down to three brands now. I guess in my mind, part of the transformative growth plan is a rally behind the Allstate brand so strategically you could talk about the importance of Encompass and answer financial. As we think about the transformative growth plan over time? Tom Wilson : So it's Tom. I think it's really one brand. And we have some names, but right now we have one what I would call consumer brand. There is obviously some brands amongst agents. And so, you see us leveraging a brand, not just on direct, but Allstate Protection products. I don't believe we would have gotten Walmart and driven the kind of growth we have without the Allstate team on there and the Allstate backing. Same is true with Home Depot, which will be rolling out starting in January. So it's really one brand. There are - you do point out two other ways if you go to market. So Glenn, could you talk about plans or the independent agent channel Encompass with National General and then just touch on what you're doing with Answer Financial as well? Glenn Shapiro : Yes so in the IA space, it really is National General and I won't get into the brand, because I don't know if any decisions made in terms of exactly the brand. But as Tom said, it's more of a branding with agents than it is with customers in that channel. But with National General and Encompass it's really about bringing those together in sort of a reverse integration because National General has a platform, a technology platform that the IAs love. They have 42,000 existing relationships with agency locations to go along with the 10,000 that we have with Allstate and Encompass. And between the two companies, we have a product set that goes from non-standard all the way up through high net worth and everything in between. And what I always point out on this is, I think maybe the most important part is our homeowners\u2019 capability. The IA space they really need that the full stack and all the capabilities and we clearly have a premier homeowners capability at Allstate. So you put all of that together and we will have the most capabilities of any carrier we will be the Number 5 in size, as soon as the closing goes through in the IA space. But we will be number one in terms of overall top to bottom capabilities. That won't be the day that we go live it won't be that because we won\u2019t been able to integrate products and everything and push it across. But in short order we will be able to bring those together and really go to that market and be a very major player in the independent agent space. And that, pertaining there was second part to that. Phil Stefano : Answer Financial? Glenn Shapiro : No, I'm sorry Answer Financial, thanks. Yes, so on Answer Financial, that is - it's a very different type of model. That really is taking care of customers who we can't take care of in other ways. Are they sort of fall between the cracks of - always narrowing cracks actually at this point because we cover just about all different types of customers at this point. But the narrowing cracks there and it's a way to monetize the exhaust from our expense on marketing and make sure that anybody that comes to us - we can get to at some point. And so Answer Financial from a branding standpoint is separate and they sell multiple carriers. Phil Stefano : I think going back to the National General acquisition we noticed in the Q, that there was a note that you're currently contemplating the mix of cash and debt for that purchase. I was hoping you might be able to further find your point on what your thoughts are there. And just intertwine that into a - broader thoughts on capital management and share repurchases? Tom Wilson : Mario you could take that. Mario Rizzo : Sure, Phil. Thanks for the question. Yes - when we announced the National General acquisition, the financing strategy all along was part cash from our deployable capital part excess capital within the National General structure and part debt so that continues to be the strategy in terms of how we'll fund National General. So that part hasn't changed. So we fully expect it to execute across all three dimensions and the closed process is progressing on that acquisition. In terms of broader capital management - and I think Tom mentioned this early on. We continue to think the stock is undervalued. And we have ample capital and liquidity available to continue to buy back stock. We got - excuse me $2.8 billion holding company assets. We got over almost $7 billion of readily available liquidity. Our debt-to-cap ratios are below 20%. So we feel really good about the financial strength of the organization and that's one of the reasons. That combined with our view on the relative valuation of the stock is what led us to do the $750 million ASR in the fourth quarter. We got 7 million shares as part of that. We still have ways to go on the current share repurchase authorization. So we still have just under $1.6 billion left and we'll continue to execute on that. And the point that's worth mentioning is, as we've said from the beginning, the National General acquisition doesn't impact the buyback program. We fully expect to complete that by the end of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Shanker from Bank of America. Your question, please. Joshua Shanker : On your press release you were announcing the restructuring plan you made the comment that the cost reductions and job reductions were necessary in order to maintain underwriting ratios. I'm not really asking for guidance, but obviously COVID throws a little bit of curve on things? When we think about 2019, I guess is there actually a possibility in your long-term outlook that you think the type of underwriting margins you are achieving on a COVID-normalized basis can be maintained into the years going out given price reactions and given what your goals are? Tom Wilson : [technical difficulty] Josh, because I'm not sure what COVID-normalized are. But I think. I think the shortest way to answer that is we are in really attractive returns on auto insurance. We have for 14-15 years, maybe longer are running and we have a system and an objective and goals that we've achieved to continue that. When I say COVID-normalized, what we don't really know is certainly of course when the pandemic ends which is beyond your normalization. But I'm not sure what it will do to consumer behavior, particularly driving, I think computing is going to be viewed as overrated. And so, given that about a third of the time people are in their cars they're driving to and from work. So if even a small portion of people so 25% of the people commute less. That's a pretty big drop, and we will react to that when we can. I think what it does, it gives us more room to maintain the kind of returns we have while getting more competitive. And so, but you should assume we\u2019ll continue to be focused on earning attractive returns. That comment in the press release was really about saying, we didn't have to reduce cost, because we're not making money. There are a lot of people out there who today are airlines and other people were having let people go because they just in trouble. We're not in trouble. We're making really good money. And so we don't need to do it they are reason. We also as we're talking about getting more competitive in auto insurance in particular. We don't want everybody. Moving to the conclusion, which you could, if you took your question farther would be that we're going to do that by given in a way - like say anybody can give it away its talented teams that both grow and make money. And so, we were just trying to point out that the point that and Greg mentioned earlier, which is that the cost and the pricing are tightly linked. And I know a lot of you would like to have some expense ratio target that you could put into your models but trust us, we have a measure. It's a good measure, it's aggressive, but it's tied to what we're trying to do on price. So we're not willing to talk about that publicly. Joshua Shanker : And just a quick one on square trading growth. Obviously people are stuck at their homes, they've been buying a lot of stuff on Amazon and whatnot. Do you think that 2020 was a record year for consumer electronics purchasing and that 2021 will face some headwinds in beating 2020 as a year for new policy yet square trading or Allstate protection plans? Tom Wilson : Let me ask Don answer that and then just do a commercial before that, which is - we are stronger being together with SquareTrade than we were independently both in terms of what it does for a server protection and what we do for them in getting Walmart Home Depot leveraging the Allstate brand. But I would say you put this up against any of the recent IPOs out there. This thing is worth a whole lot more than we paid for. Don, do you want to talk about what happened? Don Civgin : Sure. So, Josh, first, the trends have been strong for a long time. So it's not like this year, all of a sudden SquareTrade took off, they've been doing well since the acquisition. It's been a combination of things that's driven that. It's the growth in the existing customers by which they've been able to help drive with their customers. It's been additional customers that they've added B2B customers additional retailers and then this thing that Mario talked about which is just extending their total addressable market. So three years ago there were largely consumer electronics to U.S. retail. But since then it's the more than consumer electronics, it's now appliances. It's now furniture, it's now international business that's growing dramatically. It's cell carriers and so forth. So it's been kind of expansion across the board, which has been consistent for the last three years. This year's results, you're right, we're impacted by COVID, they were going to be strong regardless. So this was going to be a really great year. We got the benefit of COVID but it wasn't just people buying online, it was the customers that we have the places, people are shopping in the categories that lend themselves to warranties are the ones that customers have been purchasing. So whether it's setting up our own office or setting up consumer electronics as you said. So this year has been good and it's been positively impacted, but I think it would be a big mistake to assume it wouldn't have been good anyway. And then when you get into 2021 and those underlying trends that I talked about that have been going for three years will continue. And so, we still expect them to continue to grow and do well. I suspect at some point the lack of buying power in the economy will probably dampen retail sales across the board, more hard to predict how that's going to happen when that's going to happen. But I think that's the - that's on the margin, the underlying trends will continue in a very strong manner. Joshua Shanker : Thank you very much. Tom Wilson : Add to that is, when you look forward in 2021 in Allstate Protection plans, the mix of policies going to change some. So you'll see the policy growth come, but you will see the revenues continue to accelerate as particularly as we get into bigger dollar amount per policy. So just one thing to get a warranty policy on a iPad, it's another thing for a washer or dryer or for furniture. So you should still see and we expect increased revenue growth, but you may see a slight take off of drop maintaining 51% company growth and policies gets hard as you move into bigger dollar policies. Now I'll take one more question and then we'll wrap up. Operator : Our final question then for the day comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper. Your question please. Paul Newsome : I guess I was hoping you could just revisit a little bit, you've already made some comments about driving behavior that's pandemic related and what you're seeing is changing, nothing terribly specific, but you had some peers are talking about these changes in driving for example, to work or not versus regular driving. As well, I was curious if you've seen differences that were material on a state basis. Again nothing specific to state, but if there is early insights into kind of what's happening from a dynamic - from an natural behavioral perspective, I think that would be very interesting. Tom Wilson : Glenn, why don't you answer that. I would say, Paul, the other part is with [Aire] tracking 26 million cars, we have 10 times the amount of miles driven that a company that recently went public. And so we got lots of good math on this. So, Glenn, can share with you what he is saying, just in terms of miles driven and what the impact is on frequency. Glenn Shapiro : Yes. And thanks for the question, Paul, it is interesting getting into the data in this space. And as Tom said, with billions of miles of data we've got and the partnership with [Aire] we're able to really get into the detail. The short answer to your question is yes. There are absolutely differences state by state. There are broad trends that are true everywhere when you see some of the things about commuting and total miles driven, but you will see based on sort of where states are in the pandemic where they have either formal stay at home orders or shutdowns or anything versus when they have more informal they just have a lot of cases coming in, and just attitude differ by state in terms of how to deal with either staying home or not and so on. So we do see differences by state, but there is enough of a prevailing sort of tailwind on it that there is more similarities than difference. A couple of things, just to go deeper on the comments Tom made before, we see about 40% of our losses happen in rush hour. And so, as we're working through and we predict, again, this gets to different states because obviously in metro areas it's more of a true some of that rush hour than the non-metro areas. But we get a double effect in terms of the frequency of those accidents in rush hour in one fewer people so fewer of our drivers that we insure are actually traveling during rush hour. And so, if you're not traveling, you're not having an accident. And two, the ones who still are, because it's not zero are on less congested roads, so they have fewer accidents, and you see that in the types of accidents that remain. So it is not a pure mix of - if there were a million accidents before and you take out 10% of them. It is not a random 10%. It is a very specific 10%. And so with the mix of what's left is very different and all of these are things that we are looking at in a granular level down to state detail. So that, as I mentioned before, those the pricing actions we take, the go-to-market actions we take are highly specific. Tom Wilson : So thank you all for participating. We had an excellent quarter. Mark is obviously available for any follow-up questions the things we didn't get to, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mark Nogal. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Nogal : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Allstate's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted today's presentation on our Web site at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements so please refer to the 10-K for 2019 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Amidst the pandemic Allstate delivered really attractive returns while building higher growth business models in 2020, exceptional progress has made building higher growth business models to execute our strategy of increasing market share in personal property liability, and expanding protections offered to its customers. And as you know, one of our key focuses this year was transitioning the personal property liability business to higher growth. We took decisive actions and despite the operational complexity of these actions maintained Allstate brand property liability policies in force. We'll take you through a reconciliation of the various components of this and you'll see the path to growth. We've made excellent progress in expanding protection offered to customers with total policies in force increasing by 20.5% to nearly 176 million. We took advantage of the decline in auto accident frequency and our cost reductions to improve our competitive price position in auto insurance while maintaining attractive returns. The acquisition of National General is expected to increase auto insurers market share by 1 percentage point in 2021 and provides another platform for growth as we expand its product breadth. These changes position Allstate have sustainable long term growth. At the same time, Allstate generated strong profitability and returns in 2020. Net income was $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter and adjusted net income was $1.8 billion or $5.87 per diluted share. This was driven by lower frequency of auto accident, continued strong profitability of homeowners insurance and higher performance based investment income. Net income was $5.5 billion and adjusted net income was $4.6 billion for the year. This represents a 19.8% return on equity far in excess of most insurance companies. Our strategy is to increase market share in personal property liability while expanding protection services to customers will increase shareholder value. Higher property liability growth with attractive returns, rapidly growing protection services expand our total addressable market. And this growth, combined with our proactive capital deployment strategy, supports returns on equity above the insurance industry and are comparable to the S&P 500. Slide 3 is there to touch base on the strategy and so we're not going to spend time on that. So let's move to Slide 4 and discuss this strategy as it relates to the property liability business. A transformative growth has become more than a [plan], it's about creating a business model, capabilities and culture that continually transform to deliver market share growth. This is done by focusing on the customer, expanding access and improving value. Expanding access includes all the ways customers choose to interact, exclusive agents directly through call centers to the web and independent agents. The largest part of this change was transitioning our exclusive agent and direct businesses that operate under the Allstate brand. This gave us the ability to lower costs, leverage scale and increase advertising. This transaction is successfully being implemented, and we achieved key milestones in 2020. We were pleased with new business growth from existing Allstate agents who remain key to serving our customers and growing. Property liability business from existing agents met our goals, except for the pandemic slowdown in March and April where, of course, nobody was buying anything, as we shifted commission to new sales from retention. We're testing new agent models with less real estate and more efficient service enabled by technology with the goal of having strong local personal relationships with customers. These models will also create learnings to enable existing agents to achieve higher growth. As a result of that, we did stop appointing new Allstate agents in early 2020 while a higher growth in lower cost models being developed. This had a negative impact on points of presence and new business sales. At the same time, we increased direct sales. The net was that overall policies in force remained the same through the transition despite a drop in retention, which was concurrent with the ending of the special payment plans related to the pandemic. Glenn will take you through that reconciliation in a couple of minutes. The acquisition of National General in January also improves growth prospects. And as you know, this is essentially a reverse merger. The National General team is joining Allstate and they're consolidating our independent agent businesses, encompassing AIA into their operational and technology platform. Then we're going to be able to broaden National General's product portfolio using Allstate standard auto and homeowners insurance capabilities, which will create growth through independent agents. We also made great progress at improving customer value last year. From a customer value standpoint, we've maintained attractive margins through cost reductions while investing in growth. This includes improving the competitive price position of auto insurance through targeted rate reductions and a direct pricing discount. And while most of these changes are due to the lower frequency of auto actions, we are also reducing cost to ensure we continue to generate attractive margins. We're also expanding our industry leading telematics offerings, Drivewise and Milewise, to further improve our value proposition and improving its pricing expectations. We're the only company that major companies selling Milewise, which is very attractive to customers today because they're not driving as much. Our goal is not just to execute this plan but to continually generate transformational growth. We have the brand, market position, resources, capabilities and strategy to deliver this for shareholders. An extensive Allstate agent platform delivers more value per dollar to customers and competitors; a direct business utilizing the Allstate brand, competitive prices, broad product offerings and our insurance expertise; an independent agent business with national distribution and strong position in both auto and homeowners insurance; and protection services with innovative business models and expanding total addressable markets. We're well on our way to achieving this goal after putting the foundational elements into place last year. Let's move to Slide 4 to discuss Allstate's excellent financial performance in 2020. Revenues of $12 billion in the fourth quarter increased 4.8% to the prior year quarter, with total revenues for the year reaching $44.8 billion, which is primarily driven by higher premiums earned, which is partially offset then by lower net investment income. Net income was $2.6 billion for the fourth quarter and $5.5 billion for the full year 2020. Adjusted net income was $1.8 billion or $5.87 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted net income increased to $4.6 billion or $14.73 per diluted share. We had strong profitability in both auto and homeowners insurance. Adjusted net income return on equity is 19.8% over the last 12 months, exceeding our range of 14% to 17%, which is near the top of the insurance industry. Now I'll turn it over to Glenn to discuss the transition of the property liability businesses to higher growth. Glenn Shapiro : Thanks, Tom. Let's go to Slide 6. We'll discuss how Allstate is increasing property liability market share while maintaining attractive returns. With the foundational work completed in 2020, Allstate is positioned to grow market share in '21 while developing a leading position in all three primary distribution channels in property liability. Some of the actions taken in '20 have impacted growth in the near term but they were critical to advancing transformative growth in the longer term. Starting with Allstate exclusive agents who serve customers that value local advice and relationships, we're focused on accelerating growth and improving efficiency. Allstate agents continue to be a core strength of our organization. We're further strengthening that model by focusing on new business growth and lowering costs by improving marketing effectiveness, centralizing customer services and enhancing customer connectivity. Leveraging Esurance's direct capabilities under the Allstate brand, we've created an omnichannel experience that meets the customer where, how and when they want to interact with us. We completed the integration of direct processes and systems in 2020 and expect direct sold business to continue to accelerate. As Tom mentioned, National General is another exciting growth platform for us. I mean National General's independent agent facing technology, it's among the best in the industry and then our combined agency footprint covers the vast majority of the US market. So as we expand products on the National General platform, we're going to be in a position to grow share in the IA channel. The totality of this go to market model with strong capabilities in each distribution channel is designed to generate higher growth. Allstate's leading pricing and claims capabilities, including our strength in telematics, puts us in a strong competitive position. We're also enhancing our price competitiveness while maintaining attractive returns. The impact of the pandemic on miles driven and lower costs for auto losses gave us an opportunity to improve auto affordability through targeted rate reductions. We've also lowered underwriting expenses, as Tom mentioned. They're down 1.9 points over the last two years when excluding restructuring and coronavirus related expenses. These efficiencies and continued cost structure reductions allow us to improve pricing relative to competitors while generating excellent returns. Allstate has a strong record of profitability across lines of business and in different market conditions. The average combined ratio in auto insurance over the last five years was 94.4, and that excludes, obviously, 2020 results, which were influenced by the pandemic. We're equally strong at homeowners, where we averaged a combined ratio of 89.5 over the last five years. And that reflects the higher cost of capital or the higher capital requirements, I should say, in homeowners product versus auto. The point is we expect to grow and we expect to earn really attractive returns. So let's go to Slide 7, and we're going to discuss National General, the acquisition in a little more detail. On January 4th, Allstate closed the $4 billion acquisition of National General. We are incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead with National General and how this advances our strategy to grow personal lines. And it gives us an estimated increase of over 1 percentage point of total personal property liability market share. Allstate is now a top five personal lines carrier in the IA channel with significantly better competitive position. We utilize National General as our independent agent platform by consolidating our encompass and Allstate independent agency operations into the new entity, which will be branded National General and Allstate company. We expect to grow by rolling out new standard auto and homeowners insurance offerings starting later this year and completing countrywide deployment in less than two years. Consistent with past acquisitions, we've developed measures of success and we're showing those in the bottom of this slide. First, we expect the acquisition to be accretive with growing earnings, adding to returns and total profit. Second, we expect to achieve synergies by consolidating the three IA channel businesses into one, improving our competitive position. Third, we'll grow IA channel policies in force by broadening the product offering to fully meet customer needs for auto, home, other personal lines and from nonstandard to middle market to mass affluent. We'll continue to provide updates on our success in this channel as we report our National General brand results in the first quarter. Moving to Slide 8, let's go deeper into how we've strengthened Allstate branded property liability distribution. As we said before, some of the actions we took in 2020 negatively impacted near term growth while accelerating it in other areas. We supported Allstate agents to increase new business growth in 2020 with the exception of March and April, the beginning of the pandemic when things slowed down. At the same time, we stopped appointing new Allstate agents while higher growth and lower cost models are being developed, and that had a negative impact on new business. And as Tom mentioned earlier, we expect the new models are going to create learnings that enable our existing agents to achieve higher growth too. The chart on the lower left breaks down Allstate's personal auto new business applications compared to the prior year. If you exclude the declines in March and April due to the pandemic, Allstate brand new business increased with an improving trajectory throughout the year. The red bar on the far left of the chart shows the estimated unfavorable impact of the pandemic on new business in March and April. Moving to the right, you can see the negative impact of stopping new agent appointments during 2020, but that was partially offset by an increase in existing EA production. And that shows the viability of growth with those existing agents when we just made a slight compensation change towards new business from renewal. They just have a great opportunity to grow. Moving to the center of the chart. The total direct channel increased compared to prior year, and this is the combined Allstate and Esurance view. And it's because Allstate brand direct applications more than offset the decline in Esurance brand, that reflects the redirection of branding investments and resources from Esurance to Allstate brand. We expect continued growth in the direct channel as we optimize web and call center sales capabilities. A relatively small number of independent agents operate under the Allstate brand and had a small positive impact on overall growth but a really nice percentage increase among that group. And it highlights the growth opportunity we have going forward in the IA channel as we transition those appointments to National General over time, expand National General's product offerings upmarket and endorse the brand as an Allstate company. The overall Allstate and Esurance policies in force maintained prior year levels in 2020 as we manage through significant change in our operating model and had a small decrease in retention levels, which you can see all of that in the lower right. Total property liability policies in force declined slightly driven by the Encompass brand, which will be integrated in the National General's platform in 2021. Now I'll turn it over to Mario to discuss the rest of our quarterly results. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Glenn. Let's turn to Slide 9 to discuss the performance of our property liability business. Property liability results remained strong with excellent recorded and underlying profitability. Net written premium declined in the fourth quarter by 1.5%. While homeowners premium grew 3.2% from the prior year quarter due to average premium and policy growth, this was more than offset by a modest decline in auto insurance premiums, driven by premium refunds. Underwriting income of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter and $4.4 billion for the full year increased relative to the prior year by $420 million and $1.6 billion respectively. As shown in the chart on the lower left, the recorded combined ratio of 84 in the fourth quarter improved 4.7 points compared to the prior year. This improvement was primarily attributable to a lower underlying loss ratio in auto insurance, driven by fewer auto accidents, partially offset by higher auto insurance claim severity and a slightly adverse underlying loss ratio in homeowners insurance compared to prior year. Homeowners continues to generate attractive returns with a recorded combined ratio of 78.5 in the fourth quarter and 90 for the full year 2020. Additionally, the underlying combined ratio performance has consistently achieved our low 60s target, which speaks to our expertise in managing this business. Favorable underlying loss ratios were partially offset by higher catastrophe losses along with restructuring charges related to transformative growth. The underwriting expense ratio improved 0.2 points compared to the prior year quarter, which reflects a 0.6 point improvement in the expense ratio, excluding restructuring costs, partially offset by 0.4 points of restructuring. As you can see from the chart on the bottom right, when excluding restructuring charges and impacts from actions taken as a result of coronavirus, the expense ratio improved 1 point in 2020 and 1.9 points over the past two years, demonstrating continued progress toward the goal of reducing our cost structure to maintain returns while improving the competitive price position of auto insurance. Shifting to Slide 10. Let's discuss protection services, which were formerly known as our service businesses. Protection Services revenues, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses, increased 17.5% to $497 million in the fourth quarter, reaching $1.9 billion for the full year. Allstate Protection plans continued to deliver significant growth, ending the year with nearly $1 billion in revenue. Policies in force increased 28.6% to $136 million, driven by Allstate Protection plans. As shown in the table on the bottom right, adjusted net income was $38 million in the fourth quarter and $153 million for the full year, representing increases compared to the prior year of $35 million and $115 million respectively. The increase in both periods was driven by growth of Allstate Protection plans and improved profitability at Allstate Roadside Services. Now let's turn to Slide 11, which highlights investment performance for the fourth quarter. The chart on the left shows net investment income totaled nearly $1.2 billion in the quarter, which was $502 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance based income. Performance based income totaled $557 million in the fourth quarter, as shown in gray, primarily from higher private equity valuations and gains from sales of underlying investments. Market based income, shown in blue, was $63 million below the prior year quarter. With lower interest rates, our reinvestment rates remain below the average interest bearing portfolio yield, reducing income. GAAP total returns are shown in the table on the right. Our 2020 portfolio return totaled 7.1%, reflecting income generation and higher fixed income and public equity valuations. Our performance based investment return was 7% for the quarter and 4.9% for the full year. Our performance based strategy has a longer term investment horizon and higher but more volatile return expectations compared to the market based portfolio. The compound annual rate of return on the performance based portfolio is 8.8% over the past five years, as shown in the bottom right of the table, exceeding the market based portfolio return by 330 basis points. Let's move now to Slide 12 and review results for Allstate Life, Benefits and Annuities. Allstate Life, shown on the left, recorded adjusted net income of $56 million in the fourth quarter, $20 million below the prior year, primarily driven by higher contract benefits as coronavirus death claims totaled approximately $30 million in the quarter. Allstate Benefits adjusted net income of $34 million in the fourth quarter was $18 million higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting lower benefit utilization, likely due to the coronavirus and the nonrenewal of a large underperforming account in 2019. Allstate Annuities had adjusted net income of $160 million in the fourth quarter, attributable to strong investment income generated from the performance based portfolio. Starting in the first quarter of this year, the majority of the Allstate Life and Annuities business will be classified as held for sale on our balance sheet and results will be presented as discontinued operations following our recently announced agreement to sell Allstate Life Insurance company. Now let's move to Slide 13, which highlights Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate continued to generate returns that are among the highest in the insurance industry with an adjusted net income return on equity of 19.8%. Excellent capital management and strong cash flows have enabled Allstate to return cash to shareholders while simultaneously investing in growth, a capital deployment strategy which leads to increased shareholder value. Investing in growth opportunities remains a priority, as evidenced by our investments in building higher growth models and completing the $4 billion acquisition of National General. We also continue to provide cash returns to shareholders. In September, Allstate executed a $750 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. And upon completion on January 12, $1.45 billion remains on the $3 billion common share repurchase authorization, which we expect to complete by the end of 2021. We returned $2.4 billion to common shareholders in 2020 through a combination of $1.7 billion in share repurchases and $668 million in common stock dividends. Last week, we announced the pending sale of Allstate Life Insurance company which will enable us to redeploy up to $2.2 billion of capital out of lower growth and return businesses with minimal impact to our two part strategy. With that context, let's open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. JoshShanker: One thing that really didn't get expressed maybe you can talk about is the extent to which we're seeing buydowns to like pay per mile products and whatnot, or unbundling is going on that you're keeping the homeowners and not the auto. To what extent is it customer being shrinking their wallet with Allstate taking place in this transition? TomWilson: Josh, this is Tom. I'll start and then get Glenn to talk a little bit about Milewise and our success there. First, we don't really see an unbundling. I know you mentioned that in your report. Our actually bundling percentage went up. That doesn't mean that it's not happening and we just don't see it, but we're seeing our bundling actually go up, as it relates to the buying down and sort of getting lower average premium. I think what you're seeing is through telematics is more accurate prices, the way I would describe it. And so if you look at the total revenues we take in and then what we pay out, we, as Glenn showed, consistently made money in auto insurance for a long period of time. That will change by customer. So if somebody gets Milewise and they only drive 2,000 miles a year and pay less, then there will be somebody else who will have to charge more. So we maintain that overall profitability. So we see it as a good thing that people get the most accurate price, particularly since we're more sophisticated than most of the industry, and we have some of the tools like telematics. Glenn, what would you add to either bundling or telematics? GlennShapiro: I think on the bundling side, I would look at as it actually -- I'd flip it the way Tom did there, we\u2019re actually seeing some increase in bundling, and I think that's helping our homeowners. So part of the story and the homeowners growth, it's only part because we got a lot of good parts of the story and homeowners there is bundling. In terms of Milewise and Drivewise, I'll talk about both of them, we definitely see increased demand. So right now, we have Milewise available to 45% of the market and we're continuing this year to roll out to more states. And we have Drivewise just about everybody is one state that doesn't allow it. But the demand for telematics has gone significantly up. Milewise, for example, admittedly a relatively small base, but was up 35% in terms of sales. So people are looking at the pandemic. They're not driving as much. We're advertising it a little bit. And we're getting a lot of people interested in the notion of pay by mile. From a Drivewise standpoint, most people really want to now include the telematics as part of their offering from us. So we're seeing a nice upswing on the demand post pandemic. JoshShanker: I'm going to try and digest all that and figure out how it works. If we can go to the slides you prepared on Page 8, you have this very interesting slide about new issued applications. I'm trying to understand it a little bit better. First of all, when it says Allstate brand direct submissions were up but Esurance was down. Is that four months of Allstate brand direct and eight months of Esurance? When we should think about that, that not only is Allstate brand bring in more customers than Esurance but it's a smaller time line. Is this the right way to think about that? TomWilson: No, those numbers are for the entire year. And what we're trying to show there is that we've successfully made the transition to the Allstate brand selling direct, both operationally, which wasn't simple, by the way, in terms of changing web flows and all kinds of other stuff. They're getting the branding changed and putting the price discount in if you buy direct under the Allstate brand because it doesn't come with an agent. So we've made that change. And what that shows is that overall, we grew. We did keep selling some under the Esurance brand those companies because they're open, people call, get on our Web site, they track their way down to it. So it's really low cost business. So we didn't completely shut off, Josh, the Esurance. So you can still buy. Over time, it will go away as we cut advertising it and quit doing and people could come into that Web site. So what it's really trying to show there is that we've made the turn indirect, and we feel good about our ability to operate under 1 brand, and there were many people who didn't think that was possible, whether that was perceived channel conflict or just operational capabilities. JoshShanker: And then on the EA channel part, a significant portion of annual new policies coming through the EA channel coming from new appointments? If we don't do a lot of new appointments going forward, should we expect that's a multiyear issue in terms of growth in the EA channel? TomWilson: I don't think you should think it's a multiyear issue. Obviously, Glenn mentioned we are working on creating some new higher growth models, and he can talk you through that in a second here. The part that may not be as obvious is putting Allstate agents onboarding with the old model, the commissions were substantially higher than you pay to an existing agent. And the idea being if you open an office and you got nobody coming in you sell the first policy, you need to make some money, and the commissions were quite high there. What Glenn is working on is coming up with a model where an agent can build the business and be successful without us having to incur the additional cost upfront to build it, which kind of rolled out over three to five years, it was expensive. And so what we thought -- what we made was the economic choice, which was save shareholder money, don't keep investing in a model that you think you get a better one for and then make sure the existing agents continue to grow. Glenn, do you want to talk about the new agents and then what you've done with the existing agents as well? GlennShapiro: And I always want to emphasize on this. Our exclusive agents are a huge strategic advantage for us and a core capability for Allstate. As much as we talk about and I'm excited about the direct growth and what we can do in the independent agent channel, a large, large channel out there and a lot of customers really like to go to a local agent and a branded agent like an Allstate agent to go there. So it's a great model for us and we want those agents to keep winning. So what we've done with existing agents is, as you know, we've shifted compensation a little bit, we've motivated more on the new business side than just on the renewal side. But we're also working with them on the way we market. We're putting more money into marketing. We really want them to be successful. From a new agent standpoint, we've got a few models in market right now. And without going too detailed into it, the general theme would be, if you think about the virtual world we're operating in, can you have a local agent that doesn't really require brick and mortar? And we think the answer is yes to that. That there's an opportunity for agents to be a local point of sale, people who are active in the community, people who have relationships locally and sell through those relationships in their communities, but don't necessarily have a staff and have a brick and mortar office where we perform the back end service in a more centralized way. It's a significantly lower cost model to get started, as Tom mentioned, and one that we're pretty bullish on our ability to scale. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. GregPeters: My first question is around price and competitive positioning. Obviously, we're listening to when watching the new products that you're rolling out the product enhancements and the focus on profitable growth. Your underlying combined ratio for the year is 79.3% is obviously a very excellent result. But do you think that your price for your Allstate brand auto is competitive in the marketplace considering how profitable the business is at the moment? TomWilson: The answer is yes. That we think we can be even more competitive. It's a complicated question, of course, because with billions of price points, and some segments you're not competitive at all because you don't want to be competitive because you think that somebody else is under charging and other places you want to be competitive. And the trick is where you want to be competitive, to be competitive enough to win the business but not so competitive that you're giving away margin. And so we have a very sophisticated approach of doing that. We do think that we can change our pricing so we can be more competitive overall. But yes, we look at our close rates and we're right in the market. And that depends how we carry ourself too. So if you look at us versus other people who have exclusive agents [Technical Difficulty] in general, we're very competitive. If you look at us versus direct, I'd say we're less so, which is why we made the change to put in a direct discount on that business. So we are more competitive because people are not getting an agent, they don't want to pay for one. So I would say we're highly competitive. That said, I think we can always be better. And when you look at what drives customers\u2019 purchase price, a lot of it's the price, now you got to make sure you make enough money. And that's the trick. Glenn, anything you would add to that? GlennShapiro: Just a couple of things, I'll hit there. One would be, you mentioned, Tom, that close rates, like so we keep a really close eye and our close rates and our close rates have improved. Our new business is up. I mean you look at -- you're talking, Greg, auto but I'll say, auto and home, we were up 2% and 8% respectively, between on new business. So folks are buying the product and you really can't sell the product if you're out of the market from a competitive standpoint. So those are good signs that we are, but we're working to get more competitive. And the last point I'll make with it is, I always go back to this. We manage state by state. We have a talented group of state managers that like they've got their hands on the lever in each state and they're looking at the competitive position, specifically in that market. And as Tom said, on which types of business are we more or less competitive on younger drivers, older drivers, homeowners, not homeowners, married, not married all, all the different components in there, and they're pulling those levers and getting us as competitive as we can be while earning attractive returns. GregPeters: I'd like to pivot to the expense ratio. I think the chart you put on Slide 9 of your presentation and very strong improvement from 2018 to 2019 to 2020. So two part questions with the result and then going forward. How much of the 23.2 is benefited from reduced T&E because of lockdown? Or look at a different way, I know you've been focused on integrated services platform and other tools. Is it an expectation that you can drive further improvement in '21 and the expense ratio? TomWilson: So Mario has been our lead on cost reduction. Mario, do you want to take that? MarioRizzo: When you look at the expense ratio for the year and the improvements we made, we came into the year really focused on taking cost out of two principal areas. One was acquisition related costs and the other one was operating costs, which your T&E component is a part of that but those are people related costs and operations and those types of items. And that's really what's driven the improvement, once you take the noise of restructuring and pandemic related costs out of the equation. The improvement we've seen this year has really come from those two principal areas. We've actually spent a little more on marketing, like we said we would as well, but our reductions in those two areas have really created the space for us to increase our growth related investments. As we go forward, as we've said on past calls, our focus is on continuing to drive our cost structure down because it is a core part of our growth strategy. It's how we're going to be able to continue to improve our competitive positioning in terms of auto insurance pricing and continuing to deliver really attractive returns. So that's a core part of our strategy and our focus is to continue to drive that ratio down. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. DavidMotemaden: Just a question, and I believe on one of the slides, you had just talked about how you had 94.4 average combined ratio in the auto business over the last five years excluding 2020. Obviously, 2020 is an abnormal year. But is that sort of a level you're comfortable getting back to in order to return to growth? And I guess, what sort of level are you willing to let that go to in order to accelerate growth? TomWilson: I think I would go up all the way up to the top and say that what we said is we can grow the market share on personal property liability and as a company we'll deliver 14% to 17% return on equity. And we believe that will drive lots of shareholder value, both in terms of economic value creation and valuation multiples. When you look specifically at the components of that, we have a headwind in investment income with low interest rates. We do have and have had for a long time great profitability in auto insurance. We would have put a longer period of time in there, but the pension accounting kind of changed the way we did it. But we've been earning great returns in the auto insurance business for a long time and expect to continue. At a 94, you still earn a really attractive return on equity because you don't have to put up as much capital on that line and some other lines. And so 94 would be the book -- we like to make as much money as we can and grow as fast as we can, and it's really about how do you drive net present value to the whole company. So we don't publish and have a target of safety there. But 94 would be a return I would be highly comfortable with. I'd be comfortable at 93, I'd be comfortable with 95. They're all really great returns. The other part to focus on is homeowners insurance where that's a higher capital return business and so we have a lower combined ratio there. And we're 10 to 15 points better than another large public competitor, which is somewhere between $700 million and $1 billion a year of profit. So we think all of those then add up to 14% to 17% return. So we're comfortable we can grow the business and earn good returns. And it will bounce around, as you mentioned this year, frequency went way down. So we made a bunch more money. If frequency goes back up, we'll just have to raise our prices up. And the question is are you good at it. And the point of putting those two statistics on the bottom of that page was just to give our shareholders comfort that we have a history of managing returns and profitability, and we expect to continue to do it. Not going to be the same every year because the world changes but we know how to make money. DavidMotemaden: And I guess just maybe switching gears a little bit to the new appointed agents, and thanks for the slide on Slide 8, that was very helpful. Some encouraging trends there. I guess I just wanted to ask on the new agents and appointments. Do you expect that to still be a drag in '21 or is that something that will turn from a drag to an addition to new apps and to growth? Or is that something that you expect to still be a little bit of a drag as these new models ramp up? Tom Wilson : I'll make some overall comments, and then Glenn, you may want to make some comments. First, I would say that when you do these year-over-year comparisons and sometimes I feel like the external view of the company, you just look one year. And so next year, obviously, we won't have had them much for this year. So I would actually be a negative versus the prior year. That said, I think the transition of Allstate agents to higher growth and lower cost will have some bumps in it. That said, as you see, when the people we focus on, the existing agents that are doing well, they know how to grow. They know their local market, their aggressive salespeople, they have aggressive salespeople working for them. And so I don't know that it's as simple as like that's now gone and we get the new one. The new one we think should add additional volume for us, and Glenn can talk about how that will roll out. And then at the same time, the beauty of our strategy is as direct grows it keeps our advertising money highly effective because if we're not closing enough because through some agent changes, we can close more in direct. So we have a fallback. We don't think we need it but we got plenty of opportunity to balance between those. Glenn, do you want to talk about the -- I think the view is on the agents, we have a ways to go to actually figure it all out, but we're making good progress. GlennShapiro: I think if you think about that chart and you look across at the direct part, too, I think it's a similar story. I think 2020 is a story really good success. We've built the foundation in that year and actually managed to grow more on the Allstate side than we lost on the Esurance side. And so that's sort of an ideal scenario that while you're in the midst of the muck and the mire of making a change like that, that you actually are able to grow it. We absolutely are making that type of change within the EA system. As we've said, we've got a lot of agents out there that are phenomenal at what they do and they grow and we're going to invest with them and have them be successful, then we have a new model upcoming. I think the way to look at this is to across all three channels. With EAs, we will ramp up some time later this year some new models and through next year. And so there's that coming as well as work with the existing EAs that really know how to grow. With direct, we've really done a lot of the heavy lifting of making the transition and we should be able to continue to grow, and we're very confident in our ability to continue to grow it. With IA, which is really, for all intents and purposes, a bit of a new channel for us. I know we've had Encompass in the small Allstate independent agents in there. But really jumping into the top five will start like the first state will roll out in the third quarter of this year with new products going upmarket on the National General platform, National General and Allstate company platform, and then multiple states per month and like we'll be finished with the rollout across all 50 states through 2022. So you can kind of see all of these things coming together, and we're building a long term and sustainable growth platform across all of the channels. DavidMotemaden: And I think the new agent, the new EA agent strategy is -- I mean, it sounds actually really promising. I guess one question I have is, are those new agents -- I guess, the more remote exclusive agent, are they as productive as under the old brick and mortar model? TomWilson: I would say we don't know yet. But we do think it will be lower cost, if you want to look at it that way. You might have to have more people doing it. And then, David, you get a little bit of math because the existing agents also have salespeople in their office. So when you do it by agent but then these people might be so low producers. So net-net, we think we know over half the people want to buy from a person and having a person local is good. It's just the way we've traditionally done it hasn't given us as much growth and it's costs don't need to be as high as they are today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. MichaelPhillips: You guys mentioned the impact on the end of the payment plans and the pandemic and retention and growth in the quarter. I guess, Part A of this, is there any way to quantify that? And what I want to get at is, if so, how much -- given that the EA is still in the bulk of your business, how much of was there a drag on retention because of things that you're doing with commissions and emphasis on direct and everything else that's going on? So can we quantify that impact, one and then how much of an impact if everything else was on retention? TomWilson: Well, Glenn can give you some detailed specifics on the year. Of course, retention is always hard to figure out, because you have a bunch of stuff going on, you have people changing lifestyle, not driving as much, some people shopping more, you have competitive moves, you have things that we did like shelter in place, payback and payment plan forgiveness -- not forgiveness, we just let you defer. And so as those things roll through the system, it's hard to do attribution on it. That said, it was down this year, which of course we're focused on. Our Net Promoter Score really peaked throughout the year. We got peaked in about July when we were doing all the shelter in place paybacks, it came down a little bit towards the end of the year, but not anything of any consequence or significance. Glenn, do you want to make a comment about the actual retention numbers? GlennShapiro: Yes. I don't know I can add a lot to what you said, Tom. I think you hit it well. I mean the retention is in a decent range right now. So it's off of our highs that we hit. But we're within a long term window on retention of where we've operated and certainly, all the things that Tom mentioned had a drag on it. We know that the coming due of special payment plans had some drag on it, and the competitive environment. We know that there were some competitors out there that took some rate down. We also know that people facing financial hardship either shop, some people even give up a car. So all of those things have some play in it. And as you said, Tom, the attribution is next to impossible on that. But we're within a decent range of our long term retention and we're focused on it. And of course, we want to retain every customer that we work hard to get in the first place. TomWilson: And I think if -- the underlying question there was are existing agents performing well enough to keep retention levels up or somehow made a mat or something like that, our answer there would be no. We don't see anything in there that says that existing agents are doing anything that they haven't done before, that they're not stepping up and helping their customers even more in the pandemic. I mean they really reached out tons of calls on shelter in place and the payment plans and that kind of stuff. So our agents were doing a great job. I don't think there's anything structurally in there as it relates to this transition that says we're not -- and I would point out that, that's a huge part of agent compensation. So their interests are aligned with our interest, which is keeping our customers happy. MichaelPhillips: Second question, still on kind of channel mix, near term and longer term question. In the near term, I guess, just this year, you talked about a 1 point change in market share. Should we expect that to be kind of even throughout the year or more back half weighted in terms of that market share shift? And then longer term, more interested in maybe 10 years down the road, what does Allstate look like? How does this mix look, a third, a third, a third or something still weighted towards EA and IA? TomWilson: We closed National General on January 4th. So that in and of itself means we'll get that revenue for the entire year. So you should expect to see total auto premiums go up throughout the year. We would expect that as we continue to roll out things in the Allstate brand that we start to see some more growth in that business over time. And yes, but we don't really give it out even do it by quarter, just as much as you can. In terms of the long term, we'll take anybody we can get. So we have one out of 10. We still got nine out of 10 to go. I'd be happy if all of them got a lot bigger and that's what we're setting up to do. So we don't have a percentage. When you look at percentages from what customers want, it's probably today, 25% of the customers really prefer self serve and it's a range. If you look at those who want an agent, it's over 50% and usually around 65% or about 60%. And then in between, you have people who are sort of -- they go with whatever is in front of them and they're indifferent. So we think there's plenty of opportunity to grow. Some of the shift you see in channels is really due to customers wanting it differently, like not feeling like they need help to buy the product. Some of the shift is just because direct companies have been advertising more. So you all loud enough and people come to you. So we think what we should do is give people exactly what they want, give them choice. And what they want with the person is really to help buy it. They need and want less help on service. And so the existing insurance agent businesses have been built on both. What we're trying to focus on is really helping them buy and then give them self serve or have computers do it or whatever to lower the cost on the service side because it's cheaper, better and faster. So we don't need to do as much local service as we do. So we'll take as many people as we can get through any channel. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. PaulNewsome: I was hoping you could maybe help us understand a little bit more about how the investment portfolio will look after the life sale? Will the P&C business kind of have a little bit of a different mix of assets and will that have an impact on the yield as well? TomWilson: Paul, let me give you a slight overview from a corporate standpoint, and John can talk about the specifics. So obviously, the sale of Allstate Life Insurance company substantially reduces our investment portfolio as we exit a spread-based business. And the [Indiscernible] entity is taking almost all the assets that are used to asset liability match that business. They are not taking all of the performance based assets. So that increases the percentage relative to the overall portfolio, which also gets smaller. And we looked at it, obviously, prior to the sale. We're comfortable with the risk and return of it. You will remember that we reduced our equity holdings in February this year by $4 billion, not because of the Allstate Life sale but because we just didn't like the risk and return profile there. So we do make changes up and down. And this will still have the ability to go up and down even though this portion of the portfolio is less liquid than the public equity as a whole because we still have public equities we get high yields. We have a bunch of ways we can manage the overall risk of the portfolio, and we're very comfortable with where we'll be. John, do you want to talk specifically about [performance] basis? JohnDugenske: When you look at performance space, too, it's part of a broader overall portfolio context. So while that percentage will go up, we look across risk and return factors across every security and every investment we hold and take it in its entirety. So as Tom mentioned, we have a lot of ways to compensate for additional risk we may take in one area. When you look at the performance space, this is a long term holding for us, we've looked at gradually growing that over multiple years. And in some ways, this just accelerates that gradual path that we're on. As we built this portfolio, we've always looked for the best partners and the best direct investments we can across private equity, real estate and other areas. And the assets that we'd be bringing on board are ones that we're already very familiar with. We already own them, obviously, and very familiar. So it accelerates our path forward in a way that we're quite comfortable with. And, I guess, I\u2019d just finish by saying that the return on this has stood up quite well even in what's been a volatile year. We've been looking back at what our returns have been over the last five years and 10 years, and our performance based assets have fared quite well relative to public markets, and we think that it continues to be an integral part of the portfolio. TomWilson: Jonathan, let's take one last question and then we'll wrap up to keep people on time. Operator : Our final question for today then comes from the line of Gary Ransom from Dowling & Partners. GaryRansom: I wanted to loop back on telematics. You mentioned increased demand for the product. A couple of questions there. Did that make any material difference to the growth in new business that you're seeing that roll forward you showed on Slide 8? And then secondly, whether the difference between your by the mile product and the standard product, whether the demand is different. And with that question, I'm really just trying to think ahead is to buy the mile product more the way of the future. TomWilson: Gary, let me make a couple of comments. First, I don't believe it's actually driven people to us. So I think with our advertising when they get to us, and then we talk to them about it, so that's interesting. And what it enables us to is give them a more accurate price, which protects them competitively. So the more accurate the price they are -- if someone takes them away from us, and we're really accurate through a lower price, then they'll we think, lose money. And we won't lose people because we're overpriced for the risk. So it will drive more sustainability to growth as opposed to people calling us and saying, hey, I want to. That doesn't mean people don't see our ads and say, geez, I'm tired of paying this much for insurance, and I hardly drive sort cost. But I'm not seeing a big well spring of people saying cost, it tends to be more in the sale itself. In terms of a long-term basis, I think this is the way that pricing will be done. I mean insurers for a long time have been trying to get more and more accurate on the individual risk, particularly in auto insurance and home insurance for that matter, of course, going to telematics here. But as credit was a big move, I don't know, 15 or 20 years ago when we first got into that using stuff out of the credit file and is very powerful. This is very powerful, as powerful, not so much in the fat part of the curve, they're being moderate risk people. But in really low risk or really high risk people, it's very effective. So I think it will lead to more sustainable growth through better retention because we'll have a really accurate and competitive price. GaryRansom: Can you also talk a little bit about how you might be using telematics on the claims side, whether that is developing or having much effect at this point? TomWilson: Glenn, do you want to take that? GlennShapiro: So we've got some capability there that is, I would call it, developing. And it's about accident notification. And I think this is -- Tom talked about it being the wave of the future for pricing, which I totally agree with from the telematics. I think it's going to be the wave of the future. When you think about connected cars, you think about our devices in OBD ports or even the mobile, there's accident detection through Arity through the mobile telematics. So early notification, emergency notification, first notice of loss taking are all areas in development, and I think will be a wave of the future. TomWilson: Gary, I would expand on that and say, if you go to digital claims settlement, we believe we've been leading the industry, whether that's a quick photo claim, whether that's using algorithms to look at pictures and decide how you should settle the claim. I know another company is talking about going into a SPAC and raising some money. We've worked extensively with that company. We think our platform, our technology and the ability to utilize data will make us even better at settling claims. So it's not really related to telematics but it's really related to digitization of the business, which is another way that we're trying to change both our business model and really our culture, with just to drive that kind of growth. So thank you all for participating. We are trying to build really transformational growth business models. It's more than a plan. It's really a way of life. And we expect to deliver increased growth and earn good returns, which will both create economic value just because we make more money and should lead to higher valuation multiples. Thank you much. We'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mark Nogal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Nogal : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate\u2019s first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release, investor supplement and posted related materials on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements. So please refer to our 10-K for 2020 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Thanks, Mark. Good morning everybody. We appreciate you making the time to follow-up on Allstate to see how we're doing. Let's start on Slide 2. On the left our strategy has two components, which is to increase personal property liability market share, and then secondly, to expand protection services, which are shown in those two logos. And we made substantial progress in executing that this quarter. Many of those things that we'll talk about on the right-hand side, were really a year plus in the making, but you see it all coming together this quarter. So, we closed on the acquisition National General in January enhancing our competitive position in the independent agent distribution. We executed agreement to sell Allstate Life Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company at New York, two separate deals there and that will redeploy capital out of the lower growth and return businesses and reduces our exposure to interest rate risk. We also can make continued progress on getting higher growth in our personal property liability business, moving into Phase 3 of Transformative Growth. Total revenues increased by 26.2% at quarter, which is an outstanding number. Policies in force increased by 20.6%. And of course, that's driven in large part by the National General acquisition. And we'll talk a little bit more about that in the call. A long-term approach to creating shareholder value in both investing and using reinsurance also benefited results this quarter. We hit substantial increase in performance-based income and reinsurance recoveries. Allstate Protection Plans continues its rapid growth. We launched Home Depot earlier this quarter. We had strong operating results with adjusted net income of $1.9 billion or $6.11 a share and it generated a return on equity over the last 12 months of 23.2%. And then shareholders also benefited with a $765 million of dividends in share repurchases. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 3 and go through the first quarter financial results. Our revenues of $12.5 billion in the quarter increased 26.2% to the prior year quarter. And that reflects both the National General acquisition, higher investment income and realized capital gains. Property-liability premiums earned and policies in force increased by 11.4% and 12.1% respectively. Our performance-based income was $378 million versus a loss in the first quarter of 2020. We did have a net loss of $1.4 billion that was recorded in a quarter, which there was a $4 billion loss on the dispositions on those announced sales of the two life insurance companies. And that was not fully offset by the strong operating performance. The strong operating performance charter did create that adjusted net income of about $1.9 billion, as you can see from the table on the bottom. And that's 55.7% higher than the prior year quarter as reduced auto claim frequency and higher net investment income, more than offset increased catastrophe losses. Let's go to Slide 4 digging a little on National General, which is an excellent growth platform for us. We acquired the business for $4 billion in January and that's to grow market share within the independent agent channel. And National General has appointments with over 42,000 independent agents. That expands our product portfolio as well includes non-standard auto insurance, where we had a very small presence, lender-placed homeowners insurance, accident and health insurance and two digital marketing platforms. National General\u2019s agency-facing technology is effective, efficient and scalable. So we're a better owner for National General, since it improves the independent agent business, it lowers costs and it will generate incremental growth from here. It will become a top five independent agent carrier.  And then the combination of Allstate's standard auto and homeowners insurance expertise with National General's expertise in non-standard auto insurance, will give us a really broad portfolio of products to provide to independent agents. Significant expense reductions are expected by consolidating Allstate\u2019s to independent agent businesses onto National General's technology and operating platform. And the cost to acquire these in force policies, which is about one point of our market share at the net acquisition price is comparable to doing this organically. Now we have three measures of success through these acquisitions. You can see in the bottom of the table, accretion to earnings, achieve expense synergies and grow IA channel policies in force. We\u2019re only a quarter into it, but we had a really strong start on these goals. We put Glenn and the team, [indiscernible] have been working on this really since the six months we started the deal in July six months before we bought it. So we came into this first quarter with a head of steam. And the Allstate protection segment added $1.3 billion in net written premiums, $138 million in underwriting income this quarter. Allstate Health and Benefits increase adjusted net income by $35 million. We are integrating Encompass onto the National General platform and are on pace to achieve our expense synergies. We also expect to grow policies enforced by broadening that product portfolio in IA channel. And of course, that represents about a third of the total person lines market. The IA channel policies in force are approximately six times larger after this transaction, as we add standard auto and homeowners insurance products to National General\u2019s offering later this year that will drive even more growth. Let me now turn it over to Mario to go through the first quarter results in more detail. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Tom. And good morning everybody. Let's go to Slide five and delve a little deeper into Property Liability growth. Property Liability policies in force grew by 12.1%, compared to the prior year quarter. National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of 3.9 million policies. The Allstate brand grew policies by 0.5% due to growth in homeowners and other personal lines as you can see by the table on the left. Allstate brand auto insurance was flat to the prior year, as increased new business was offset by lower retention. The chart on the lower right shows a breakdown of personal auto, new issued applications compared to the prior year, which increased 64% in total, primarily due to the incremental 526,000 applications generated by National General. The middle section of the chart shows Allstate brand impacts by channel, which in total generated a 5.4% increase in new business growth, compared to the prior year. Modest increases from existing agents and a large increase in direct channel sales, more than offset the volume that would normally have been generated by newly appointed agents, as we pilot new agent models with higher growth and lower costs. As a result, property liability net written premium grew 13.7% in the first quarter compared to prior year, driven by a 12.9% increase in auto insurance and a 20.3% increase in homeowners insurance. The auto insurance net written premium increase was driven by a 14.1% increase in policies in force due to National General and increased new business \u2013 new issued applications across all brands. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower average auto insurance premiums from approved rate decreases and lower retention, partially driven by the impact of special payment plans that were implemented during the pandemic. If you flip to Slide 6, you see property-liability margins remain strong. The recorded combined ratio of 83.3, improved 1.5 points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily from a lower underlying loss ratio driven by reduced auto frequency and continued cost savings. The auto insurance recorded combined ratio of 80.5, was 8.8 points below the prior year, primarily due to lower accident frequency in the quarter. Allstate brand auto property damage gross frequency remained below prior year levels in 47 of 51 geographies, which includes the District of Columbia. The chart on the lower left shows the impact of the pandemic on Allstate brand auto property damage gross frequency. As you can see the onset of the pandemic and efforts to slow the spread of the virus had a large impact on frequency beginning at the end of the first quarter of last year, and then extending into the second quarter when auto frequency was at its lows. This timeframe coincided with Allstate's shelter in place payback. Following the second quarter of 2020 property damage frequency has trended below pre-pandemic levels by approximately 28%, as you can see by the third and fourth quarter variances to 2019. And first quarter of 2021 frequency showed a comparable decline relative to 2019. As you can see from the chart on the bottom right, we continue to make progress in reducing our cost structure, enabling us to improve the competitive position of auto insurance, while maintaining strong returns. The property liability expense ratio improved 2.5 points in the first quarter of 2021, compared to the prior year due to the absence of coronavirus-related expenses incurred in 2020, such as the shelter in place payback as well as continued cost reductions. This was partially offset by a significant increase in advertising investment. The expense ratio, excluding coronavirus-related expenses, restructuring charges, and the amortization of purchased intangibles associated with the acquisition of National General was 22.8, an improvement of 0.5 points compared to the prior year quarter. In connection with the anticipated benefits associated with the future work environment, we expect to incur approximately $110 million in restructuring costs during 2021 with $33 million recognized in the first quarter, primarily related to real estate exit costs. These restructuring costs and their future benefits are incremental to the $290 million of aggregate restructuring costs related to transformative growth, which we announced in the third quarter of 2020 and of which we've recognized $256 million to date including $17 million this quarter. Let's move to Slide 7 to discuss our progress on building transformative growth business models. So transformative growth is a multi-year initiative to build a low cost digital insurer with broad distribution. This will be accomplished by expanding customer access, improving customer value, increasing marketing sophistication and investment and building new technology ecosystems. A longitudinal plan segments transformative growth into five phases, starting with the conceptual design and ending with the retirement of the old business model. We've completed Phase 1 and much of Phase 2. In Phase 2, the auto insurance competitive position has been improved leading to higher close rates. This was supported by cost reductions. Direct capabilities have been expanded and sales volumes are increasing. New branding has been launched and marketing investment has been increased. This combined with industry-leading telematics capabilities will increase growth. We believe Allstate is among the leaders in telematics and is the largest pay-per-mile provider through Milewise, which offers lower costs for customers who drive less. We've also expanded independent agent distribution through the National General acquisition. Looking forward, we are now into Phase 3 in building the new operating model. We will support the transition of Allstate agents to higher growth and lower cost models. New agent models are also being tested to serve customers who want a local agent. Improving customer acquisition costs relative to lifetime value will lower costs. Expense reductions will support increased investment in growth and technology. The new customer experience and product management technology ecosystems also get deployed in this phase. Now let's go to Slide 8, which highlights investment performance for the first quarter. Net investment income totaled $708 million in the quarter, which was $462 million above the prior year quarter driven by a higher performance based income as shown in the chart on the left. Performance-based income totaled $378 million in the first quarter as shown in gray, reflecting broad based valuation increases in private equity investments and sales of underlying real estate investments. Market-based income shown in blue was $6 million below the prior year quarter with lower interest rates, our reinvestment rates remain below the average interest bearing portfolio yield reducing income. Our first quarter GAAP total portfolio return was minus 0.2% as you can see on the bottom of the left chart, reflecting lower fixed income valuations. Over the last 12 months, the total return was 8.8%. As discussed previously, our performance-based strategy has a longer-term investment horizon with higher, but more volatile return expectations. This volatility can be seen by the chart on the lower right. It highlights the one, five and 10-year performance-based internal rates of return. The one year trends has been volatile throughout the pandemic with the two most recent quarters, significantly higher than the returns experienced during the middle of 2020. Conversely, the five and 10-year trends are stable and closer to our expected returns. Moving to Slide 9. Allstate Protection Plans continues to grow revenue and profit. As you recall, we purchased Allstate Protection Plans for $1.4 billion in 2017 to broaden the protection solutions offered to customers. It provides low cost protection with excellent service. Products are primarily sold for U.S. retailers and leverage the Allstate brand. Since acquisition, Allstate Protection Plans has experienced rapid top-line growth and improved profitability. Revenues have grown at a compound annual rate of 48% over the last three years, as you can see on the bottom left. And we're more than $1 billion over the latest 12 months. Adjusted net income went from a loss of $22 million in 2017 to income of $148 million over the last 12 months. Additional growth will be achieved by further expanding appliance furniture and mobile phone protection, expanding the geographic footprint outside the U.S. and creating new innovative services such as two-day appliance repair. This acquisition has been an incredible success for us. Now let's move to Slide 10, which highlights Allstate attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate continued to generate attractive returns with adjusted net income return on equity of 23.2% for the last 12 months, which was 5.7 points higher than the prior year. Excellent capital management and strong cash flows have enabled Allstate to return cash to shareholders while simultaneously investing in growth. We provided significant cash returns to shareholders in the first quarter through a combination of $601 million in share repurchases and $164 million in common stock dividends. The current $3 billion share repurchase program is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. Given our growth strategy and sustainable earnings potential, we announced a 50% increase in the quarterly common shareholder dividend to $0.81 paid to shareholders on April 1. The total cash return provided to shareholders was 7.8% of average market capitalization over the last 12 months. With that context, let's open up the line for questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your question, please. Josh Shanker : Yes. Thank you very much for taking my question. So it looks like there's very good success in the allstate.com direct model. Can we talk a little about whether we shuttered the purchasing through Esurance and the sort of flows we're seeing on the new policy apps on the allstate.com site? Tom Wilson : Glenn, do you want to take that? Glenn Shapiro : Sure. Yes. So we have not completely shuttered Esurance. What we've done is we've redirected our marketing dollars from the Esurance brand to the Allstate brand. And in addition to that, we've invested more in the Allstate brand as well. So \u2013 but part of that was being able to move that marketing. So while Esurance has trailed down, we're still taking advantage of the goodwill that we've paid for over years of that brand. And the fact that people recognize it, still find the Esurance out there and they have good products for a portion of our market. So we're still selling some there, but the growth is absolutely being driven by the Allstate brand. As you saw in the supplement that or the Q, we've got 33% increase in direct sold business. So it's really taking off and we've got more capacity going into that system, because a direct system is \u2013 I won't say only limited, but a main limiter would be your capacity, your sales capacity in there. So we're growing the contact center, improving web flows and really growing the Allstate branded direct sold business. [Indiscernible] as you know, is part of transformative growth, we're also building a new technology ecosystem, a product management system and a customer experience system. As that gets rolled out, we will shutdown the Esurance system and then we will stop selling products under the Esurance thing. But we have some time to do that. Josh Shanker : And the 278,000 new policy apps at Allstate direct, are those apples-to-apples with the 200 or so that you sold one year ago, or was that part of a joint direct captive sort of relationship where we're directly the lead generator or are they complete apples-to-apples those two types of new applications? Tom Wilson : Glenn, do you want to take? Glenn Shapiro : Yes. Sure. Yes, it would be an apples-to-apples. It's basically just think about customers that come to us by either clicking or calling directly into an 800 number as opposed to the customers that come to us through an agent. So it would be an apples-to-apples comparison. Josh Shanker : And can we talk about National General, Encompass and Allstate brand through independent agents, is Encompass going to be called National General, even though the National General and Encompass products are kind of a different target customer and what would be wrong with calling the product Allstate? Tom Wilson : Well, let me take the branding question then Glenn can fill in how we're doing the transition, because it's different for Encompass than it is for the Allstate independent agent. So first from a branding standpoint, we've decided that the Allstate brand and personal property liability will be on business that we control both the sales and the service on it. So that's both the Allstate agents and then direct whether that's a web or call center. For the independent agent business, we've rebranded National General. So it's National General and Allstate company and we launch it, I think beginning of January. So that you get the relationship with Allstate, but that everybody understands that it's separate than that, which you would get from an Allstate agent. We do not do that with the Allstate brand in the circle of protection. So for example, we sell under the Allstate name at Walmart, sell under the Allstate name at Home Depot, at target, which gives us both increased exposure to customers, enables us to further leverage that capability. And quite honestly, it's helped us dramatically expand Allstate protection products because of the power of their brand. So slightly different strategy from a branding standpoint, inside the personal property liability markets and outside, but we try to leverage it everywhere we can, but provide, make sure that that brand stands for certain things in different areas. Glenn, do you want to talk about your plans to both integrate Encompass and Allstate independent agents into National General and then Josh\u2019s question on branding at the same time. Glenn Shapiro : Yes. So thanks Josh, because I think it's an interesting question because I think if you take from a legacy standpoint, National General and what it was best that known for in Encompass and what is best that known for, it would be different as we suggested. But as Tom just pointed out National General and Allstate company, that's going to be a different story. We're launching middle market products. So think about basically the Allstate product capability in the middle market auto and home and other personal lines. On the National General platform and branded as National General and Allstate company starting in the second half of this year and then really fast expansion. So it would be to all 50 States within 18 months of the start of that. So before the end of next year. So really National General and Allstate company is going to be a company that is serving from nonstandard up through a mass affluent, and everything in between. It really is another national player in the independent agent space. And we've gotten a phenomenal reaction from independent agents and they are genuinely excited to have another significant player and with the capabilities of Allstate, National General combined in that market. And so we're positioned really well to grow with a lot of greenfield ahead of us in the independent agent space. Josh Shanker : The Encompass name will disappear? Tom Wilson : It will be at part of National General and Allstate company, correct. Whether we grow the policies to a new policy or leave the policy outstanding under the Encompass name and basically put National General stuff on top of it, it would just depend on the cost of it. And Encompass, it goes first and the Allstate independent agent, which is Allstate brand products sold through independent agents in rural spaces where it was not economic to have a captive agent, mostly there's a few places where it didn't work that way, but mostly that will transition over time as well. Josh Shanker : Excellent. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your question, please. Jimmy Bhullar : Hi, good morning. So first I guess for Glenn or Mario, but the question on just auto \u2013the auto business. How do you see the interplay between the frequency and pricing? And it seems like everybody's had very good margins in personal auto over the last several quarters. At what point do you see sort of pricing catch up to that? And in that environment, do you think if the market stays competitive; are you still in a position to grow your discount? Tom Wilson : Let me provide an overview and then Glenn if you want to jump onto this one. So first I'm going to go up a little bit. First, it's about how do we think about increasing market share and we'll use two words together profitable growth. We put them together because that's what we want. We do not believe that growth with no profit is good for shareholders. So the objective of course is maximize shareholder value. Our expected outcomes for our team are that they will balance between growth and profitability. Our strategy of course is as Mario talked about in the first phase, second phase of transforming growth is getting more competitive auto insurance product. And we supported that, of course in worse being successful by reducing our costs. So the first thing would be we can control our costs and we can make sure that if we reduce prices to get more competitive, we still maintain our margins. Obviously, we want to be smarter whether that be how we price or how we acquire business and our marketing and we're also using telematics. And then as we go forward with transformative growth, it'll be by being faster with better technology and having new products affordable, simple and connected that are sold through that broad range of distribution that Glenn was just talking about from direct to Allstate agents. So Glenn, do you want to jump in on the specifics? Glenn Shapiro : Yes. So first I'll talk about frequency a little bit and then go to competitive position. So from frequency standpoint, what we're \u2013 everybody has benefited from some lower frequency. But we've also looked at a deeper level at it, but then just sort of miles driven and the number of accidents coming out, because there are differences by books and you see differences in competitors as to how much tailwind that's providing. So, we look at the fact that commuter driven or take it from rush hour losses are down about three points more than overall losses. And we look at rural driving is down about four or five points less than urban driving. And so we look at these that are pretty deep level, and we we're fortunate to work with Arity and have a lot of data on this with 10 years plus of telematics that we get pretty granular into how we're looking at it and understanding the frequency picture. So we've got a tailwind with that, which takes me into competitive position because we've been moving our competitive position pretty aggressively. Like you see a minus 1.5 on average premium, and that might feel or seem slight, but there's a lot underneath that. We've moved new business pricing. We've moved telematic pricing. We've reduced the cost of our Milewise program. That's grown really nicely and all of that is inside of there. So our competitive position on the price changes we've made and that are still going into market have really improved. And our close rates are up. We're starting to see those really positive signs of momentum across multiple states.  And then you put on top of that, the fact that some of our competitors have already taken price increases, some of those out there. We've heard others say that they're going to start taking bites at the apple in terms of price increases. And you look at our position and obviously we're in a position right now. We continue to invest in growth. We can still put money into marketing. We could still put money into competitive price position because of where we're positioned, which really puts us in a great spot to grow going forward. Jimmy Bhullar : And then just any comments on your views on if growth to the extent you're able to quantify or give a range on how I'm assuming it should trend higher later this year and into next year as you're implementing some of these initiatives in direct and independent agency, but to whatever extent you can quantify or give us an idea do you expect it to be? Tom Wilson : Well, we're not \u2013 we don't give forecast on if growth or frequency or case tasks, these things you can't predict. Let me talk about growth a little bit, because it is really an important question that many analysts have. And of course it drives huge value in the market today. And so we were starting to have first actuals matter and we had a great quarter. I mean, over 25% revenue growth, our fifth growth was in the low teens. And we're headed towards increasing our market share pretty significantly in personal lines this year, which is consistent with our strategy. I guess what we set out to do? Now, you'd have some naysayers and say, well, you bought it with the acquisition of National General. And that's of course true. But you always have to investigate market share. In this case, it is real growth. And we look at it and said, if we had taken the net price that we paid for National General and thrown it into marketing or higher commissions or some kind of spiff. It likely would have given us less growth than we got. And certainly not the kind of profitability we're getting from it. The same thing, but we did buy it. But we did the same thing with Allstate protection plans, right? We bought SquareTrade. We repositioned it with our brands and that acquired growth and turned into an organic growth platform. We expect the same thing to happen with National General. The difference is we paid a slightly higher premium for SquareTrade than we did for National General. As it relates to the Allstate brand, we have multiple ways to grow, right. We got the Allstate agents and we're making \u2013 helping them transition to a new model. We have the direct business, which we've launched in is so by the way, at a different price than through an agent, because we believe customers should pay for what they get. And if you get an agent and get that help, you should be willing to pay for that. And so overall we feel like the Allstate brand is positioned for long-term growth as well. And so we feel like we've got an overall plan to move forward, has got transformative growth in it. It's got real growth this quarter and it's got \u2013 we're building platforms and we'll continue that growth going forward. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please. Greg Peters : Good morning. My first question will be on reinsurance. Tom, I was hoping you could just give us an overview of how reinsurance helps the company this quarter. And then I know you did file your reinsurance update piece and maybe talk about what's changing going forward. I did note that the costs in the first quarter about 14% higher versus a year ago is that the type of cost or increase we should expect for the full year. Tom Wilson : Greg, let me start with this strategic perspective on it, and then either Maria or Glenn, if you want to talk about the first quarter. So I'm going to go back a long way. But in 2004 and 2005 we had huge catastrophe losses. We weren't earning any money on the homeowner's business. We'd make some money one year and we would lose money the next year. When you looked at over time, I think this is not a really good business. So we looked at getting out and we said what \u2013 if we were out, we'd want to be in, because it does, our customers do want it. So maybe it's just this catastrophe risk they don't want. So we created a very comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance program to basically divest certain portions of the risk we took on. And that's evolved over time. We have a very sophisticated multi-year program. It's got \u2013 it's by stated got different by event. It's got the aggregate in it. And we bear that cost each and every quarter, obviously that comes through. And then sometimes it pays off. And what you saw this quarter was the aggregate kicked in. And so from losses, some of the losses, which were last year showed up as reducing our catastrophe losses this quarter, which were upgraded significantly. And that helps smooth it out. And we've looked at that from what kind of return on capital do we give up to the reinsurers and we're quite comfortable giving up the return that they get to avoid the volatility that comes from it. And so it's helped us reposition the homeowners business, so that now it's a very consistent source of profitability for us. As I was saying to the prior question, we don't believe in growth with like running homeowners above a 100 is not a good plan and you're destroying value at that point with growth. And we don't believe in that. So we've used reinsurance to help reposition the business. We did a whole bunch of other stuff including changing the product and changing the way we price and how we underwrite it, where \u2013 how we do our segmentation by down to specific risks codes. So how we pay for roofs, there's a whole bunch of stuff we've changed underneath that over the last decade. But it's a really good business. In reinsurance, using that reinsurers helped us get there. So what you saw this quarter was a benefit, which is more than was earned in this quarter, but it was paid for in the prior quarter. So if you \u2013 some people want to exclude it from this year's quarter, totally get that. Unlike that's fine. But then you should not be counting all the costs from the other time. Mario, Glenn, do you want to talk about the cost of reinsurance and the program going forward? Mario Rizzo : Sure. I can jump in on that Tom. And just to give you a little color, Greg, on the benefits in the quarter. We recovered about $955 million in the quarter on a net basis. Part of that was from our per occurrence nationwide program where we retain the first $500 million of an event. And then we have coverage up \u2013 in our current program up to $5 billion. And then as Tom mentioned, we also have an aggregate cover, which is about $1 billion, which spans a 12-month period. We also had recoveries under that. So combined, it was about $955 million. That's net of reinstatement premiums in the quarter, and it was principally on the freeze event in Texas. So the freeze event on a net basis cost us $586 million in the quarter. Once you start peeling back the prior year component of that reinsurance recovery, which was about $150 million. You get to a gross loss in Texas north of $1.3 billion. So we've benefited pretty significantly in the quarter from our reinsurance program. As you mentioned, we posted on our website \u2013 we placed most of the nationwide program this quarter and we still have a component of the nationwide program to do. And then remember we have a separate Florida program. The costs year-over-year, because we've included National General in this year's program. It\u2019s going to be slightly higher than it was a year ago when you add up what we were spending on reinsurance and what National General was spending on reinsurance. But in terms of what you saw in the first quarter, you got to remember, that's still last year's program that was placed May 1. And what we saw last year was the increase we experienced was mainly in the Florida program. And you're seeing that kind of cycle through in the first quarter. We will start incurring the cost of this year's program when it incepts which is on June 1. Greg Peters : That was a thorough answer. I appreciate it. I'd like to pivot to the expense ratio on Page 6 of the presentation slide deck you are continuing every quarter to show improvement in almost every quarter and show improvement in your expense ratio. And I guess when we think about the sustainability or more importantly, is this a trend that we should continue to expect forever? Obviously, I don't think your expense ratio is going to zero, but the improvement is noteworthy. And then just as in the slide, I did notice that the expense ratio was up in the Allstate protection home business. So, I'm curious if there was something unusual on that? Tom Wilson : So, overall, Greg you are right our strategy to get a more competitive in auto insurance pricing, which was Phase 2 [indiscernible] transformed to growth, included taking down costs. And as you know, we did a large reduction in force last year, did about 3,800 people starting to see that come through this year. At the same time, our advertising was way up. And so, we try to balance between those two. I don't think you could expect it to come down half a point every quarter from now till an infinite item. You should know that our strategy is to both keep reducing cost every place we can so that we can have a more affordable product for our customers and therefore a better price. So, we get more of them. But not invest in growth, because if the kind of a return on capital we're getting in these businesses, we should definitely be seeking more growth. Mario, do you want to talk more about what you \u2013 this current quarter and what the ins and outs were? Mario Rizzo : Yes. Thanks Craig. So, I guess, it's not mentioned. We're going to continue to focus on reducing our cost structure. And like we said, really all along, our focus on reducing our cost structure is not a margin expansion focus, it's a growth focus. And it's a growth focus because reducing our costs enables us to invest more in growth. And you saw it this quarter where we invested more in marketing and the component of our underwriting expense ratio related to marketing actually increased by nine tenths of a point. Yet it was more than offset by the operating cost reductions that Tom referenced from last year. So, real ins and outs were more investment in advertising, more than offset by cost reductions and net-net a half a point improvement in kind of the underlying expense ratio in the quarter. And we're going to continue to focus on moving that number down. The other thing I'd mentioned on expenses, and it's not obvious in our numbers is, part of our focus on cost reduction has been on getting more efficient in claim handling. And we've improved the efficiency in our loss adjustment expense, which comes through the loss ratio. But again, we consider it as a core part of our cost reduction efforts to improve the combine \u2013 improve the cost structure, creates a path we need to invest and be able to grow more and continue to deliver excellent return. So, I think what you saw in the quarter was really kind of proof of, of how that strategy is playing out. In terms of the homeowner expense ratio specifically, Greg, I'd have to go back and take a look at what components of it \u2013 whether it came through distribution costs, or underwriting costs, whether it was like inspections, and so on. So let me take that one offline and I'll get back to you on that one. Greg Peters : Got it. Thank you for the answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from a lot of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Your question, please. Paul Newsome : Good morning. Thanks for the call. Congratulations on the quarter. I was hoping you could expand a little bit more about what it means to transition the existing through agents to a different model. We get emails from agents all the time. Usually, they are worried about this or that. Is this a transition that's really towards more of an independent agent type structure with equations, or are we talking to something that's completely out of book? Or if it's sort of to be determined? Tom Wilson : Let me provide a little view and then Glenn can tell you some of the specifics of what we're doing. But Paul first thing I would say is now we're not going to do the nationwide deal and turn them all into independent agents. We don't think that makes sense from a customer standpoint. Customers come to us because they love the Allstate brand. We have a really strong brand, long relationships, so we're not planning on turning them into something else. And obviously the fast pace of change has all of this on it, whether you're a retailer or anybody what's going on in the world. And the good news for our agents is that still a majority of consumers want an insurance professional help them buy insurance. And our agents are really good at it. That said, people are more comfortable with self-service, simple items and the technology enables a computer to do some of the work that used to be handled in by people and stellar in some cases handle the local offices. So we have to transition their model and go where the customer is going. And so that includes maybe we don't have to use as much real estate as we use today. We certainly do not need to do as much service work in agent offices. So, we have a little over 10,000 Allstate agents. There's probably 26,000 to 27,000 people working in those agencies. Some of those people are doing service work. And we think we can do that either centrally at a lower cost and be more effective for our customers, or just get the computer to do it. Nobody does it at all. So, we have to figure out how do we transition those people in those offices to doing service work, to doing sales work. Or if they can't transition those licensed sales professionals, have the agents build up staff, they can move into that. So last year, one of the things that Glenn and team did was they raised new business commissions to incent, to give people the opportunity to invest more, and sell more things to more people and get more people selling for them. To offset that and continue to make sure we're meeting our customers\u2019 cost needs, we slightly reduced renewal commissions to reflect that. So, if you're an agent and you're focused on new sales, that's a good thing. You're excited about it, you are off and ready to go. If you've been focused more on service and not on growth, then you are not going to be as excited about that change because it changes your business model. So, we have to help them transition from where they are to the place where the customers want us to go, which is they want help, but they want to do it in technologically efficient, low-cost way. And we think that there's a good way to do it. Glenn can give you some examples of what we're doing with our existing agents. We've already talked about what we're doing direct to serve our customers. And then we're also trying some new models that Glenn can talk about, that do the same thing, which is use people to help people buy insurance in a local space, but at a lower cost. Glenn, do you want to give them some more specifics on that? Glenn Shapiro : Yes, absolutely. And Paul, Tom hit a lot of the really important points here. But a couple bear repeating, so no harm being repetitive, but it's really important. So, it's a hard no on the IAP. So, I'll just reiterate, as Tom said, we are dedicated to our exclusive agent model completely. And we believe that there is a not only a meaningful place, but a huge place for our exclusive agents to grow in the market because as Tom said, most consumers still want to work with an agent. So, in the presentation materials that talked about higher growth, lower cost models, so, I'll just hit a couple of things. Lower cost, we've been really reticent in the past to allow agents to consolidate locations or to even go in some cases without real estate or reduce their real estate footprint. We've been very focused on a model that is how many signs do you have up across the countryside. And we're going to really lean in to allowing agents to reduce costs in the way they run their business. And Tom talked a bit about the service. We started that in 2019 and we built it up a bit and everything, but we really have to get to a centralized, and more efficient and effective way of serving customers than separately across 10,000 different locations. And we can take a lot of cost out of the system and reduce the cost for the agents so that they can focus on growth. From a higher growth standpoint, it's about leaning in, on the marketing that they do, that we can help them do more effectively and efficiently as a large enterprise, the lead management that they do, compensating them more for new business, as Tom mentioned also. That's the existing agents and how we want to transition that to higher growth, lower costs. The new models, for example, and we have several hundred of these already in place actually where we are learning from our Canadian operation. Actually, in Canada we have Allstate agents who operate sort of independently from one another. It's not an agent with multiple staff, they are independent workers and producers. And they work on sort of a balance between being in communities, and driving leads themselves and getting leads from the company. And it's been very successful. We're growing very fast in Canada. So, we're leveraging that model and looking at models with no real estate in local markets that are part of the community and are able to take leads and also generate their own leads in that community and grow. So, it's early in the process, but in the second half of the year, we're looking to ramp those up significantly. Paul Newsome : I guess, relatedly, could you talk a little bit about any early looks on the pilot programs for new agent recruitment? And if there's some different things that will be happening there in the near future? Tom Wilson : Glenn, do I take that? Hey Glenn, do you want to take that or maybe you are on mute. Glenn Shapiro : My apologies, I did go on mute there. Yes, so we're focused on those new models. I just mentioned in terms of our recruitment right now. And so we have been, I think, \u2013 we have several hundred already and we have a lot more in the pipeline. So, we're looking to grow with those new models. What we're really focused on with the existing agent group, well we\u2019re recruiting sung into the compensation programs that we have as opposed to what we called enhanced compensation program, which was a higher cost model before we're recruiting some into that as more of what you had refer to as a traditional exclusive agent. But the heavier emphasis on our recruiting is on those new models, where with our existing agents, we are really focused on investing to get more of those agents growing and wanting to grow. The good news is they are growing right now. We have increased new business production with our existing established agents. So, when you see the total that somebody referenced earlier, it's slightly down on the overall agency force that is driven by sort of a lack of new appointments, the existing agents, new businesses up year-over-year Tom Wilson : And Glenn, let me just add last point which is when you see that little red bar on our graph, that was an intentional choice on our part, not a flaw in the system. So, it's not like we decided that, you know what, we were hiring these new agents, we required them to have their own office, we require that they have support staff. To make that work when you have no customers, we're paying 30% upfront commissions which then stayed high for it, not at 30%, but stayed higher than customers should have to pay for them for about five years. And we said what, but this is not the model of the future. We could have kept that going while we develop these new models. And the system would look like it would have been generating more growth than it is today. But we say, economically, that's just not the smart thing to do. Like we're not using shareholders money, right. And that's where we get into which the conversation we\u2019re talking about before is profitable growth. If you're going to [indiscernible] profitable long-term growth, and so you have some bumps, but that's not about a flaw in the system. That's about an intentional choice. Paul Newsome : Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore. Your question, please. David Motemaden : Hi, good morning. I guess I wanted to just touch on retention. I was surprised it fell a little bit here again also, especially, given some of the rate actions that you guys have taken. I guess, could you maybe just talk about how much of an impact the lapsing of any billing leniency may have had on the retention, and what your expectations are for retention going forward, like, should we see a snapback here in the second quarter? Yes, I guess that's just my question on retention. Tom Wilson : David let me provide an overview and Glenn, you can take the impact of the pandemic billing stuff. First, I would say retention is really hard to do attribution on. People leave for all different reasons. And sometimes it's for price, sometimes it's because they move, sometimes it's they bought a new car. And so, it's difficult to get it down to precision to, in a point. What you do know is if your net promoter score is good and you are doing a better job for customers, they should stay around longer. And if you are competitive in price and you are changing your price not only for new business, which we've done, but also for your existing customers, which we've done, so they have a better price and that should also keep them. But there's lots of different variations. So it's kind of really hard to predict it. Glenn, do you want to talk about how you're feeling about retention this quarter? And again, we have a hard time, nobody really knows how to predict retention. Glenn Shapiro : Yes, absolutely. So, retention is a lagging metric, first of all I\u2019ll start there. Wherever or whenever a customer decides to cancel, move, shift we record it and report it at the point of what would have been the renewal. So, there's a bit of a lag to that. So, while we stopped the special payment plans during last year, there's still some of that trick going in. So as Tom said, attribution is difficult on this. But there's a portion of it that's related to that. No question. Secondly though it is a highly competitive market right now, shopping is up, advertising is up and there is some impact from that. It's interesting. When you look at National General, as an example, if you saw in some of our disclosures, like National General\u2019s, new business, it's really eye-popping, because National General writes a lot more new business to grow because they have a shorter cycle time. As our business shifts and we look at overall protection business and we're writing in more markets, and we're writing direct and not just through our exclusive agents, that number will move around a little bit on retention, but our focus is to create a lot of new business. We're going to do that. That's what transformative growth is about. We're going to create a lot of new business so that the undulations of retention don't mute our overall growth. David Motemaden : Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe just on the new business side, obviously great growth, especially on the direct side in new apps. I guess I'm wondering maybe if you could just \u2013 you had kind of mentioned it in your script, but want to just a bit more details on the Milewise offering and how that did this quarter? How big that is as a percentage of the entire book? And was that really the driver behind the direct growth that we saw in the quarter? Mario Rizzo : Glenn, you can take where we are with Milewise, and number of states and how [indiscernible] you got the done pricing. I would say though, when you just step all the way back, we're about building a digital insurer. And sometimes that gets lost into how big and how successful we are given the size and scale of our company. [Indiscernible] sometimes people look at people who only do that and assume that, they are about to take over the market. We're happy to compete. We feel like we're really doing well in here. We\u2019re early in telematics. We think we're a leader in telematics. And this is an example of a product where we were out early, we're aggressively advertising it and it's resonating. Glenn, do you want to talk about, what you've done to help it grow? Glenn Shapiro : Yes, absolutely. And to the question of, is it driving the direct growth, I would say, no. Direct growth a majority of that is not Milewise. It's an interesting thing to look at, as Tom said, when you look at it inside a company like Allstate, Milewise will look relatively small. It's up, this year it's something close to in autos. Policies, I think, are foreign change times, autos are six in change times what they were a year prior. So significant growth. If this was a standalone startup sitting outside of a large insurance company like Allstate, it is the largest in the industry pay by mile program. And it would look really big, and really fast growing and really attractive. Inside of Allstate, it is helping our growth, but it is not driving our growth, is the way I'd say that. We're looking to expand over time on Milewise. Right now, it's available to about 50% of consumers across the country. And we have more states lined up for that. It does require the OBD port, which, I think, everybody knows there are chip shortages out there. We have not run into a problem where we have to slow down our \u2013 Milewise at this point. But we are actively managing our supply chain on it because it is a popular product. And we're managing our state expansion and looking at that so that we don't run into a supply chain issues. Tom Wilson : Thank you for the questions, I think, we're out of time here, it\u2019s top of the hour, and we try to be respectful of your time. Obviously, we appreciate you coming to spend time with us in here about us. We had an excellent quarter the work and you saw from that first slide, the amount of expertise and effort that went into delivering all that for the quarter. It wasn't just this quarter, it's what we do over time, but we feel good about where we're at. So, we've had great operating results as well. So, thank you for your participation. And we'll see you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

After the speaker's presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Mark Nogal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Nogal : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted related materials on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements. So please refer to our 10-K for 2020 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let's start on Slide 2. Today, we're going to link operating results to strategy in order to show how we expect to continue to generate shareholder value. So Allstate\u2019s strategy has two components; increased personal property-liability market share and expand protection solutions, which are shown in the two ovals on the left. The transformative growth plan to increase market share and personal property-liability has four components. This strategy would drive market valuation by executing, innovating, and focusing on long-term value creation. So in the first half of the year, we executed well for customers, we executed well financially and for shareholders as you can see on the right hand panel. Property-liability market share increased by approximately one percentage point through the acquisition of National General. Allstate Protection Plans continued to grow rapidly by broadening the product offering to include appliances and furniture and expanding availability through Home Depot stores. Strong execution generated excellent financial results with revenues increasing 23.8% compared to the prior year, adjusted net income of $3 billion, and a return on equity of 23.8% for the last 12 months. Shareholders benefited from a 50% increase in the quarterly common dividend and a reduction in outstanding shares by 2.4% just this year, under the current $3 billion share repurchase program. Yesterday, the Board approved a new $5 billion common share repurchase program, which represents approximately 13% of current market capitalization, and we expect to complete that by the end of March of 2023. Let's continue on Slide 3. In addition to operating execution, we're innovating to create long-term value. The transformative growth plan to create a digital insurance company is making good progress. Today, we're going to spend time talking about the distribution component of that plan. Allstate is amongst the leaders in telematics capabilities with Drivewise in the industry's largest pay-per-mile product Milewise, which offers customers unique value. Arity, our telematics service platform company recently launched Arity IQ, which when combined with LeadCloud and Transparent.ly platforms will integrate telematics information into pricing at the time of quote, rather than at the time after the sale. We enhanced our competitive position in independent agent channel by using National General to consolidate and improve our IA business model. We executed agreements to sell Allstate Life Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company New York, to redeploy capital out of lower growth and return businesses and reduce exposure to interest rates. Increasing market share, while maintaining attractive returns and expanding protection solutions through transformation, targeted acquisitions, and divestitures will create shareholder value. Slide 4 lays out the Allstate's strong second quarter performance. Revenues of 12.6 billion in the quarter increased 21.6% compared to the prior year, largely reflects the National General acquisition and higher net investment income. Property-liability premiums earned and policies in force increased by 12.9% and 12.1% respectively. Net investment income of $974 million increased by over $0.75 billion compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting $649 million of income from the performance-based portfolio. Net income of 1.6 billion was reported in the second quarter compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. Adjusted net income was $1.1 billion or $3.79 per diluted share as you can see from the table on the bottom, that's a 40% increase from the prior year quarter. Allstate's excellent execution and strong operating results in the quarter contributed to that return on equity, which I just mentioned of 23.8% over the last 12 months. Let's move to Slide 5 to discuss our progress on building transformative growth business models. So, transformative growth is a multiyear initiative and what we're working to do is build a low cost digital insurer with broad distribution, and that's going to be accomplished through four areas; expanding customer access, improving customer value, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition, and deploying new technology ecosystems. And in transformative growth - you wouldn't do it all in one day of course, it's got five phases, and substantial progress has been made in phases two and three. Phase two successes include improving the competitive price position of auto insurance, protecting margins by reducing costs, new advertising was launched with increased investment. We also are off to an excellent start with National General. And of course the phases overlap, so progress has also been made in Phase three. So we're transforming the distribution platform, including supporting transition of Allstate agents to higher growth and lower cost models, which we'll discuss on the next slide. Improving customer acquisition sophistication will lower costs relative to lifetime value. We continue to focus on lowering underwriting and claims expenses to deliver lower cost protection to customers, and we\u2019ve designed the new technology architecture. We've coded much of the new applications. The next step for us is to launch an integrated system with one product in one state. Turning to Slide 6, let's review how we're transforming the Allstate agent, Allstate direct sales, and independent agent distribution platforms to grow market share. The illustrative on the right side of the slide provides a view into our growth expectations by channel over time. Starting with Allstate exclusive agents, we're making progress transitioning to a higher growth and lower cost model. This year, we changed agent compensation by increasing their business compensation opportunity and reducing a bonus paid on policy renewals. We expect to continue this shift from renewal compensation to new sale because it aligns with what consumers want. Consumers want assistance with purchasing insurance more than they want routine policy service. To lower cost for agents, we're digitizing processes, redesigning products to increase self-service, and expanding centralized service support. We're also working to reduce agent operating expenses and real estate costs. These changes will improve the customer value proposition with lower cost and easier service. Now, of course, you're not going to do this in one day either, so a multiyear transformation - transition program is in place to support existing agents, we've initiated it and it has different levels of support based on agent performance. Given this transition, we reduced new agent appointments last year, which has had a negative impact on new business levels. But as Mario will discuss next, this has been offset by higher productivity from existing agents. At the same time, we have two new agent models in market, which have a personal touch, but a lower cost structure. All of these changes are supported by more competitive auto insurance pricing and increased marketing spending, which is designed to continue to grow. But as you can see on the right, the net impact of these changes for the Allstate agent channel is to be flat to a slight decline in sales in the short-term, but increased growth thereafter. The Allstate direct sales effort leverages the capabilities that we built for the insurance brand, and we've shifted our advertising focus away from insurance to be totally focused on the Allstate brand and utilizing the direct channel for Allstate brand sales as well. The pricing is lower than the Allstate agent model since it doesn't come with the help of an agent. And as this business grows, we're improving our operational and marketing effectiveness. Direct sales now represent 29% of new auto business sales. And we expect that to continue to grow rapidly as you can see on the right. Independent agent distribution also represents an attractive growth opportunity. The acquisition National General enhanced our capabilities in this channel and they added 4 million policies in force. Additional growth is expected by broadening the product portfolio from high risk drivers to middle market auto and home insurance through the existing agent relationships. We also expect to increase the number of agents actively engaged in selling National General products. So when you combine this effective and efficient distribution, with more competitive auto insurance pricing, enhanced marketing, advanced pricing and telematics and the digital experience, that's the transformative growth plan that'll drive property-liability market share growth. So Mario will now discuss the second quarter results in more detail. Mario Rizzo : Thanks Tom. Turning to Slide 7, let's dive deeper into near-term results on our multifaceted approach to grow property-liability market share. As you can see in the chart on the left side of the slide, property-liability policies in force grew by 12.1% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by National General and growth in Allstate brand new business. National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of 4 million policies, and Allstate brand property-liability policies increased in the quarter driven by growth in homeowners and other personal lines. Allstate brand auto policies in force declined slightly compared to the prior year quarter, but increased sequentially for the second consecutive quarter, including growth of 111,000 policies compared to prior year and as you can see by the table on the lower left. The chart on the right shows a breakdown of personal auto new issued applications compared to prior year. We continue to make progress in building higher growth business models, as we look to achieve leading positions in all three primary distribution channels. The middle section of the chart on the right shows Allstate brand impacts by channel, which in total generated a 6.7% increase in new business growth compared to the prior year. Modest increases from existing agents excluding new appointments, and a 31% increase in the direct channel more than offset the volume that would normally have been generated by newly appointed agents as we pilot new agent models with higher growth and lower costs. The addition of National General also added 481,000 new auto applications in the quarter. Let's turn to Slide 8 to review property-liability margin results in the second quarter. The recorded combined ratio of 95.7 increased 5.9 points compared to the prior year quarter. This was primarily driven by increased losses relative to the historically low auto accident frequency experienced in the prior year quarter due to the pandemic. Increased losses were partially offset by lower pandemic related expenses, primarily shelter in place paybacks in 2020, as well as lower catastrophe losses. These are represented by the green bars in the combined ratio reconciliation chart on the lower left of the slide. Shifting to the chart on the bottom right, we continue to make progress in reducing our cost structure. This enables improvement in the competitive price position of auto insurance, and investments in marketing and technology while maintaining strong returns. The total property-liability expense ratio of 24.7 in the second quarter decreased by 7.1 points compared to the prior year, again, driven by lower Coronavirus related expenses. This was partially offset by the amortization of purchased intangibles associated with the acquisition of National General, restructuring charges, and a 0.7 point increase from higher investment in advertising. Excluding these items as shown by the dark blue bars, the expense ratio decreased by 0.4 points in the second quarter, compared to the prior year period, decreased 1.7 points below year end 2019 and 2.5 points below year end 2018 reflecting continued progress and improving cost efficiencies. Claims expenses have also been reduced through innovations such as QuickFoto Claim, Virtual Assist and aerial imagery, which also improves the customer experience. These claim improvements are not reflected in the expense ratio, but are in the loss ratio and also helped maintain margins. Moving to Slide 9, let's discuss how our auto insurance profitability which remains very strong, and is still favorable to pre-pandemic levels, despite pandemic driven volatility. Allstate protection auto underlying combined ratio finished at 91.8. As you can see from the chart, the level remains favorable to 2017 through 2019 historical second quarter and year end levels despite increasing by 9.4 points compared to the prior year quarter. The increase to the prior year quarter reflects a comparison to a period with historically low auto accident frequencies. The improvement relative to historical levels is driven by auto accident frequency remaining below pre-pandemic levels, partly offset by auto severity increases and competitive pricing enhancements. To illustrate the pandemic driven volatility, Allstate brand auto property damage gross frequency increased 47.3% from the prior year quarter, but is 21% lower than the same period in 2019. Auto severity increases persisted relative to the prior year quarter and pre-pandemic periods across coverages largely driven by the shift in mix to more severe higher speed auto accidents and rising inflationary impacts in both used car values and replacement part costs. The incurred severity increases are running higher than general inflation, which are reflected in the reported combined ratio. To counteract rising severity we are leveraging advanced claim capabilities, predictive modeling, advanced photo and video utilization and deep expertise in repair process management to enable a scaled response to inflation and supply constraints. Targeted price increases will also be implemented as necessary to maintain attractive auto insurance returns. Now let's shift to Slide 10, which highlights investment performance for the second quarter. Net investment income totaled $974 million in the quarter, which was $754 million above the prior year quarter driven by higher performance based income as shown in the chart on the left Performance-based income totaled $649 million in the second quarter, as shown in grey, reflecting both idiosyncratic and broad based valuation increases in private equity investments, and to a lesser extent gains from the sale of real estate equity. Market-based income shown in blue was $3 million above the prior year quarter. The impact of reinvestment rates below the average interest bearing portfolio yield was mitigated in the quarter by higher average assets under management and prepayment fee income. Our total portfolio return in the second quarter totaled 2.6% reflecting income as well as higher fixed income and equity valuations. We take an active approach to optimizing our returns per unit of risk over appropriate investment horizons. Our investment activities are integrated into our overall enterprise risk and return process and play an important role in generating shareholder value. We draw upon a deep and experienced team of roughly 350 professionals to leverage expertise and asset allocation, portfolio construction, fundamental research, field leadership, quantitative methods, manager selection and risk management. While the results for this quarter were exceptionally strong, particularly for the performance-based investments, we manage the portfolio with a longer term view on returns. At the right we have provided our annualized portfolio returns over a three, five and 10 year horizon. As disclosed in our investors supplement our performance based portfolio has delivered an attractive 12% IRR over the last 10 years, which compares favorably to relevant public and private market comparisons. Our performance-based strategy takes a longer term view, where we seek to deliver attractive, absolute and risk adjusted returns and supplement market risk with idiosyncratic risk. Moving to Slide 11, protection services continues to grow revenue and profit. Revenues excluding the impact of realized0 gains and losses increased 27.1% to $581 million in the second quarter. The increase was driven by continued rapid growth in Allstate protection plans, and expanding marketing services at Arity due to the integration of LeadCloud and Transparent.ly, which were acquired as part of the National General acquisition. Policies in force increased 15.5% to 147 million, also driven by Allstate protection plans, and supported by the successful launch with the Home Depot in the first quarter. Adjusted net income was $56 million in the second quarter, representing an increase of $18 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by profitable growth at Allstate protection plans and profits at Arity and Allstate identity protection. Allstate protection plans generated adjusted net income of $42 million in the second quarter and $155 million over the past 12 months. Now, let's move to Slide 12, which highlights Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position. Allstate continued to generate attractive returns in the second quarter, with adjusted net income return on equity of 23.8% for the last 12 months, which was 5.8 points higher than the prior year. Excellent capital management and strong financial results have enabled Allstate to return cash to shareholders while simultaneously investing in growth. We continue to provide significant cash returns to shareholders in the second quarter through a combination of $562 million in share repurchases and $245 million in common stock dividends. We announced the acquisition of SafeAuto in June, leveraging National General's success in integrating companies to accelerate growth. The current $3 billion share repurchase program is expected to be completed in the third quarter. And yesterday the Board approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization to be completed by March 31, 2023. This represents approximately 13% of our current market capitalization. This new authorization continues Allstate's strong track record of providing cash returns to shareholders and reflects in part, the deployable capital generated by the sale of our life and annuity businesses. Moving to Slide 13, it should be clear that Allstate is an attractive investment opportunity. When you invest in Allstate you get ownership of a company with advanced capabilities and a clear strategy, delivering superior financial results relative to peers and the broader market. The table below shows Allstate across key financial metrics over the past five years compared to the S&P 500 and property casualty insurance peers with a market cap of $4 billion or more. As you can see by the four measures on the top operating EPS, operating return on average equity, cash yield and total shareholder return, Allstate is consistently ranked in the top two or three amongst its peers. In the case of operating EPS and cash yield to common shareholders, Allstate is in the top 10% and top 15% respectively, compared to the S&P 500. Moving down one row, Allstate's top line revenue growth relative to peers and the S&P 500 is in the middle of the pack. We are committed to accelerating top line performance through transformative growth and innovating protection while continuing to deliver excellent financial results. Moving down to the price to earnings ratio, Allstate is well below average, eight out of 10 P&C peers and in the 10th percentile amongst the S&P 500. This is an attractive valuation, given our market leading capabilities, excellent returns, future growth prospects and commitment to accelerate growth. Now, let me turn it back over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Let's turn to Slide 14. Let's finish where we started with a more macro and longer term view of Allstate's execution, innovation and long-term value creation as this is a whole report card as his is what you get by investing in Allstate. Empowering customers with protection is a core part of our purpose. We provide a broad set of protection solutions with over 180 million protection policies in force. You see our name while you're watching TV, you're in Walmart, you're in Target, You're in Casco, you're in Home Depot, Allstate is ubiquitous out there protecting customers. We constantly achieve industry leading margins on auto and home insurance, and have attractive risk adjusted investment returns. As a result, the adjusted net income return on equities averaged 15.6% from 2016 to 2020, ranking number two in our peer group. This has led to a 14.9% annualized total shareholder return over the last five years. We have a history of innovation. Transformative growth is a multiyear personal property-liability strategy to build a digital platform that offers low cost affordable, simple and connected protection solutions. We're simultaneously innovating protection by expanding through telematics, product warranties and identity protection. In telematics we've taken a broad and aggressive approach, the insurance offerings and the creation of Arity leading telematics business. Allstate is also innovating new corporate citizenship, focusing on climate change, privacy and equity. For example, we used an underwriting syndicate for $1.2 billion bond offering last year that was exclusively minority women and veteran owned banking enterprises. Long-term value is also being created through proactive capital management, and strong governance. Over the past five and 10 years we've repurchased 25% and 50% respectively of outstanding shares. Among the S&P 500, Allstate is in the top 15% of cash provided to shareholders. At the same time, we've successfully invested over $6 billion in acquisitions, including Allstate protection plans, Allstate identity protection and National General. And of course, strong governance is key to delivering those results. Allstate has an experienced and first management team and Board with relevant expertise. This is acknowledged by the leading proxy advisory firm that has awarded Allstate the top score for governance. Execution, innovation and long-term value creation will continue to drive increased shareholder value. With that context, let's open the line for your questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James, your question please. Greg Peters : Good morning. So I'd like to go back to Slide 5 Tom, and where you lay out the transformative growth strategy, and in the phase two area, you report on substantial progress being made in terms of improved competitive price position in auto insurance. When I went to your supplement, I observed that the average gross premium in the auto brand continued to be lower relative to prior quarters. And I'm just curious how you think about pricing today given the increase in frequency and certainly the increase in severity in the context of your strategy to have an improved competitive price position. Tom Wilson : Okay, let me start and then I'll get Glenn to jump in. First, in terms of transformative growth, we made a conscious strategic decision to improve the competitive position of auto insurance. When we looked at our cost structure and we looked at where other people were, we decided we needed to be more competitive on pricing. And so, we've been working on that. We've reduced our costs. We've reduced price. We know we're more competitive in the market. And actually you can't really look at the average prices Greg because everybody starts in a different place. So, if you're at 100 and I'm at 95 and you go down 2%, it doesn't make you - really it makes you more competitive [ph], but not competitive, so we look at close rates and we know - we looked at the - when people come to us, they quote what percentage do we close, and when the close rate goes up, you assume you're price competitive and you have a better value proposition. And in fact, that's been true this year, and it's one of the reasons why our new business is up. Now we do that, of course, with great surgical precision. So let me maybe provide an overview of auto insurance profitability because it was the focus of so many of the reports issued last night, and Glenn can jump into what he's got going forward. And I'll start with the analytical structure that I use to evaluate our performance in ways that hopefully will be helpful from an investment perspective. The headline would be to evaluate starting with the current absolute number, don't use one analytical method to assess the future and build on your margin for error. So, the current combined ratio for auto insurance this quarter generated an attractive return on capital. When you look at the number, it's a good return on capital. Looking forward of course is what I need to do and investors need to do, and the forecasting challenge is that the volatility of the components is so high that it's hard to do a quarterly forecast that\u2019s accurate enough to make an important decision. So for example, let's say the percentage is up and down, they're really hard to evaluate, the outcome of 50% decrease, and a 30% increase is a 65%. A 45%, decrease and a 35% increase, it sounds pretty similar, right, but it's the 74%. That small 5 point difference on each side creates a 9 point difference on margins. They're typically less than that. So given the volatility of the percentage changes, we build in margins for error. So as it relates to our projections and forecast so far this year has been pretty good. Severity was higher than expected. But given the volatility of those percentages in the environment, we made sure there was enough margin in pricing and reduced expenses. So as a result, our absolute level of profitability was good and better than many of our competitors' reported results. So the overall goal, of course, is profitable growth. And the best way to manage that total is then you focus on the components, whether that's state-by-state, line by line, or inside the actual cost structure, so Glenn has established goals for the rest of the year on price increases, severity control, and expense reductions. And we have the processes, the math, and state managers that enable us to achieve and adapt, which is we have a consistent track record of doing. So I think when I see people making percentage changes over each quarter and looking at the percentage change of us versus the percentage change of competitors, I'm like when you got the numbers moving around this fast, you really have to go back to the absolute and say, \u201cdid you make money? How did you make money? And how do you make sure you keep making money going forward?\u201d With that let me turn it over Glenn, who can talk a little bit about what he's going to get planned for the rest of the year. Glenn Shapiro : Great. Thanks Tom. And Greg, if I go to the first part of your question on price position, the best measure of price competitiveness are close rates, and our closed rates are up. So we've seen a good result on the fact that for a few years, as Mario covered earlier, we've taken expenses out of the system, we've taken those expenses, and essentially allowed customers to get better value from us. And that's improving our close rates, which has helped. The second part, when you talked about going forward with frequency and severity, as Tom said, we have a pretty good forecast on frequency, and it's continued to be lower when you go on a two-year basis. The one-year comparisons right now are interesting on just about everything, but on a two-year basis to pre-pandemic, they continue to be meaningfully lower. Some of that will be just the new different world that we're in with fewer people working in office buildings and travelling in rush hour. Some of that will revert back over time, but we've had really good forecasts on that. The frequency has been higher. Sorry, the severity has been higher with inflationary factors. And so, we're looking at that and where we have to take pricing we will. And I guess, when you put them together the key is in how we've been forecasting, and when we look at when the line will cross. And what I mean by that is, we knew that look, severity compounds over time. So once you're a couple years in which we are now when you're comparing to 2019, you've got a couple of years of severity increases. At some point, it's going to be greater than the benefit that is persisting on frequency and you cross that line. And so, we're pretty good at forecasting about the time we're crossing that line. We moved prices slightly down. In some places, we're still good with those and we still have opportunity to even be more competitive. In other places, we're going to have to take them up. But we don't have wild swings happening in terms of our pricing. We've been pretty careful and cautious to do things that we thought were sustainable, and we're going to continue to do things that we think are sustainable. So as we take expenses out, continuing to do for the remainder of the year, the loss cost management that the claims team is doing and our pricing actions, we think there's more ground we can make up from a competitive position standpoint. Greg Peters : That was a very thorough answer. And I was going to ask a question on expenses. But I got to just follow up on your point on severity, and crossing the line. As you know, there's so much oxygen going on around inflationary pressures in the marketplace. And some of its viewed maybe perhaps being transitory, some of it being structural and longer term in nature. And I guess what I'm looking for from you guys is what's your view on the severity trends and can you give us some perspective on that crossing the line analogy that you used Glenn? Tom Wilson : Well Greg, we don't do forecasts of combined ratio, or the components of the combined ratio. But I think when you look at - it's interesting though, when you look at the supplement, you'll see the paid on property damages is down, that's not related to the way we're booking, they just happen to be paid and there's some timing. So when you look at severity has to be clear difference between what you pay, and what you think you're going to pay eventually. And so we think severity - we know severity is up this year, we booked it up both first quarter and second quarter, even a little more. But so Glenn's got factored into this pricing. Glenn, anything you want to say about the client, maybe talk a little bit about severity control. Glenn Shapiro : Yeah. And just to the point about what's transitory and what's in there. I think if you look at both frequency and severity in that way, like they're components of frequency, like we get really detailed into looking at the miles driven, it isn't just what was the total miles driven out there. It's, by state, it's urban versus rural, it's commuting time versus not, it's weekend versus week day and night day. So when we look at all of this, we have a view on what we believe is transitory and what is more sustainable on frequency as well as on severity. But the controls that we have, from a claims standpoint, we have a really strong claims team and they use first of all proprietary models that we have to escalate claims that either need to be expedited, moved faster or need to be prepared for defense in terms of injury claims. Tell us the likelihood of litigation, the likelihood of representation, things like that, we leverage our scale really well and that we have long-term pricing deals on a lot of the parts and labor that are out there for whether it's auto or home, so some of that acts as a hedge towards inflation. And it's not perfect, because we're in the same inflationary environment that others are in. But we do with our buying power have had good long-term deals that we've negotiated that help to hedge that to some degree and then really strong quality process that we manage across the system. So we feel good about our ability to manage within the environment, but also we have to price for it as it moves. And I guess I'll close by saying, if anything, our history is been proven, I would say, we do a really good job managing to our returns. And Mario and Tom talked about those in the opening quite a bit. We will manage to produce the right returns and when we need to take price to do that we do it. Greg Peters : Makes sense. Thank you for the answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler, your question, please. Paul Newsome : Good morning. A little bit more of a key off of those last questions. But one of the questions I'm getting a lot is whether or not there'll be sort of regulatory issues with auto in particular if we need to get more rate and I'd love to hear your thoughts on how that gets managed at Allstate. Tom Wilson : I'll maybe start with a little macro and then Glenn can talk about anything we're doing specifically. Paul, I think the first place I would start is the regulatory reaction tends to start with what consumers think. And consumers are in a pretty good place. Our customers are in pretty good place getting a billion dollars back last year. There's plenty - if you look at savings rates and cash and bank accounts and all kinds of stuff, consumers are not - have some pricing ability - there not a lot of pricing pressure coming from consumers each day, so again the count of percentage increases that we need or not so large, you're not talking about double digit price increases that cause everybody to call the insurance regulator and say I don't like this world. So we don't see a lot of consumer pushback. When you look at the regulators we have a good relationship with our regulators. I mean, we were 10 days in last year, I mean, Glenn, I think it was like 10 days into March, we were like we got to do something about this. So we went out proactively to regulators and said, we don't have a requirement to do this, we have no contractual requirement to do it. But we know you'll want us to do it. So we're going to do it in advance upfront and we led the industry in doing that. So we feel like we have good relationships with them, we've been balanced as to how we approach it. And we've been able to earn the economic rents in the marketplace and compete successfully. And Glenn anything, you want to talk about in terms of specifics. Glenn Shapiro : First, I think is a really good point with some of the credibility we earned last year, because it's not only the shift the return of the money, but the fact that we went out there and proactively had the idea to say, we're just going to waive the requirement that you have an endorsement to do deliveries, let's say with your car and turn your car into an economic vehicle for you, for people that were out of work. They appreciate the fact that we were thinking about the way people were having to live their lives and not having to go buy an endorsement to do it. And we just gave it away for free and filed that across 50 states and in a matter of days, and special payment plans, allowing people more time to pay. So I think we did build a lot of credibility with that. But I think the core of this is the regulators have actuaries. And we have actuaries, and they are math based. So this is - sometimes you get into some emotion with it, but it's really a fact based and math based situation. So when severities go up or loss ratios move their actuaries with our actuaries and we have great relationships working to that one. Tom Wilson : Yeah, when rental cars go from 50 bucks a day to $100 a day or used car prices go up 40%, regulators know you got to make - you got to collect more money to take care of that. Paul Newsome : Makes sense and I'd like to ask homeowners question. I tend to think that people underestimate the durability and impact of the home business. Can you just talk a little bit about what's going on there from a pricing and competitive perspective? And whether or not the outlook is more favorable overtime? But it does seem to be - if anything, it seems like you're selling more of it and seems like it's a lead product for you at the moment? Tom Wilson : Well, Paul, thank you for recognizing how successful we've been at home. Like there are days, when I feel like people think the only thing we sell is auto insurance. And like we make a lot of money in homeowners insurance, we're really good at it. It does require lower margins than auto insurance, because you got to put up a lot more capital because of the volatility. And you don't get a lot of investment income. So we've been very good at it. Glenn, do you want to talk about how we're doing this? Glenn Shapiro : Yeah, boy, do I. Yeah, I appreciate that Paul. We feel really good about where we are in homeowners. So I'll give you a quick number on the last five years, 89 combined ratio, that's recorded combined ratio not underlying, and we've made just over $4 billion in the past five years of underwriting profit. So we're good at this, I don't mind being bold enough to say that we - I think we have a sustained and systemic advantage in homeowners that we've proven over a long period of time. And it goes to the claims capabilities, the cap management capabilities, our reinsurance system that we have, our risk selection, our product capability and pricing. So it's a pretty deep skill that's been honed over a long period of time that we're able to leverage. And so when you look at there's no question that inflation is hitting the homeowner side hard and you got weather events. And you look at what it's doing to the industry more broadly than us. And there's going to be folks taking a lot of rate out there. And I think you've heard that from them. And our product is such that like, year-over-year, we're at 6% up on average premium, even though we took only three and a half points a rate because built into it, there's some inflationary factor. So we're really well positioned to continue to make money at it, protect a lot of people. And last point is it goes to what Tom talked about earlier about transformative growth. You look at the independent agent system. We bought National General primarily to really have a ticket into that system, where they have great systems, a lot of appointments, great relationships and they're good at some products. Well, we're really good at home. You get that home product into the IA channel. And I think it's going to sell well, we're going protect a lot of people we're going to help IAs grow. Paul Newsome : Thank you, I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from wine of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI, your question, please. David Motemaden : Hi, good morning. I had a question just on frequency. And I guess it's a question maybe you can clarify how that trended throughout the quarter by month? And maybe just talk about what you're seeing today. And should we be thinking about frequency being more flat with 2019, combined with 14% to 15% severity increase versus '19 that you guys called out in the 10-Q? Tom Wilson : David, I'll get Glenn to answer the question on frequency. I'm not sure where that 14% to 15% came from, but and how you've factored. What period of time you're focused, is that two years and then one year? Because you can't take a two year trend and extrapolate it onto annual trends is, maybe that's what I heard. But Glenn do you want to talk just about frequency? Glenn Shapiro : Sure. Yeah. No, I would not - the short answer would be I would not say you should just expect a zero frequency trend relative to 2019. Well, we don't publish any forecasting on frequency. I think, broadly people in the industry have talked about the fact that safer cars have tended to have a little bit of a tailwind for frequency, even take away the pandemic for a moment that year-over-year we've had a long-term steady decline in frequency. And so you've got a couple of years of data as you compare to 2019. On top of that, we see and I alluded to this a little bit before, we see a really material change in the way people are driving. So even when you see the aggregate number of miles driven coming back still lower, but closer to 2019 levels. Who is driving, when they're driving and how they're driving is changing materially? So you see about a four or five point difference between the net change of urban driving being down more than rural driving. So you look at an Allstate book of business where we sell predominantly through exclusive agents or solicit agents or in more populated markets that tends to favor the way the frequency comes through. You look at the type of driving that's done, I mentioned before commuting is down significantly more than non-commuting. So quick stat for us, we look at a lot of these details. Weekend driving is actually higher right now than 2019 was. People just want to get out. Weekday driving is materially lower and particularly in rush hour. So when you see less congested roads in the time period, when the predominance of accidents happen in those morning and afternoon commutes that is helpful to particularly in our book of business, the way frequency comes through. So there are elements that will come back, it will come back differently and it is the only thing I'm confident in saying is that the world will look exactly the same after the pandemic than before. And that will mean that people drive and move differently. We see some non-transitory or temporary impacts to frequency. David Motemaden : Got it, okay, thanks and Tom, yes, yeah, I was referring to just Page 63 of the 10-Q, which is, yeah, that 14% to 15% is over two years. So you're right. It's about 7% on average per year. I guess, just a follow up just on the rate actions that you're thinking about taking? I just saw, I think it was like a 5% rate increase that you filed in Georgia recently. Maybe could you just talk about how widespread the rate increases are that you want to put in and maybe just talk a bit more about how you think that might impact the growth trajectory going forward? Tom Wilson : Well, we don't - we've got - we got plans for the rest of the year is where we think we need to increase price. But we don't give those out for competitive reasons. And we also need to bring traders to agree. So I would just say that we think we will. You should rely on the fact David that we know how to make money and we're focused on making money. As to the competitive business I think it depends what other people do. So you heard yesterday if you listen to the Progressive call they're all in on raising prices, cutting advertising, changing underwriting stuff. So we think that gives us room to adapt and continue to grow, and make money and make sure that we can recover costs as they go up. Other competitors are in different places. But we feel good about where we're at, like trades for growth. Like if you start off and said, would you want to - have a pandemic and a huge drop in frequency for a year to do transformative growth? You probably would say, I don't know, like it's a lot of volatility to manage. On the other hand, I think in our particular case, it's worked well for us. David Motemaden : Got it. Thank you. Is it your sense that the rest of the industry is going to start raising prices? Tom Wilson : If you look at what they've done then we can really focus on and there have been more rate increases this year than I think probably people would have predicted if you asked them in the fourth quarter of last year. And that would include us, like if you just said, what do we think everybody was going to do this year? We wouldn't have thought they had to go up as much as they did. But we also didn't think severity was going to be as high as it is. So we're increasing ours, and they're increasing theirs. But we think our relative advantage, given our sophistication in pricing, given our reduction in expenses, given what we're doing on the long-term basis to get expenses down even farther, puts us in good place. So we don't see anything happening that tells us we can't still be on the path to grow market share. The specific roads we go down might be a little different. But we're still feeling like that goal is still there or the objective is still achievable. David Motemaden : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Meyer Shields from KBW, your question, please. Meyer Shields : Thanks. I wanted to dig in a little bit to Allstate direct, I just want understand the thought on the pricing strategy. And what I mean by that is I think we've got demographic trends favoring direct distribution, but also to massive competitors and I wanted to know whether the competitive posture is that you have to be in line with where Progressive and GEICO are? Or can you benefit enough from these demographic trends to achieve your growth goals. Tom Wilson : I'm trying to sort through Meyer - the first direct should be priced for what you get like you should get what you pay for. So when you buy Allstate direct, it's I think on average, about 7% lower than if you buy from an agent because it doesn't come with health, and so it's you get what you pay for. And there are people - there are some demographic shifts there. But some of it's not - there are some young people who want help and some older people who don't want help. And so where their focus is not as much on demographics of those channels, but it is the customer value. As it relates to our competitive position in each channel, we believe you should have a competitive price position in each channel, like-for-like, so if you're buying from GEICO or Progressive and you're buying direct and you're buying from Allstate, you're buying direct, you should - it should be the same kind of value. Now, it gets a little dicier when you figure out prices because what the limits are and all kinds of - it's complicated fast. But the conceptual approach would be, be competitive in channel based on the value you deliver to shareholders, or the customers. Glenn how would you - is there other things you'd add to that? Glenn Shapiro : Yeah. Going to the point about what do we get out just the demographic shift versus being more competitive? Clearly, it's a growing channel. So if you are - if you're sitting in the boat and the current is taking you in a certain direction, so that there's something to, you really should be there, and that's why we're there. It's why transformative growth, why we wanted to be in all channels and where customers want to buy. So I think there's some benefit to that. But the bigger benefit is two other things. One would be being competitively priced, why we're going after expenses, why we did the pricing differential that Tom talked about. And then the third one, which frankly, maybe even the most important is just your execution in it and it's the fact that it we have used the capabilities of insurance, but we're still newer at being a large national player with the brand we've got of Allstate doing this is building the capabilities whether it's web, our sales processes, marketing sophistication, integration of marketing into it. So that we are winning our fair share there because you got to get the price to be competitive, but you also have to be great at the process itself. Tom Wilson : So as we go back to that slide where we showed the three different channels, direct is up, as we said it's not 29% of sales, we expected to continue to go up as Glenn said, as we get better. There are some shifts to that channel if you just look globally, some of that's because more people feel comfortable buying over the web and not going through some of that. Some of it is just because direct is a whole bunch of advertising and it drives people to it. But we're, as Glenn pointed out in that boat and increasing our capabilities. But that doesn't mean we're waving the flag on people-to-people exchange. And so the key part of transformer growth is, there are people who want help. We just need to give it them at a lower cost. And that's what we're working on. So people were more than happy to pay a lot of money - not lot, but to be paid for help to buy the insurance, they just don't want to pay you 10% for ongoing service when they can do self-service, it is not much to be done or you can do at a lower cost centrally. So that's our shift and transformer. We're not waving the flag on person-to-person sales. In fact, we're leaning in and saying we have a great position here, we have a great brand, people know us, we just need to do it more effectively and create higher growth models. So that will take us some time to transition. As we talked about, like I don't expect the Allstate agent business to jump up the way you'll see the direct business increase over the next 12 months. But I do think it's got great long-term potential. And we're investing heavily in making sure those agents can deliver what people want if they want help buying products. Meyer Shields : Okay, that was quite helpful. Thank you. A quick follow up if I can, has the - I guess recent severity issues in both auto and home, have those changed the timeline for rolling out the standard products on National General's platform? Tom Wilson : Short answer would be no, we think we can be really competitive in that market. And we're excited to get into the independent agent channel and do it as quickly as we can. We'll have some of our middle market products this year on the NatGen platform branded as National General and Allstate Company. So we'll get the benefit of the endorsed brand. And then over the next two years, we'll be rolling that out as quickly as we can. Meyer Shields : Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley, your question please. Michael Phillips : Hey, thanks. Good morning. In your introductory comments on severity, you talked about some other ways to counter it besides the target price increases, could you expand upon maybe how those will help severity issues, I didn't really get all the lists you were talking about maybe go through those little more detail and talk about how they can help you counter severity besides price? Tom Wilson : Sure. Thanks, Michael. It really is about claims capabilities and paying what you owe, in being fair to folks. But making sure you don't pay more than you owe as things move. So we have inflationary factors, for example, say on materials for homeowners, having purchasing power, and having really good deals in place over the long-term on flooring, on roofing, and other products used in home repair, helps hedge that inflation. And with our size, with our buying power and with the capabilities of our claims team, we've been able to do that helps hedge it. Again, I'm not suggesting it eliminates the problem of inflation. But it does help mitigate it so that not all of that cost is passed through to your customers. Because in our view the job to our customers, obviously we got to put them back to where they were. We've got to charge people an appropriate price and give them the best value possible. And part of that is mitigating the cost of claims. So that was in the purchasing power. The proprietary models I mentioned before, is we've just invested a lot in our analytics and data capabilities over the years in order to flag claims that were at risk for accelerating costs so that we could get it into the right experts hands at the right time and it allows us to do a better quality job on those and also manage the costs. Michael Phillips : Okay, thank you for that. One other quick one if I could then, you had a lot of talk on the direct to consumer channel for auto and clearly that's a growth area. What's your view on that channel longer term for the homeowners market? Tom Wilson : We think it's good. I mean, I think people do want sometimes a little more help on their home because they care more about their home. But we think that those people who are comfortable using advanced technology, bots, chat on assets you can get online should be able to buy more homes direct. Michael Phillips : Okay, cool. Thank you. Tom Wilson : Thank you for taking the time. Maybe just close on a few things first on investment results. I totally understand the view that one would not fully count the huge increase in performance spacing. But when I read some of the reports, I'm like I think it's fair to say it was an outsize quarter. But that doesn't mean that our long-term results should be ignored. We're good in investments we had good results. Our acquisitions are performing well, whether that be Allstate protection plans, which we didn't really get questions on today. I just want to remind you we bought that company four years ago at $1.4 billion. It's now over a billion dollars in revenue. It's growing at 27% a year. It made $155 million, which means we paid nine times earnings for business that is growing 27%. So we think it's worth a lot more than that. National General, we also think will be highly successful. But we're off to a really good start there. You can see that in the current numbers. And it's not just the 4 million policies we added. By the way, when you look at the net cash, we had the layout after a stretch to our capital. I do not believe we could have acquired 1% market share by putting a couple of billion dollars into advertising. So we think it was also just an economic growth opportunity straight up, forget the strategic potential for the growth. And then share repurchases we continue to really do well. This is the biggest share repurchase program we've ever announced both in dollars and percentage of market capitalization that's build up. So, thank you for participating today. We had great results this quarter. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mark Nogal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Nogal : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and we posted related materials to our website @allstateinvestors.com. our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and the investor supplement and forward-looking statements on Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2020 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Well, good morning and thank you for investing your time with us today. Let's start on Slide 2. This is Allstate strategy on the left-hand side, which we've talked about before. We have two components; increased personal profit liability market share, and expanded protection solutions. And those are the two ovals you see on the left with the intersection between. The key third quarter results are highlighted on the right-hand panel. Property-liability policies and force increased by 12.5%. Allstate Protection Plans continue to grow rapidly by both broadening its product offering and expanding the network of retail providers. As a result, we now have almost a 192 million policies force across the [Indiscernible]. Financially, the results were more mixed. Revenues were up substantially, but net income and adjusted net income declined from the prior year quarter. Underwriting income declined primarily due to higher loss costs of settling auto insurance claims. We've implemented price increases to proactively respond to the sharp rise in loss costs and transformative growth continues to position us for long-term success, both of which we'll talk about in a couple of minutes. This was partially offset by the benefits from our long-term risk and return program that includes significant reinsurance recoverable, they were primarily related to Hurricane Ida, and a substantial increase in performance-based investment income. Capital deployment results were excellent with a billion-and-a-half dollars in cash return to shareholders in the quarter. We also completed the divestitures of our two largest life and annuity businesses, one in October and then one just earlier this week. So let's go to Slide 3. Revenues of $12.5 billion in the quarter increased 16.9% compared to the prior-year quarter. And that reflects both the higher earned premiums in National General acquisition. Allstate brand homeowners premium growth, and higher net investment income, property liability premiums, and policies and force increased 13.5%, and 12.5% respectively. Net investment income was $764 million, and that's up almost [Indiscernible] by $300 million compared to the prior-year quarter, reflecting strong results from the performance-based portfolio. Net Income was $508 million in the quarter. And that's compared to a billion 1 in the prior quarter as lower underwriting income was partially offset by the higher investment income. Adjusted net income was $217 million or $0.73 per diluted share and decreased $683 million compared to the prior-year quarter, reflecting the lower underwriting income due to the higher auto and homeowners insurance loss costs. Net income for the first 9 months of 2021 was below the prior year, and it's largely due to the loss on the sale of the life annuity business which we recorded earlier in the year. Adjusted net income was $10.70 per share for the first nine months. That was above the prior year as higher investment income and lower expenses, more than offset higher loss costs. Let's turn to slide 4. How I would do is put the pandemic in the longitudinal perspective because this created volatility for our results. And it obviously requires us to adapt quickly, which we do. But before we go through the impact on the third quarter results of the supply chain disruptions, let's talk about the initial and subsequent impact of the pandemic. So in 2020, the economic lockdown resulted in fewer miles being driven and promoted -- and prompted an aggressive economic support response from really governments around the world. The impact on auto insurance was a dramatic drop in the number of accidents. And of course, due to this unprecedented driving frequency, we've proactively provided our customers with some money back which increased customer retention. Since then, and since there was less road congestion and fewer accidents that occurred during commuting hours, the average speed in severity of auto claims increased, offsetting some of the frequency benefits. Nevertheless, underwriting margins improved dramatically, so we introduced a temporary shelter in place payback rather than take a permanent rate reduction, and took some modest overall reductions in rate level. This year, as you can see from the right-hand column, the story has been just the opposite as it relates to frequency, with large percentage increases. And while the overall level of accident frequency for the Allstate brand is still below pre -pandemic levels, the national and general non-standard business is back to the levels before the pandemic. Auto severity this year, however, has been dramatically impacted by the supply chain disruption and price increases on used cars and original equipment parts in Mario will take you through that in a couple of slides. From a pricing perspective, this results in moving from modest rate reductions to significant increases on auto insurance prices. From a growth standpoint at the off set of the pandemic, we begin to see material increase in the consumer acceptance to telematics. And we've really leaned into that with our Milewise product, which is really the only national product out there to pay for the mile. And that's led to substantial increase in debt telematics products. Now, the pandemic has also had a significant impact on the investment portfolio and this is a tale of the beginning of the end as well. So early in the crisis, equity valuations were down and it had a negative impact on investment results. Then of course, we have a broad-based long-term spread out over a decade, really investing in these kinds of funds. And so we do it on a long-term basis, whether that's 3, 5, or 10 years. But so what's happened this year, of course, is we've had the opposite happen, which is with the economic stimulus, we've had equity evaluations going after and our returns have come back strongly. In the market-based portfolio, lower interest rates at the onset of this pandemic did lead to an increase in the unrealized gains in the portfolio. But of course, what that does is reduce future interest rate income, which you see slight decline in this quarter. And many of our other businesses that have been impacted, some positively, some negatively. But it's our ability to adapt and seize the opportunities that are presented that create shareholder result So Mario will now go through the third quarter results in more detail and how transformative growth positions Allstate for continued success. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Tom. Let's move to Slide 5 to review property-liability margin results in the third quarter. The recorded combined ratio of 105.3 increased 13.7 points compared to the prior year quarter. This was primarily driven by increased underlying losses, as well as higher catastrophe losses and non-catastrophe prior year reserve re-estimates. The chart at the bottom of the slide quantifies the impact of each component in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. As you can see, the personal auto underlying loss ratio drove most of the increase, due to higher auto accident frequency and the inflationary impacts on auto severity. Higher catastrophe losses shown in the middle of the chart, had a negative 1.4 impact on the combined ratio, as favorable reserve re-estimates recorded in 2020 from wildfires subrogation settlements, positively impacted the prior year quarter. Gross catastrophe losses were higher, but were reduced by nearly $1 billion of net reinsurance recoveries following Hurricane Ida, demonstrated the benefits of our long-term approach to risk and return management of the homeowners insurance business and our comprehensive reinsurance program. Non-catastrophe prior-year reserve strengthening of a $162 million in the quarter drove an adverse impact of 0.8 points, primarily from increases in auto and commercial lines. This also included $111 million of strengthening in the quarter related to asbestos, environmental, and other reserves in the runoff property-liability segment, following our annual comprehensive reserve review. This was partially offset by a lower expense ratio when excluding the impact of amortization of purchased intangibles, primarily due to lower restructuring and related charges compared to the prior-year quarter. Moving to Slide 6, let's go a bit deeper on auto insurance profitability. Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio finished at 97.5 for the quarter and 89.7 over the first 9 months of 2021. The increase to the prior year quarter reflects higher loss -- loss costs due to higher accident frequency, increased severity, and competitive pricing enhancements implemented in late 2020 and earlier this year. While claim frequency increased relative to prior year, we continue to experience favorable trends relative to pre -pandemic levels. Allstate brand auto property damage frequency increased 16.6% compared to 2020, but decreased 16.8% relative to 2019. The chart on the lower left compares the underlying combined ratio for the third quarter of 2019 to this quarter, to remove some of the short-term pandemic volatility. The underlying combined ratio was 93.1 in 2019, which generates an attractive return on capital. Favorable auto frequency in the third quarter of 2021, lowered the combined ratio by 6.4 points compared to 2019. Increased auto claim severity, however, increased the combined ratio by 12 points versus 2 years ago, as you can see from the red bar. The cost reductions implemented as part of transformative growth, reduced expenses by 1.3 points, which favorably impacted 2021 results. As Tom mentioned, early in the pandemic, the severity increases were driven by higher average losses due to a reduction in low severity claims. This year, the increase reflects the impact of supply chain disruptions in the auto markets, which has increased used car prices and enabled original equipment manufacturers to significantly increased part prices. The chart on the lower right, shows used car values began increasing above the CPI in late 2020, which accelerated in 2021, resulting in an increase of 44% since the beginning of 2019. Similarly, OEM parts have also increased in 2021, roughly twice as much as core CPI. This has resulted in higher severities for both total loss vehicles and repairable vehicles. Since these increases were accelerating throughout the second and third quarters of the year, we Increased expected loss costs for the first 2 quarters of 2021. And this prior quarter strengthening shows up in the combined ratio for the third quarter. Increases in report year severities for auto insurance claims during the first two quarters of 2021, increased the third quarter combined ratio by 2.6 points, as you can see by the green bar on the lower left. So let's flip to Slide 7, which lays out the steps we're taking to improve auto profitability. As you can see from the chart on the top, Allstate has maintained industry-leading auto insurance margins over a long period of time with a combined ratio operating range in the mid-90s, exhibiting strong execution and operational expertise. To maintain industry-leading results, we are increasing rates, improving claims effectiveness, and continuing to lower costs. After lowering prices in early 2021 to reflect in part Allstate 's lower expense ratio, we have proactively been responding with increases in the third quarter with actions continuing into the fourth quarter and into 2022. The chart on the right provides selected rate increases already implemented in the third and Fourth Quarter, as well as publicly filed rates that have yet to be implemented in the Fourth Quarter. Those states denoted with a carrot, our top ten states in terms of written premium as of year-end 2020 in the third quarter we received rate approvals for increases in 12 states, primarily in September. We adapted quickly to higher severities in the Fourth Quarter with plans to file rates in an additional 20 states. We have already implemented rate increases in 8 states during the Fourth Quarter with an average increase of 6.7% 7% as of November first, looking ahead, we expect to pursue price increases in an additional 12 locations by year-end. We are working closely with state regulators to provide detailed support and decrease the lag time between filing, implementation, and premium generation. As we move into next year, it is likely auto insurance prices will continue to be increased to reflect higher severities. We also continue to leverage advanced claims capabilities and process efficiencies. Cost reductions as part of transformative growth will also continue to be implemented. Let's turn to slide 8 and discuss our expectations and commitment to further improve our cost structure through transformative growth. As you can see by the chart on the bottom of the slide, we've defined a new non-GAAP measure this quarter, referred to as the adjusted expense ratio. This starts with our underwriting expense ratio excluding restructuring, coronavirus related expenses, amortization, and impairment of purchased intangibles, and investments in advertising. It then also adds in our claim expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims, which tend to be more variable. We believe this measure provides the best insight into the underlying expense trends within our Property-liability business. Through innovation and strong execution, we achieved 2.6 points of improvement when comparing 2020 to 2018 with further improvement occurring through the first 9 months of 2021. Over time, we expect to drive an additional three points of improvement from current levels achieving an adjusted expense ratio of approximately 23 by year-end 2024. This represents about a 6 point reduction relative to 2018 or an average of 1 point per year over 6 years, enabling an improved price position relative to our competitors. While maintaining attractive returns. Future cost reductions center around continued digital enhancements to automate processes enabling the retirement of legacy technology. Operating efficiency gains from combining organization, combining organizations and transforming the distribute -- the distribution model to higher growth and lower cost. Transitioning to slide 9, let's go up a level to show how transformative growth positions us for long-term success and how the components of transformative growth work together to create a flywheel of profitable growth. As you know, transformative growth is a multiyear initiative to increase personal property - liability market share, by building a low cost digital insurer with broad distribution. This will be accomplished by improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition, and deploying a new technology ecosystem. We've made significant progress to date, across each component. Starting at the top of the flywheel visual, our commitment to further lower our costs, improves customer value and enables a more competitive price position while maintaining attractive returns. Enhancing and expanding distribution puts us in a position to take advantage of more affordable pricing. Increasing the analytical sophistication of new customer acquisitions let's cus -- let's consumers know about this better value proposition. New technology platforms' lower costs, has enable us to further broaden the solutions offered to property-liability customers. This flywheel will enable us to increase market share and create additional shareholder value. Turning to Slide 10, let's look at the changes to the distribution system, which are also underway. As you can see in the chart on the left side of the slide, Property-liability policies in force grew by 12.5% compared to the prior-year quarter. National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of 4 million policies and Allstate brand property liability policies increased by 231,000, driven by growth across personal lines. Allstate brand auto policies enforce increased slightly compared to the prior-year quarter. And sequentially for the third consecutive quarter, including growth of 142,000 policies compared to prior year-end. As you can see by the table on the lower left. The chart on the right shows a breakdown of personal auto new issued applications compared to the prior year. The middle section of the right chart shows Allstate brand impacts by channel, which in total generated a 5% increase in new business growth compared to the prior year. A 38% increase in the direct channel more than offset a slight decline from existing agents and volume that would have normally been generated by newly appointed agents. As you know, we significantly reduced the number of new Allstate agents being appointed beginning in early 2020, since we are developing a new agent model to drive higher growth at lower-cost. The addition of National General also added 502 thousand new auto applications in the quarter. Let me now turn it over to Mark to cover the remainder of the slides before we move to Q&A. Mark Nogal : Thanks Mario. Moving to Slide 11, protection services continues to grow revenue and profit. Revenues, excluding the impact of realized gains and losses, increased 23.3% to $597 million in the third quarter. Protection Plans, net written premium increased by a $139 million due to the launch of the Home Depot relationships, focusing on appliances. Our quarterly net written premium is now 5.5 times the level of when the Company was acquired in 2017. Already expanded revenues due to the integration of LeadCloud and Transparently., which were acquired as part of the national general acquisition, as well as increased device sales driven by growth in the milewest product. Policies and force increased 12.5% to a 150 million driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans and Allstate identity protection. Adjusted net income was $45 million in the third quarter, representing an increase of $5 million compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by higher profitability at Allstate identity protection in Arity. This was partially offset by higher operating costs and expenses related to investments and growth. Now let's shift to Slide 12, which highlights our investment performance. Net investment income totaled $764 million in the quarter, which was $300 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance-based income as shown in the chart on the left. Performance-based income totaled $437 million in the quarter, as shown in gray, reflecting increases in private equity investments. As in prior quarters, several large idiosyncratic contributors had a meaningful impact on our results. These results represent a long-term and broad approach to growth investing, with nearly 90% of year-to-date performance-based income coming from assets with inception years of 2018 and prior. Market-based income, shown in blue, was $6 million below the prior-year quarter. The impact of reinvestment rates below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield, was somewhat mitigated in the quarter by higher average assets under management and prepayments fee income. Our total portfolio return was 1% in the third quarter and 3.3% year-to-date, reflecting income and changes in equity valuations partially offset by higher interest rates. We take an active approach to optimizing our returns per unit risk for appropriate investment horizons. Our investment activities are integrated into our overall enterprise risk and return process, and play an important role in generating shareholder value. While the performance-based investment results continued to be strong in the third quarter, we manage the portfolio with a longer-term view on returns. On the right, we have provided our annualized portfolio return in total, and by strategy over various time horizons. Consistent with broader public and private equity markets, our portfolio has experienced returns above our historical trend over the last several quarters. While prospective returns will depend on future economic and market conditions, we do expect our performance-based returns to moderate in line with our longer-term results. Now let's move to Slide 13, which highlights Allstate strong capital position. Allstate's balance sheet strength and excellent cash flow generation, provides strong cash returns to shareholders while investing in growth. Significant cash returns to shareholders, including $1.5 billion through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends occurred during the third quarter. Common shares outstanding have been reduced by 5% over the last 12 months. Already in the fourth quarter we successfully completed the acquisition of safe auto on October 1st for $262 million to leverage National General's integration capabilities and further increased personal lines market share. We also recently closed on the divestitures of Allstate Life Insurance Company in New York. These divestitures free up approximately $1.7 billion of deployable capital, which was factored into the $5 billion share repurchase program currently being executed. Turning to Slide 14, let's finish with a longer-term view of Allstate's focus on execution, innovation, and sustainable value creation. Allstate has an excellent track record of serving customers, earning attractive returns on risks, and delivering for shareholders, as you can see by the industry-leading statistics on the upper right. Innovation is also critical to the execution, and our proactive implementation of transformative growth has positioned us well to address the macroeconomic challenges facing our business today and in the future. Sustainable value creation also requires excellent capital management and governance. As an example, Allstate is in the top 15% of S&P 500 companies and cash returns to shareholders by providing an attractive dividend and repurchasing 25% and 50% of outstanding shares over the last 5 and 10 years respectively. Execution, innovation, and long-term value creation will continue to drive increased shareholder value. With that context, let's open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Josh Inc. from Bank of America. Your question, please. Joshua Shanker : Yes. Thank you. I want to talk about bundles and homeowners in the pricing of the dual engine of homeowners and auto together. I guess there's two things I want to understand. One is when a customer sees their overall bundled price going up, what does the conversation like, especially if you're trying to more centralized your business with a greater direct relationship with your customers. And 2, given Allstate's geographic footprint, can Allstate add incoming customers for homeowners without changing its cap footprint. Tom Wilson : Good morning, Josh is Tom, I'll start and then Glenn can jump in first as you know, we've long been focused on bundling auto and homeowners because those are good, stable, long-term customers. You do get a discount for putting those two together. So there's an advantage to the customer from buying it and putting it all in one place besides just having 1 point of contact. And we've been good at that. If you look at our growth in Homeowners this year. It's higher than our growth in auto insurance. And data appears to be because we are doing more bundling of individual customers, it a little hard to get the exact attribution, but we feel good about what our agents are doing to drive that. As it relates to the Gross event. We've been we've repositioned as business over multiple years back in the middle -- late 2 thousand decade of 2,000, we've made of course a bunch of money since over the last eight or nine years, I think almost $9 billion of underwriting income on homeowners which you need to do because we don't believe that a 4 point margin is attractive for homeowners for a couple of reasons. One is you don't get much investment income. Secondly, you got to put up more capital because the results are more volatile and you have the big tail losses. So as we seek to grow it, we bring all of that math to bear. On individual states is where we grow. And so if there's a state where even if there's a fair amount of catastrophe exposure but we think we can get a good return, that's got a margin on it that compensates us for the capital we have to put up and the reinsurance we have to buy, then we'll do that. And we're highly sophisticated in the way we run it. So the geographic focus is really -- we have a much highly sophisticated model into it. On the direct business, you don't sell as much direct homeowners right now, we still need to crack the code on that. Before I -- Glenn will have some view on how we can continue to run the table in homeowners as we have so far. But the -- an upcoming thing that Glenn might want to touch on, is what we're doing in the independent agent channel because of the National General platform gives us, with our products, our expertise, our pricing, our claims management. And our reinsurance programs gives us the ability to really serve a lot of customers. [Indiscernible] Joshua Shanker : Glenn, where [Indiscernible] I just want to say, can you address retention and cat footprints as well? Tom Wilson : Yeah. Glenn, mind if you take both of those? Glenn Shapiro : Sure. So a few comments on homeowners leading into it, but we got a really strong home care business and so we want to grow it, and we want to handle it as Tom said. So, over the course of the past year, we've deepened bundling discounts. So we've made it more attractive for customers across 30 states. We've shifted our agency competition over the last couple of years to where it's more attractive for them to bundle. And the same is true in direct, as Tom said, we're looking to crack the code right board there. Were writing some, We want to write more, and so some of the incentives for our direct team around cross quoting and bundling. To the point around that footprint, We're in good shape. Like, if you look at our ability to write business, we can write it pretty broadly. We can write in some CAT-prone areas, but we tend to offset it and create the diversity of our book by writing in other areas. I mean, right now, we're on a 12-month view right now, we're at 93.8 combined ratio made about $400 million underwriting profit in the last 12 months, in spite of having some really big CAT quarters. Though it's a good business that we're able to consistently make money in, and so we're looking to grow it. But as Tom said, we have -- we have pretty stringent guidelines, that where we write, how we write so that we don't overgrown in CAT prone areas. But we're able to grow without that and Tom mentioned something that I want to come back to. In terms of the breadth of our distribution and growing and that would be into our IA channel. You know, the IA channel is a huge opportunity. Independent agents where a lot of homeowners and our National General and Allstate's Company, as it will be branded, is adding our middle market products, both auto and home. And we have sort of a whole new Greenfield there to run in. And that would be a broad geographic spread, not just the cat prone areas. Tom Wilson : Hey [Indiscernible] let me just ask that because I think I understand why you're trying to triangulate between what's going on in the industry. First, we don't have a catastrophe exposure problem. We don't have a profitability problem. We believe in homeowners. We only made about -- we lost about $16 million bucks and $7.3 billion so far this year. So we'd like to make more money, but as Glenn pointed out, when you look over a longer period of time, we've had a fair amount of ups and downs, but we still make underwriting profit sense of 12-month basis. So we don't have a catastrophe problem. So we don't have to restrict stuff and end up with -- what you're poking at is retention issues. We have been there and done that though And it was called the repositioning we did in the latter part of the decade I mentioned. And when you call a customer and say, I used to have -- you used to be insured with us and now I am not going to insure your thoughts and we were one of the biggest brokers have homeowners insurance products. I think in the country and maybe Vegas. And through our advantage in even when you say to people, here's another Company. It has some impact on your auto business. So because people are like, Well, I'll take my business someplace else or competitors decide they want to, they want to bundle and they'll go get those customers as well. We had some issues with auto growth when we were downsizing. We went down by 2 million policies in the homeowner's business over a 4, 5 year-period. It does hurt. It's manageable. I can't speak for what our competitors are going to do. What I do know is what Glenn said, which is we got a good business, we know how to run it. We have growth opportunities, and we're looking forward to serving more customers and make more money for our shareholders along the way. Joshua Shanker : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please. Greg Peters : Good morning. I'd like to turn your attention to Page 7, and I was particularly struck by your chart where you've identified the rate increases you've deployed, and then ones that you're going to be implementing. And I was wondering if you could provide us some perspective on -- given the fact that severity has been so substantial, where you think that's going to go with other states? It feels like this is going to be an ongoing reset of pricing as we go through most of next year. And against that backdrop, just how you think about your competitive positioning when most of the industry is going to be raising rates. Tom Wilson : Let me -- maybe -- let me start and then, Glenn, why don't you jump in on what you are doing individually. I think you are right about that. There seems to be this -- a threat going through the markets today. And this is kind of a once and done. And we don't necessarily see it that way. I mean, I think there's never bold enough to decide in claim, we're ahead or of anybody else. Because firstly, I'd assumes everybody is in the same place. Secondly, assumes the same trends are going to happen and third is that those trends are going to end and the answer is we don't know when they will do. What we do know is what we can do differently. And we do know that some of our competitors had frequency increases sooner than we did so that you would expect them to raise prices sooner than we did. We do think that we have a good plan in place and Glenn can take you through that, which is to make sure we get attractive returns in auto insurance, which is a key component of what we do in terms of delivering value for shareholders. We are all over that and we will go -- where -- how that will move forward in terms of competitive position. And that's also hard to tell, what I do know is that I'm really glad we started transformative growth 2 years ago. And the cost reductions we already have in place certainly have benefited us. It's positioned us to be able to grow through many different venues, so we can dial growth up if we choose to do that. I'm really glad we are where we are and we're positioned to take share in the future, which of course, our strategy. But we want to do that profitably. Glenn, do you want to talk about your plans getting the auto insurance returns back to where they have been historically? Glenn Shapiro : Yes. Absolutely. So thanks, Greg. And you hit a couple of important points that you're right about that everyone or close to everyone is going to have to take rate. When you talk about competitive position. So we think about that as part of process. But this is broad and this is going to be around for a while, like everything you look at in terms of what the root causes of severity, which is in its simplest terms, is the price of used cars. I would like to talk about collision coverage as it's a coverage that doesn't really have a policy limit that's dated other than the value of the vehicle itself. So in real turn, our policy limit on that coverage went up by 40% plus with no change in premium. And that experience happened to everybody across the industry. So it's a rarity where you have something is Clean and clean as that that is a root cause to your severity changes. So we think it will be around for a bit and we're going after rate to address that has one of the levers and we've talked about our claims capabilities and certainly our expense reductions as other ones. So in the third quarter, we took 12 price increases that went effective in the third quarter and other 8 in the fourth quarter so far with more to come. So this is broad and we'll be doing it just about everywhere. And I think the key from a competitive position is that we made a lot progress. So our starting point, we made significant progress over the last year with the expenses we've taken out, and therefore the competitive position we were in improved significantly. Our close rates improved significantly, leading to some of the greater new business that you saw. And so as we take rates and other due. It's our goal certainly keep that competitive position gain that we've made. But the primary goal is to get our margins back to where they need to be. And that's why we're going after rate, we're doing it pretty proactively. Greg Peters : Great. Thanks for the color on that. I wanted to pivot to Slide 8, which is, I think another really important slide in your presentation. And just to step back and recognize the long-term objective that you've introduced is pretty striking. I feel like when we get to 2024, if you've achieved that objective, that will put you clearly among the leaders in terms of a lowest adjusted expense ratio in the marketplace. I'm sure a lot of thought went into this. Can you give us some more color on where the improvement, where you're going to get the most leverage in terms of the expense ratio improvements, where it's going to come from. And then maybe also include some comments on the advertising expense because that's not included in this. Tom Wilson : Mario, do you want to start with the components of the cost reduction and now come back to advertisement? Mario Rizzo : Sure. So Greg, thanks for the question and the acknowledgement of the progress we've made. I guess, why it start is maybe to just kind of go up a level and reiterate again what our objective in reducing costs really is, which is to enhance customer value by improving our competitive price position. And we're going to do that by continuing to drive down the expense component of our combined ratio, which is inclusive of both underwriting and claim expenses and to your point, we've made really good progress over the past several years. And in addition to the progress we've made, we've created plans and have line of sight to the additional 3-point objective that we've got by 2024, by focusing on things like digitizing processes to improve efficiency by continuing -- as we do that, create opportunity to retire legacy technology to capture the synergies associated with the National General acquisition, to continue to drive down distribution costs as we've talked about creating a more productive but lower-cost distribution model. So we've got opportunity in both the -- from an operating cost perspective and both the underwriting and the claim side. And we've got a plan on how to get there, and that's why we established a goal and we think once we can get the additional 3 points out of our cost structure, it's really going to position us well relative to our competitors, to have a more competitive price point, to deliver higher customer value and really position ourselves to accelerate growth. Tom Wilson : So let me go to advertising then. Let me start with we didn't do transformative growth because of the pandemic, but boy, I am sure glad we got started on transformative growth when we did because we were able to reposition the brand. We invested over $250 million in repositioning the brand, do advertising, testing out new, more sophisticated ways to do it. And we did it when frequency was low, so we were able to use some of that reduction in frequency, the margin it's created, to invest in long-term growth by repositioning the brand. When you look at transfer on breast for a simple right, you get a more competitive price, you have more places to buy it. You let people know about that the increase in advertising, that or restocking that. What we do in the future will be depending how much we want to grow. So as we move forward, I think our advertising will be flat or come down some, because we want to make sure we've got the pricing right. The point that came up earlier about the longevity of the how long will severity keep come up. You want to make sure you've got that pricing right before you go out and get that flywheel going by doing more advertising. That said, we're always going to do a lot of advertising because as you know, it is a marketing war really out there between some of the large players. But the other part that's not as well known is it's getting every bit as sophisticated as auto insurance in home prices. You really got to be good with your math and whether it's upper funnel, lower funnel, getting the right price to the right customer, at the right time, in the right space is complicated. And so the other thing we've been working on is building out the sophistication, so that every dollar of advertising investment we spend is well done. The reason we took it out of the expense ratio guidance was because it is more volatile and it has penned down on what kind of growth we're looking to achieve in that quarter. And this is a measure of really how effectively running the business, like how are you keeping your costs down for your customers see can't hit at competitive price. Greg Peters : Thank you for your answers. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of a Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Elyse Greenspan : All right, thanks. Good morning. My first question was on the growth in new business that you guys saw in direct in the quarter. I know from commentary, you guys started to take price during the quarter and then more is on the [Indiscernible], but I was a little bit surprised with the level of growth you saw there, given the increase, the loss trend that you're mentioning. Can you expand upon that? And would you expect a new business growth on the direct side to slow as you push for additional ways through this system? Tom Wilson : Elyse, let me give that to Glenn and just -- but Glenn and his team have done a fabulous job in getting us better at direct. Some of the growth that you see is because of the advertisement we talked about, some of the growth you see is we're just getting a lot better at it. And so once we put the Allstate brand on in Glenn study to combine capabilities. We've just -- we're getting much more effective at what we've closed on, and what we've closed in the cost. Glenn when you want to talk about the prospects for address? Glenn Shapiro : Yeah. I agree there any Tom just said I think we've got really nice prospect because I would say we're making up ground in dog years because we have what we're 20 years newer at doing directed the Allstate brands and some of our competitors. But we're making up chunks of that capability as we move a year-and-a-half into the launching with Allstate brand in direct. The effectiveness of our sales, whether it be our call centers, or on the web, etc., our marketing sophistication, our partners with marketing, all of those things getting better and that helps move it up. The other thing is, actually in this price environment that's going to be disrupted, we're really likely to see some tailwind in new business, but some headwind in retention. Because if we were in a situation where we're the only ones taking rate, you might expect the opposite. But with a whole bunch of people having to take rate that will create a lot of shoppers, we'll create shoppers of our own too, because it disrupts our own customers. And when people shop, they often find a better price for situation. Even in a rising environment like this. So there will be a lot of customers shopping, ours, and other companies. And so, it's an opportunity as Tom said, to leverage what we did and say we're really happy we did transformative growth when we did because we have more ways for customers to buy when that disruptive market happens. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my second question on, just in terms of rate, I believe the majority of your auto policies is six months, so correct me if I'm wrong there, but as we think about the rate going to this system, what you've done in the third quarter, the fourth quarter, and expectations for next year. How long would you -- do you think it will take to get back to your target margins, is it kind of a 6 month to 12 months situation? I know you don't have a specific target margins for Property-liability. We've gone to an overall awry, but we think about putting your margins at an acceptable level that we think that that would come over the next 6 to 12 months or can you give us the time range there? Tom Wilson : I don't think you can do a time range on it, because I don't think we can predict what's going to happen in the future on the inflationary pressures. What we can do is say, we're going to go at this aggressively as soon as we can get there. That will be -- we're going to hustle as Glenn to get it. Well, as he said, his priority is auto insurance margins on that part of the business. We got lots of other priorities to look at. But when you look at inflation, I'm not in the camp that the inflationary, like used car prices are suddenly going to go back down. I think you buy a car for $14,000 and use a cost of $10,000, Like, you're not thinking it's worth $10,000 no matter what the Fed and everybody else thinks about it being transitory. I think the same thing is true with when you look at parts prices. Parts prices, it's not like the oil market where prices are -- the system is built to go up and down everyday, it gets embedded in there. The dealers buy inventories, people, distributors buy inventory, they price that. So we don't really see that being transitory and coming down. How long it will take to work all the way through the system, what opportunities the OEs will take to push prices farther up Is really unknown at this part. So it's hard to determine when they will cross, what you do know is at least in it's half-life, just going to keep going up. As long as we see movement in the bottom line. And it will keep going up until the bottom-line plans out, that being the bottom line is being lost cost. And that top-line then will keep going past their point in time until we get back to the margins. But when we get back to the same underwriting margin on a dollar basis, or a percentage basis on auto insurance. You can't really predict until you can have a better handle on where frequency [Indiscernible]. Glenn, anything you would add to that? Glenn Shapiro : I know that the only thing I would add would be that the tactical answer on the rates, because completely agree. We don't know what the bottom line will do exactly, so we'll have to keep moving those and adjust. But the tactical answer on the rates, you're correct, Elyse, its 6 months in almost all of our states and all of our policy. So it's about 6 months from the effective date to get all customers paying that. And then another 6 months from the point they start paying it to where the full premium has been earnings for one policy period. So you really start to see the effect of the rates starting at the beginning of the year, but more impactfully in the second and third quarters of next year. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Michael Phillips : Thanks, good morning, everybody. I think Glenn answered this question, but just want to be sure. I'm going to ask First Quarter, Second Quarter you were taking some targeted rate costs and now you're not. And I think Glenn said rate increases that are going to continue are going to be I think you said just about everywhere. I Just want to confirm that because I guess the question would be, how much of an overlap would there be in states where you took previous rate cuts -- pretty recent rate cuts, and now moving upward in those same states, is there overlap there in those states? I'm asking because of what that means to consumer impact on maybe retentions, seeing gyrations down and back up again. And then also if there is overlap there, what it means for, just something that Tom said, make sure we have pricing rates to confidence around our current rates. Tom Wilson : Glenn do you want to take that? Glenn Shapiro : Sure. So the short answer to your question would be yes, there will be increases in places where there were modest decreases. I do think we waited a little while to really see what was happening with the frequency and ensure that it was long-standing and has remained a long-standing benefit before taking them. And we were modest and we've done some pretty significant givebacks into shelter in place, get it back, which were one-time and not sort of durable discount. Actually changing rates and moving them down, we were more subtle with and more modest with. I don't think people will see a wild swing down and backup, but they will see it in same-state. And the simple fact is, as you saw on the chart, I believe just on page -- bottom page 7, that used car prices spiked dramatically in the second quarter. And those spike, and then people start having claims. And then those claims start to be paid, working their way into the loss costs, and you have this hyper inflationary environment on auto physical damage lines. So it's just the appropriate response at the appropriate time for it. And we'll do everything we can to maintain our retention. It's one of the wonderful things -- one of the many wonderful things about our agency force. Our agency force do a really good job of building relationships and talking customers through changes in their policies, and helping us through things like this. Michael Phillips : Okay. Thank you very much for that. The second question, a different one on Arity. I guess I'm curious how you think about Arity. Do you think of it as either a more of a use it for our own pricing and telematics business, or that plus [Indiscernible] it off to others and having more of a income-generating machine? It's still not giving you a lot of lift on that second piece, but do you think of it more that way longer-term? And we've seen more and more Companies go the route. You are about the only one that isn't. the go the route of farming that business off, Hartford just announced that recently were they farmed it off, and more and more companies are doing that. So how do you think about Arity? Is it more just for your own pricing or do you want to have it be more of a, again, an income generating machine as well? Tom Wilson : Michael, thank you for asking about something other than auto insurance margins, because we have a lot of good things going on, one of which is Arity, which a significant value has been created with Arity, both in the insurance business and outside the insurance business. And I don't think that's been reviewed by any analysts as if it was a separate Company. I mean, we have 600 billion miles of data. We risk scoring the operation. We help people do marketing, more effectively and efficiently. And so we're really building quite a platform that will do a number of things. One is it does exactly what you've talked about, which is -- and the way we started, it was telematics as a service for us. We needed somebody to collect the data. We needed to get a mobile app up. We needed to put it in files and be able to do something with it. And so rather than do that inside the insurance Company, we decided to do it outside the insurance Company because we said this is -- at the point, we said this is Basically a service at other insurance companies will need and we can provide to them and we do. So. Arity provides that service to some other insurance companies, and we're working to try to expand that effort for them. But it moved beyond what I would just call telematics as a service, help me pull data in to figure out all my customers are doing too. We started collecting more data from ourselves and built a rating service organization so that we can help other insurance companies use telematics to price the insurance. We believe that they're going to get their capability anyway. So we think that we might as well do it through Arity, and capture addition -- additional margin, rather than just assumed that we can take over a 100% of the insurance industry. But being a leader in telematics, which we are, but we don't think we can get the entire market share. So we created a rating services organization around that. It's then been expanded to include really lead generation. As we started collecting more data. So we have data from the Allstate customers, we have data because we have our SDK embedded in other people's thoughts. We have had data and I think it's over 25 million cars were pulling every day, really high fidelity data that's in the same format. We also buy data that we're able to combine with that 25 million on an over another 75 million current. So we're pulling data on a 100 million cars per day right now. And so we're building this rating services organization for all state and other insurers so that we can not only do telematics to the servers. We can do that. We think we can actually work to help people pre -qualify buyers and it's called the Arity IQ. So significant value has been created. I don't think that shows up in shareholder value today because I don't really see any of the analysts really looking hard and saying what's it worth, but we think it's substantial value and we expect to continue to grow their business and expand its total addressable market. Michael Phillips : Okay Tom. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Your question, please. David Motemaden : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I had a question on, I think it was Slide 7, where you show the around a 7% rate increase that you are asking for. I guess that feels high to me, especially considering that the loss ratio, if I take out the reserve charge, was only about 1.5 points higher than the third quarter of 2019. And then also, considering the expense initiatives that you guys have taken to-date, I guess my thought was -- I thought that the expense plan would maybe help reduce the amount of rate that you guys would need to take. I guess -- is that the right way of thinking about it or is it too uncertain at this time and you guys just want to get in front of what might be coming down the road in terms of future loss cost increases? Tom Wilson : Well, it's an accurate call-out, David, that the future expense reductions will certainly help us manage profitability. But we're increasing the price is now because we do want to grow profitably. But being unclear as to where this inflation will sort out, we're being what we think is fair and appropriate, as opposed to overlay aggressive in increasing prices now. As to the extent in the future, we don't need that as much in our expenses come down. Then we can improve our competitive position, which we've been -- we've improved our competitive position pretty significantly in 2021. and we don't want to give that up. And we'd like to continue to improve it as so we get that flywheel of growth going. But in this case, we're using the expense reductions for future competitive price improvement as opposed to saying, we don't need to raise prices because loss costs are [Indiscernible] Glenn or Mario anything you would add to that? Glenn Shapiro : The only thing I'd add is, it is -- it is pretty easy to get negative rates in approved and in market very quickly. And as we talked about in one of the prior answers, it takes time for them to earn in. So we're projecting future loss costs out over the course of the next year and years and taking rate that we think best reflects our best estimates of what we're going to need to deliver the right returns. So it would be a good situation to get into to where we were we slightly overshot and could dial it back. But as Tom said, there's a lot of questions still on where this severity will -- Inflation for severity will end. Tom Wilson : At some point, Glenn. Look, we need to make money in auto insurance, David, and we're going to do that. I think we're out of time, so let me just say as we move forward, you should expect us, as you've heard throughout this call, to focus on improving returns in auto insurance. At the same time, we're not letting up on any of the components of increasing our market share and personal property-liability, or expanding circle of protection. All of which we've had really good progress and success on this year and in this quarter, so you should expect us to continue to focus on a broad-based approach to increasing shareholder value. So thank you for your engagement with us again, and we will talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation at today's conference.

Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted related materials on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2020 and other public documents for information on potential risks. Before I hand it off to Tom, I would like to turn to Slide 2 and discuss the expansion of Allstate's Investor Communications. Beginning this year, instead of a traditional Investor Day, we will be conducting a series of 60 minute investor calls to provide deeper insights into significant strategic or operational topics. These calls will be in addition to our quarterly earnings calls. Our first call will focus on the current auto insurance operating environment and will be scheduled to take place in March. Topics on future calls may include homeowners insurance, independent agent channel strategy, expansion of protection services and investments. In addition to investor calls, we will also begin disclosing the company's auto insurance implemented rate actions from the prior month on our Investor Relations website to provide additional information on premium growth. Rate disclosures will be posted on the third Thursday of every month, like our monthly catastrophe loss disclosures, though the rate postings will occur regardless of whether there is a catastrophe loss release in the month. I look forward to the additional engagement these changes will bring. And now I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let's start on Slide 3. As you know, Allstate refocus on execution and innovation as ways to create shareholder value. And our strategy has two components : increase personal property-liability market share and then expand protection solutions, which are shown on the two ovals on the left. If you start with the upper oval, we've been a leader in product innovation a multichannel distribution and leveraging technology in telematics and claims settlement. So we're now building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution through transformative growth. We're also diversifying our businesses by expanding protection options as shown in the bottom oval. We offer customers a wide range of protection, good workplace benefits, commercial insurance, roadside services, car warranties, protection plans and identity protection. Avail is a leading innovator in telematics and Avail \u2013 sorry, Arity is leading entity in telematics, and Avail is a start-up, which is basically an Airbnb model for Parisien. We leverage the Allstate brand, customer base and capabilities to drive growth in those businesses as well. On the right panel, you can see our five annual operating priorities, which focus on both near-term performance and long-term value currency. So let's move to Slide 4 and go through those operating priorities for the fourth quarter and the full year. Our revenues of $13 billion in the quarter increased 18.7% compared to the prior year quarter, resulting in over $50 billion of revenue for the full year 2021, then reflected by a 1 percentage point increase in auto insurance market share through the National General acquisition, growth in homeowners premiums and then we also had strong growth at Allstate Protection Plans and higher investment income. Property-Liability premiums increased 17%. Net investment income of $847 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased to $187 million compared to 2020, which reflects really strong results from the performance-based portfolio. Net income was $790 million in the quarter compared to $2.6 billion in the prior year as lower underwriting income and a loss related to the sale of the life and annuities business was only partially offset by the higher investment income. Adjusted net income, remember that our measure takes out some of the things that we think are not related to the current economics, was $796 million or $2.75 per diluted share, a decline compared to the $1.6 billion generated in the prior year quarter reflecting lower underwriting income. You'll remember that 2020 had low auto accident frequency, reflecting the impact of the pandemic. 2021 was a year of \u2013 really a two distinct halves as it related to profitability of auto insurance. In the first half of 2021, auto insurance underwriting income benefited as lower accident frequency, offset increased claims severity. As a result, underwriting income for auto insurance totaled over $1.7 billion in the first two quarters. In the second half of the year, auto claim frequency continued to increase towards pre-pandemic levels and the cost of repairing cars and settling bodily injury claims accelerated. We began increasing auto insurance rates in the third quarter and this accelerated in the fourth quarter. These rate increases, however, are earned as policies renew so that the cost increase has resulted in an underwriting loss of slightly over $450 million in the last two quarters. The underlying combined ratio for auto insurance was 92.5 for the full year and 100.2 for the fourth quarter of 2021. And while that generates good underwriting income for the year and a good economic return, the results of the last two quarters are not acceptable, so we're highly focused on raising returns in the auto insurance, as Glenn will discuss in a few minutes. Adjusted net income of $4 billion for the full year was $13.48 per share, which generated a return on common shareholders' equity of 16.9%. Let's go to Slide 5 to go through the operating priority results in more detail. To better serve customers, we lowered expenses to improve the competitive price position of auto insurance. The enterprise Net Promoter Score finished slightly below the prior year, but in part, that reflects the absence of the beneficial impact in 2020 of the pandemic-related customer accommodations. You'll remember, it included $1 billion of shelter-in-place program payments, expanded coverage of longer payment term. This year, we expanded protection offerings in group and health individual products with the acquisition of National General. We significantly grew our customer base in 2021, with total policies in force increasing 9.8% to $190.9 million. Property-Liability policies of course, increased by 13.7% as due to the acquisition of National General, expansion of our direct distribution in the Allstate brand and increased insurance provided through Allstate agents. Protection Services policies also continued to grow, increasing 8.9% to $148.4 million. On the third priority, achieve target returns on capital that was accomplished. We completed the year with adjusted net income of $4 billion and a return on shareholders' equity of 16.9%. Despite the rising loss costs environment, the property-liability combined ratio finished 2021 at 95.9. Protection Services continues to grow profitably, it's really driven by Allstate Protection Plans. And then net investment income was $3.3 billion in 2021 reflecting proactive portfolio management and exceptional performance-based income, as Mario will take you through later as well. The total return on our portfolio was 4.4%, so sustainable value creation refers not only strong execution on the first four items, but long-term growth platform. In 2021, we sold life and annuities business for $4.4 billion. We acquired National General for $4 billion to capture expense savings, leveraging independent agent technology platform and improve our strategic position in this distribution channel. Significant progress was made on transformative growth to build a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution. Allstate Protection Plans continued its rapid growth with written premiums of $1.8 billion that's 5x greater than when the company was acquired five years ago. Arity, our telematics company continues to expand its services and launch highly innovative products. Execution and innovation lead to sustainable value creation. Now let me turn it over to Glenn to discuss property liability results in more detail. Glenn Shapiro : Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Let's start by reviewing property-liability profitability in the fourth quarter on Slide 6. The recorded combined ratio of 98.9 increased 14.9 points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher underwriting losses as well as prior year reserve strengthening. The chart on the bottom left takes you through the impact of each component compared to the prior year quarter. Auto insurance underwriting loss ratio drove most of the increase driven by the impact of rising inflation on auto severity and higher auto accident frequency compared to the prior year. Prior year reserve were strengthening of $182 million had a 1.8 point impact on the combined ratio in the quarter, primarily due to adverse loss development in auto insurance casualty coverage. There was also a sizable impact relative to the premium in shared economy business, which was primarily driven in states we no longer insure with transportation network carriers. This was partially offset by lower underwriting expense ratio, mostly due to lower advertising expenses in the quarter. We continue to focus on cost reductions, which improve our operational flexibility and competitive position. The chart on the lower right shows Allstate's adjusted expense ratio over the last few years. And the adjusted expense ratio as a measure we're using to track our progress on improving value for customers through cost reductions. The measure starts with our underwriting expense ratio, excludes restructuring, coronavirus-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchase intangibles and investment in advertising. It then adds our claim expense ratio, excluding catastrophe claims costs. The adjusted expense ratio improved to 26 in the full year 2021, which is 0.6 point better than prior year and 3.2 lower than 2018. Our long-term objective is a further reduction of 3 points over the next three years, which would represent a 6 point reduction over the six years following 2018, allowing us to improve competitive price position while maintaining attractive returns. Slide 7 provides further insight into the drivers of rising auto insurance loss costs. Allstate Protection auto insurance underlying combined ratio was 100.2 in the fourth quarter and 92.5 through the full year 2021, representing increases of 15.3 and 7.4 points, respectively. The increases reflect higher loss costs due to severity and accident frequency, partially offset by lower expenses. While claim frequency increased relative to prior year, reflecting a return to more normal driving environment, we continue to see favorability compared to pre-pandemic levels. Allstate brand auto property damage frequency was up 21.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 2020, but it was down 13.3% compared to 2019. While we've seen miles driven approach pre-pandemic levels, we've seen a meaningful change in time of day driving, which continues to impact both frequency and severity. Increases in auto severity reflect inflationary pressure across coverages with a number of underlying components of severity rising faster than core inflation. Chart on the lower left shows used car values began increasing in late 2020 and accelerated in mid-2021 in a total increase of 68% beginning in 2019. OEM parts and labor rates have also accelerated in 2021, resulting in higher severities and coverages like collision and property damage. The impact of inflation is also influencing our casualty coverage. During 2020, at the onset of the pandemic, when there was less road congestion and higher speeds, a higher proportion of accidents were more severe. That resulted in more severe injuries per claim and higher average casualty severity. And as 2021 developed, casualty costs continue to rise with more severe injuries, medical inflation and higher medical consumption and higher attorney representation rates. The chart on the lower right breaks down auto report year losses, excluding catastrophe over the past two years. The impact of frequency was favorable in 2020 compared to 2019 with the pandemic. And as you shift into 2021, that favorability is partially reversed, creating a negative year-over-year frequency impact, but still favorable over two years. The impact from higher severities on the other hand were compounded over the two year period and put pressure on both physical damage and casualty coverages. The combination of these factors led to the auto insurance margin pressure that we've seen in the second half of 2021. So let's move to Slide 8 and go deeper into the steps we're taking to improve auto profitability. Allstate has, as you all know, have generated strong auto insurance margins over a long period of time. This is a core capability of ours and we are taking a comprehensive and prescriptive approach to respond to the inflationary pressure and return to our auto margin targets in the mid-90s combined ratio. There are three areas of focus : reducing expenses, which we've talked about, raising rates and managing loss costs through claim effectiveness. Since we already talked about the expenses, I'll start with the rates. And the chart on the lower left, it provides a view into 2021 rate actions. We implemented rate decreases in early 2021 to reflect, in part, Allstate's lower expense ratio and the reduced frequency we were experiencing from the pandemic. But as the year progressed and inflation escalated, we responded with rate increases that began in the third quarter and continued into the fourth quarter. As those continued, you see in the fourth quarter, we took rate in 25 locations at an average increase of 7.1% and a weighted Allstate brand auto premium impact of 2.9%. We'll continue to take rate increases to restore auto profitability at targeted levels, and we'll keep you posted monthly, as Mark mentioned earlier, so that you know where we are on the rates. The chart on the right shows the estimated annual impact of the premium from the implemented rate in each quarter. To relate these two views together that large 2.9% increase implemented in the fourth quarter that you see on the left table, relates directly to the rightmost bar of $702 million in estimated annual written premium. While the rate will obviously help our margin, it takes a little time to be realized, as Tom mentioned, there's an inherent lag between when rates are implemented and when they're reflected in written premium and then ultimately in earned premium. As auto insurance policies generally have a six month term, it takes that time for all of the policies to have renewed at the new rate. And then the annualized written premium impact is fully reflected after 10 months \u2013 after 12 months. As we take more price increases in 2022, the incremental rate will be combined and drive higher levels of written premium first and then average earned premium second as the year progresses and we favorably impact auto margins. Beyond expense reductions and rate increases, we're also leveraging advanced claim capabilities to mitigate loss cost pressure for our customers. We're broadening strategic partnerships with part suppliers and repair facilities to mitigate repair costs. We're using advanced claim analytics and predictive modeling tools to optimize repair versus total loss decisions and to assess the likelihood for injury and attorney representation on casualty claims. The bottom line is we are highly confident in our ability to restore auto profitability to targeted levels. And while auto results tend to dominate discussions around the personal lines industry, it's really important to recognize that broad product suite we offer, as Tom mentioned earlier, and in particular, our homeowners insurance product. So moving to Slide 9, I want to spend a few minutes on our industry-leading homeowners business. A majority of our customers bundle home and auto insurance, which improves retention and overall economics of both lines. And simply put, we have a differentiated homeowners ecosystem including product, underwriting, reinsurance, claims capabilities that are unique in the industry. As a proof point to that, since 2017, we've earned $3.3 billion or an average of $667 million a year in underwriting income, while the industry has generated close to an $18 billion underwriting loss from 2017 to 2020. The graph at the bottom left shows homeowners insurance combined ratios for Allstate select competitors and the industry overall since 2011 and you can see there that Allstate's consistently outperformed. We're well positioned to maintain our margins in homeowners and to continue growing it. Our House & Home product is designed to address severe weather risks and has sophisticated pricing features and inflation factors that respond to changes in replacement values, which is particularly important during an inflationary environment like the one we're in. The chart on the lower right shows Allstate homeowners net written premium over time as well as policies in force. We've grown policies in force steadily, increasing to 1.5% up at year-end, and our Allstate agents are in a great position to continue to broaden customer relationships with homeowners products. Net written premium has really taken off through 2021 reaching 13.8% variance by the fourth quarter. Now the increasing spread between those two lines, the net written premium and the policies in force, is due to an increased average in premium per policy, which has steadily grown through 2021. That is mostly due to the premium rising with the increases we saw in replacement costs and to a lesser extent rate increases. That view that difference that I just illustrated really helps show how our product reacts quickly to inflationary forces and allows us to better match price and risk. On the claims side, we've made investments in technology with photo, video and aerial imagery for timely and accurate loss cost management. Shifting to National General's homeowners book. It provides us an awesome opportunity to grow in the independent agent channel, and we're really optimistic about the ability to bundle there with independent agents when we're deploying new middle-market products on the National General ecosystem. But in the near-term, we're focused on improving their profitability in homeowners by leveraging Allstate's expertise in data, pricing sophistication and underwriting capabilities. Our ultimate goal is to meet customers' protection needs while optimizing shareholder risk and return. We underwrite risk directly in homeowners where we can achieve targeted returns. We also broker other insurers property policies where we can meet protection needs for customers, but we can't achieve the adequate returns that we require, and this allows us to maintain an auto relationship with them. We also shift a lot of our catastrophe risk to reinsurance markets, including traditional reinsurance and alternative capital covering both individual large events and an annual aggregate cover. All in, as I said at the start of this, we have a differentiated homeowners insurance capability in the market, and it operates as a really strong diversifying book of business while we improve auto margins. So with that, let me turn it over to Mario to cover the remainder of our results before we move to questions. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Glenn. Let's move to Slide 10 and discuss how transformative growth positions us for long-term success. So as we've discussed on past calls, transformative growth is a multiyear initiative to increase personal property-liability market share by building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution. This will be accomplished by delivering on four- key objectives : improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing both the sophistication and investment in customer acquisition and deploying a new technology ecosystem. We made significant progress across each objective in 2021. Our commitment to further lower our costs, improves customer value and enables a more competitive price position while maintaining attractive returns. By leveraging our industry-leading telematics offering as well as advanced data and analytics, we are able to redesign products to create competitively differentiated offerings for our customers. We have transformed our Allstate agent model to increase growth and decrease distribution costs. We've improved the strength of our direct channel through lower pricing and enhanced capabilities, and the acquisition of National General further improved our strategic position in the independent agent channel. Customer acquisition costs relative to lifetime value have improved with higher close rates and increased use of analytics to improve marketing effectiveness. As a result, we invested more in marketing in 2021. We also made progress on deploying the technology necessary to achieve transformative growth. New customer and product management ecosystems will improve ease of use and self-service capabilities at lower costs. We are using both purchased and proprietary software, which is currently in dark deployment before it is operationally tested this year. Delivering on each objective in an integrated way enables us to increase market share and create additional shareholder value. Turning to Slide 11. Let's look how transformative growth has already begun to successfully drive results in our Property-Liability business. In the chart on the left, you will see Property-Liability policies in force grew by 13.7% compared to the prior year quarter, driven predominantly by the National General acquisition. National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of 4.2 million policies and Allstate brand Property-Liability policies increased 374,000, reflecting enhanced direct channel capabilities and growth in homeowners sold through Allstate agents. Property-Liability policies in force also grew organically by 1.5% from 37.5 million to 38.3 million in 2021, driven by contributions from growth in both the Allstate and National General brands, reflecting enhanced direct and independent agent capabilities. The chart on the right shows a breakdown of new issued applications for personal auto, which grew 61% compared to the prior year. The middle section of the chart shows Allstate brand impacts by channel, which grew 4.3% compared to the prior year. Existing exclusive agents increased new business compared to the prior year, but that increase was offset by fewer appointments of new agents. As you know, we significantly reduced the number of new Allstate agents being appointed beginning in early 2020 as we've been developing and deploying a new agent model to drive higher growth at a lower cost. The direct channel now represents 30% of new auto policies and grew by 28% compared to the prior year. This more than offset a slight decline from existing agents and volume that would historically have been generated by newly appointed agents. On the far right of the chart, you can see the significant impact of National General, which added 2 million applications in 2021. Slide 12 shows how Protection Services continues to generate profitable growth. Revenues, which exclude the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, increased 21.9% to $606 million in the quarter and increased 23.5% to $2.3 billion for the full-year 2021. The increase in revenues was driven by continued growth at Allstate Protection Plans and Arity. Allstate Protection Plans grew revenue by 23.8% and written premium by 49.1% for the full year 2021 compared to the prior year, driven by expanded products and partnerships, including the successful launch of the Home Depot relationship earlier in 2021. As written premium is earned over policy periods that can range from one to five years, it will continue to generate future revenue growth as we earn the $2 billion of unearned premium associated with Allstate Protection Plans on our balance sheet as of year-end. Arity expanded revenues by integrating lead cloud and transparently into its customer offerings, which were acquired as part of the National General acquisition as well as increased device revenue, driven by growth in the Milewise product. Policies in force increased 8.9% to 148 million, primarily due to growth at Allstate Protection Plans. Adjusted net income of $179 million for the full year 2021 represented an increase of $26 million compared to the prior year, driven by growth at Allstate Protection Plans. We will continue to invest in growing these businesses as they provide an attractive opportunity to both meet customer needs and create economic value for our shareholders. Let's move to Slide 13 and talk about the Allstate Health and Benefits segment, which generated growth and increased profit reflecting the National General acquisition. We've been offering voluntary benefits through the employer channel for over 20 years, and the acquisition of National General added both group and individual health products to our portfolio. These additions drove a significant increase in revenue with premiums and contract charges increasing 66.5% to the prior year. It also brought in a stream of $359 million of additional revenue, shown as other revenue on this slide, primarily from administrative fees and commissions from sales of nonproprietary health products. Adjusted net income more than doubled to $208 million in 2021 and as higher income from the National General acquisition was partially offset by a higher benefit ratio, reflecting higher life mortality in 2021 and lower benefit utilization in the prior year. Now let's move to Slide 14, which highlights our investment performance. Net investment income totaled $847 million in the quarter, which was $187 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance-based income as shown in the chart on the left. Performance-based income totaled $516 million in the quarter, as shown in gray, reflecting private equity appreciation and direct asset sales. As in prior quarters, we experienced broad-based private equity valuation increases. Several large idiosyncratic contributions \u2013 contributors meaningfully impacted results in the quarter with about 50% of performance-based investment income generated by 10 individual investments. Market-based income, shown in blue, was $7 million below the prior year quarter. The impact of reinvestment rates below the average interest-bearing yield was largely mitigated in the quarter by higher average assets under management and prepayment fee income. During 2021, the portfolio also generated more than $1 billion in net gains on investments and derivative instruments, including $428 million from valuation of market-based equity investments and $167 million of net gains from the performance-based portfolio, primarily from gains on sales of direct real estate investments. Our total portfolio return was 1.1% in the fourth quarter and 4.4% year-to-date, reflecting income and higher equity valuations, partially offset by higher interest rates. On the right, we've provided our annualized portfolio return in total and by strategy over various time horizons. Our total portfolio returns have been strong across these time periods with contributions from both our market-based and performance-based portfolios. The market-based portfolio delivers predictable earnings to support business needs with returns highly influenced by public markets. The performance-based portfolio is deployed against capital and longer liabilities and supplements market risk with idiosyncratic risk. Equity investments have higher long-term returns, which compensate investors for higher volatility, and we have sufficient capital to hold these assets through the full investment cycle. Our performance-based portfolio has experienced returns above our historical trend over the last several quarters. While prospective returns will depend on future economic and market conditions, we do expect these returns to moderate from last year's level. Now let's go to Slide 15 to discuss our proactive portfolio management. Our investment portfolio is a key contributor to shareholder value and is highly integrated into our overall enterprise risk and return processes. The divestiture of the life and annuity businesses reduced our portfolio from $94 billion at year-end 2020 to $65 billion today and provided us an opportunity to shift our asset allocation to increase risk-adjusted returns. Since most of these \u2013 of the assets backing our life and annuity business were fixed income securities, the divestiture lowered overall enterprise interest rate and credit risk. As a result, we increased our allocation to higher returning equity investments while maintaining the total amount of capital backing investment risks. As you can see from the bottom left, higher return public equity and performance-based investments now account for 23% of the overall portfolio. These investments do have more volatility than fixed income securities, so we allocate more capital to support them, but the higher return more than offset \u2013 more than offsets the risk of increased volatility, creating additional shareholder value. Over three-fourth of the portfolio is still fixed income securities, which generates consistent cash flow. The result is a higher returning portfolio with lower interest rate risk overall. We actively manage interest rate risk and consider how it impacts overall enterprise risk and return. As you can see in the blue bars on the right chart, we extended duration from 2018 to 2020 when interest rates shown in the orange line were declining. This mitigated the impact of lower interest rates on auto insurance prices and was a balanced risk and return position from an enterprise perspective. In 2021, we concluded that interest rates were not sufficiently compensating us for the risk that interest rates would rise, which would have a negative impact on the valuation of our bond portfolio. As you know, the consumer price index increased throughout 2021, shown by the light blue line on the chart, and we've discussed at length the impact that inflation has had on auto insurance margins. As a result, we shortened the duration of the fixed income portfolio through the sale of long corporate and municipal bonds and to a lesser extent, the use of derivatives. We are taking additional actions in 2022 to further reduce the negative impact higher interest rates would have on fixed income valuation. This will lower fixed income portfolio yield and investment income for the near term, but positions the portfolio to reinvest into higher rates if they continue to rise. Finally, let's move to Slide 16, which highlights Allstate's strong capital position. Allstate's capital position remains strong and enables significant cash returns to shareholders while investing in growth. We returned $4.1 billion through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends in 2021. The common dividend was increased 50% compared to 2020, and common shares outstanding were reduced by 7.8% over the last 12 months. So if you held a share of stock at the beginning of 2020, you now own 7.8% more of the enterprise. As of year-end 2021, we had $3.3 billion remaining on the current $5 billion share repurchase program, which is expected to be completed by March 31, 2023. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joshua Shanker with Bank of America. Your line is open. Joshua Shanker : Yeah, thank you. My first question, in the prepared statements in the press release, you mentioned the idea of rationalizing expenses in order to get back to profitability. You also have a goal of reducing your expense ratio by 300 basis points through transforming growth over the next three-years. Are you accelerating the process? Are you going to be taking some costs out that will return in 2023, but be offset by some more restructuring? How do the different parts of that play together? Hello? Hello? Glenn Shapiro : Hello. Tom, did you want to start? Joshua Shanker : Maybe we lost Tom. Glenn Shapiro : Mario, you should start. Mario Rizzo : Okay. All right. Tom Wilson : It sounds like \u2013 Josh, can you hear me? Joshua Shanker : Yes, yes. Go ahead. Tom Wilson : Okay Great. It only took me five tries with hash six or star six. First, I don't think you should think about \u2013 there are obviously things you do in the short term like we reduced advertising a little bit in the fourth quarter because we don't want to go get a bunch of customers and then end up with a large price increase in the next six months. So you manage that. But in general, when you look at our expense reduction program, it's well laid out. I think it's another three years. It includes everything from using digital processes and getting rid of extra labor to using more outsourcing and cleaning up our processes and reducing our technology costs with the new platform. So those things will roll out. You can't really accelerate those because it has impact on customers. So we're not doing anything for 2022 to just get to our number that then you're going to turn around and look at 2023 and say, jeez, I thought you were profitable and now you're not. So we take a longer-term view of that. That's a little different in pricing and that we will be more aggressive early on in pricing and try to get ahead of the curve as opposed to trying to smooth that out over a multiyear period. Mario or Glenn, anything you would add to that? Mario Rizzo : Yes, Josh, this is Mario. Thanks for the question. I would agree with Tom, I think what we're focused on is permanent cost reductions that will on a sustained basis improve our competitive position and improve customer value and really enable profitable growth. And we're going to continue to focus on things like operating costs and distribution costs that we can permanently take out of the system. And as Tom mentioned, leveraging tools like automation, process redesign off-shoring where we can and really kind of implement plans that do take time and aren't the kinds of things that I think you can accelerate the execution of. But we're also not focused on ripping a bunch of costs out, that's just going to come back into the system. We want to make the cost reductions permanent, achieve the three points over time because that will really position us to grow and grow at really attractive returns going forward. Joshua Shanker : So the expense ratio was a little high obviously in the quarter, and I'm actually referring to in the press release where you said that you're going to drive down expenses it seemed like it was more reactive to what's going on right now, there's a short-term benefit. At least I'm trying to find the wording in the press release. In response, Allstate is reducing expenses and claims loss management, reducing expenses here in response. I mean, obviously, you have the transformative growth plan, but is there an initiative on top of that to reduce expenses to get you to a healthy underwriting profit in the near-term associated with the spike in losses? Tom Wilson : Josh, I don't \u2013 we did not mean for it to have that interpretation. When you look at improving profitability in auto insurance, number one thing will be increased our rates. As the lowering expenses, as part of Mario said, the growth objective or transformed growth plan, that will obviously help, but we would have done that anyway. In fact, we started at like two or three years ago, and we're really glad we did it because we came into this year with, as Glenn pointed out, about 3 points lower than we would have been had we not started. But that's ongoing piece, but it's a component of improving profitability, but it's just not \u2013 not like we started in claim loss cost management is somewhere in between the two, you're always using data analytics and new claim processes, new relationships with vendors to try to reduce your cost. But as the cost change in the locus of those cost changes. Sometimes you have to adjust the programs you have in place \u2013 so I would say that the primary thing to focus on is rate increases in terms of the near-term improvement in auto profitability. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open. Greg Peters : Good morning, everyone. I would like to turn our attention to Slide 8 of your investor presentation and where you roll through the details about the rate increases that you're \u2013 that you've achieved and your expectations going forward. I guess just in the chart that's in the bottom left, just a further clarification on that. It's this number of locations, 25. Is locations the same thing as states? Or are we dealing with 100 locations? And then when we see an Allstate brand increase of 2.9%, is that a quarterly increase that we can annualize? And I guess where this is going is just trying to figure out the rate you're getting versus where the loss cost trend is and if you're catching up exceeding it or still behind? Tom Wilson : Greg, I understand the need and desire to get to the math, and that's why we've added the monthly disclosure. Glenn, do you want to take the specifics on the slide? Glenn Shapiro : Sure. So directly answering the question, the 2.9% is an annualized and the 25 states. So this truly is like if we stopped, if all we did was the fourth quarter, we got 2.9% rate increase across our book of business. We're not stopping in the fourth quarter, and we did a little bit in the third quarter, we took about $800 million in rate increases between the two quarters and we'll continue to. But that amount of money, when you look at the right side, you look at the 81 and the 702 that is the full impact of the rate increase. Tom Wilson : Greg, when we get to the \u2013 when we do the auto call in March, we'll give you a little more specifics on how to calculate that because the 2.9% is based on the \u2013 it's a dollar, right? We have a dollar number of what we think we're going to get. It's 2.9% is 2.9% times the prior year premiums. As the prior year premiums, if you look at the total, of course, when you're raising rates, it keeps going up, too. So the full year number is not the annualized number of December. So we'll help you figure out how to do that in March. Greg Peters : Got it. I appreciate the color. And by the way, the increased disclosure, I think, is appropriate, considering where you guys are, so applaud that change. I guess the other \u2013 the big picture question around the slide and just the market environment. Obviously, the auto market is under a lot of duress right now with inflation issues. And there's been news reports from different states and different regulators about pushback on rate increase filings. And I thought maybe you could give us an update of \u2013 I don't want to go state by state, but some of the big target states, how the regulators are responding to the data that you're showing them, is it a process that's going to take a while? Or do you think they're receptive immediately? Just if you could give us sort of a state of the union on the regulatory front, that would be helpful. Tom Wilson : Glenn, could you handle that? Glenn Shapiro : Sure, will. So Greg, it's a great question. And I know we've been the last couple of quarters. So the conversation has been a lot about will it be pushback? How do we do it? I think the evidence \u2013 this page that you pointed us back to, Page 8, the evidence is pretty clear. 25 states implemented at a 7.1% average increase. We are continuing to go at a very fast pace across other states and even in some cases, the same states, again, with rate increases as we get new data and new trends. And to this point, we have \u2013 you're always going to experience some discussions, some push on the data, some negotiation, if you will, and some back and forth. But we've \u2013 you can see it there, those are implemented rates. And we've been successful. And our people, and I give a ton of credit to our state managers and our product team who've done over years, an incredible job of building relationships because they provide a lot of detail when they do a rate increase or a decrease, any type of rate change we make. And we get great responses because ultimately, these are numbers people talking to numbers people. It is less \u2013 most often anyway, is less a political issue than it is a reality issue of looking at the numbers and what is the justifiable and supportable rate increase. And again, we've been very successful so far. We have no reason to believe we won't continue to be. We'll have pushback in places, and we'll have discussions and give and take. But overall, we're getting the rates that we need, and we're going to continue to do that. Tom Wilson : Greg, it's \u2013 the regulators come out of when they want to treat customers fairly. And as Glenn pointed out, the first thing they want is transparency, and our team spends a tremendous amount of time trying to be transparent with the regulators. It's also about what's your history with them. So we did a shelter and place payback of $1 billion. No regulator asked us or forces to do it. We did it proactively within my 10 days of noticing this guy here and his team got organized on it. So it's not like they do everything we want, but it's about treating customers fairly. And then in addition, when you're going in on the physical damage coverages, it's paid in 90 days. So there's not a great debate over whether the money went out or not. It just does. And then finally, injury, can be a little more discussion around it because there are longer-term trends, but we have good math on that as well. So we're confident we can get our combined ratio into the target level that Glenn talked about, which is in mid-90s. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Paul Newsome : Good morning. Thanks for all the help. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about auto claim severity on sort of an ongoing basis because maybe the Manheim used car prices don't do this incredible increase again. And so I think if there's anything you can do to help us kind of figure out what that trend would be if you pull out some of the real extraordinary things that happened over the last six months. So I think that might help us get to a better kind of ongoing run rate. Tom Wilson : Glenn have some good math on that. Glenn Shapiro : Yes. So as we look at severity, a significant majority on the physical damage lines, which you were pointing to, Paul, is driven by the price of cars. It's \u2013 I think I said this last quarter, but I really like the example of if you were \u2013 if you had a life insurance company and all your policy limits went up by 50% or something, with no premium change, you'd have an issue. And really, the value of the car is the policy limit. That's the capitation method for property damage and collision. So that moving up has driven, call it, 80-ish percent of the overall severity issue. So as I look at that, there are a couple of ways you can look at it going forward, and this is not just Allstate, this is looking at the world around us that we operate in. One is when will supply chain issues and chip shortages be corrected, most of what you see externally is that, that will last through 2022. The other one is, is that there's likely some sort of structural maximum that used car prices go to because they probably won't end up exceeding new cars prices. And as we get to a year-over-year comparison, where in Q2 of 2021 was the largest single quarter of increase where there was that really steep uphill climb, at some point, you're not going to have those same type of increases on a year-over-year basis, but you may stabilize at a higher level for some period of time. And that's what we've factored in to the way we're looking at our incurred losses, and it's in there in terms of the way we've reported our results and our severities and how we're looking at it going forward. Paul Newsome : What about the inflation on that the non \u2013 sort of the nonlimit piece, that 20%? What do you think that's doing today? Glenn Shapiro : Yes. That is \u2013 so when you look at the \u2013 whether it's repair parts costs are accelerating labor like most industries, labor costs going up, that's continuing to move up. But I think an important way to look at it is if you removed the cost of cars, the used car price that limit going up, everything else combined would be in line with sort of our normal trend for severity, that mid-single-digit trend that you'd expect to see. Now then that's completely excluding one major factor, so I understand that it has a little bias to it because car prices do go up a little bit over time. But it is driving the lion's share of it because it's not like you expect severities to be flat year-over-year. They've moved up. Every year over long, long periods of time, there's just normal inflationary movement that happens in there, wherever it's low single digits, some years, mid-single digits or even higher single digits, other years. what is so extreme right now driving the double-digit increases is that change in car prices, but the 20% that I referred to is labor and repair costs, which we're really looking to tackle by increasing our use of direct repair and leveraging our scale in parts purchasing. Paul Newsome : Thank you. Very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Your line is open. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning. First question. Slide 7 shows that auto frequency is still at a $1.4 billion good guy relative to 2019. So my question is, do you expect that frequency to normalize? And if so, is the 7% rate increase that you show on Slide 8, already contemplating that normalized frequency? Tom Wilson : Glenn, do you want to take that? Glenn Shapiro : I will. Yes. So I give a ton of credit to our team that does all our math and our modeling, they've done a really nice job on frequency, and we're sitting just about right on top of where we expected to be a year ago on it. So will it normalize to some degree probably? While we can't predict different things can happen in the world, we can't predict and won't give a forward-looking prediction of frequency, you'd expect there to be some normalization to pre-pandemic levels. But as we've said for a while now that we believe that there is some durable structural change. People aren't going to be commuting to office buildings as frequently as they did before the pandemic. We probably all know many people, including some of ourselves, that don't do that and won't do that even on an ongoing basis. And 40% of our losses occur in rush hour. So the commuting time, Monday to Friday mornings and afternoons, so when you got significantly fewer drivers on 40% of your last time period and that shift in when people drive, it makes changes to both frequency and severity. So we think that there's some durable reduction there that barring all the other things that change around it, would be consistent in the way frequency stays a bit lower. But as I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, we also see some severity increase from that because the driving has shifted to more leisure times to times where the roads are more open, people are driving faster. It creates harder hits with greater severity, that's hitting us both on the physical damage and the casualty side. So there's just a lot of pieces and parts in there. But to summarize with your question, are we contemplating that in our rate plan? The answer is absolutely yes. We are contemplating in the rate plan, our expectations for frequency, our expectations for severity. And we're going hard after rate, as you can see, and we're not done. Yaron Kinar : That\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate that. Maybe shifting to homeowners for a second. Look, I fully recognize that you have a tremendous track record there and certainly have earned your fair share of income there over the years. That said, if I look at the specific quarter, it seems like you saw some year-over-year deterioration, which seems to be a bit of an outlier relative to some of your earlier reporting peers. I'm just curious as to why this book maybe saw a different trend? I know you called out higher inflationary impact, but was there anything specific to the Allstate book? Tom Wilson : Yes. It's hard to compare us to other people. If you're talking about Progressive, I'd say our combined ratio is 15 to 20 points better than theirs on a billions of dollars of either theirs or ours, but I don't even think there's a comparison. But \u2013 so we \u2013 the business bounces around a little bit. We get a good return on capital on it. Was it in the high 90s? Is that where we want it to be on a long-term basis? No. There's a bounce around by year, yes. And so we feel highly confident we can continue to differentiate ourselves in this space in that business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Motemaden : Hi, thanks. Just a question on when you think you'll be able to get to that mid-90s combined ratio in auto? Glenn, I think you've talked about some of the \u2013 I guess, your thinking around some of the moving parts around physical damage or severity. So wondering if you can maybe \u2013 we can zoom out and think your timing when you guys think you guys can get back to that mid-90s targeted combined ratio in personal auto. Tom Wilson : Good question. I understand why it's important because everybody is trying to figure out the turn and when will it be in the P&L so you can get in early. And I understand the same thing is when people are looking at sort of various rate increases. The headline would be, we're not going to give a projection as to when because you can't predict what will happen to frequency, severity, rate increases. What you can do is look on a longer-term basis and say, when you look at auto insurance and you look at the broad competitive set, Allstate Progressive and GEICO tend to outperform the industry and have combined ratios, which generate attractive returns and just \u2013 you can just graph it out over five or 10 years we all sort of hover in the same place. There are other people like some of the large mutuals and stuff which don't operate at that level, but we've proven an ability to get there. So we think that we'll continue to get there as to the speed of it. Sometimes people ask about the speed, is very idiosyncratic. Like, if your frequency moved up to near \u2013 closer to pre-pandemic levels, earlier than ours did, then you should have been taking price earlier and severities, the same thing, people manage their loss costs differently. So we tend to look at it and say, with the long term, we know how to make money in this business on how we're confident we'll get there. But we've not put a date out which we said we'll be in the mid-90s. David Motemaden : Okay. Thanks. That's fair. And then for my second \u2013 or my follow-up question just on I just wanted to focus a little bit on the bodily injury severity and some of the casualty changes, some of the charges you took this quarter. Maybe you could help me understand where that's been running. What specifically happened this quarter that made you realize that charge? And I think the last time you spoke about this. You had said that it was more or less in line with medical cost inflation. I think this was a few years ago. And that was notably below your peers back then. So I guess it's sort of a long way of asking, how are you thinking about the BI severity now given the changes that you've made? And how are you reflecting that in your picks going forward? Tom Wilson : Yes, it's a good question. And the percentage is sometimes get a little confusing because it's a percentage, in other words, it's absolute dollars is the way we reserve to it. Mario, do you want to talk about the reserve changes? Mario Rizzo : Sure, Tom. So I guess the play side start is we have really strong reserving processes, and we're continually looking at our reserve levels, both for the current report year but also for prior years. And we're taking into account things that we're seeing, both in terms of inflationary trends as well as other phenomenon. And we talked a little bit earlier around things like medical inflation, consumption, attorney representation, those all factor in. So I think, David, the thing we saw this quarter was we continued to see upward development in prior years and some of the casualty coverages. And we took that into account this quarter in terms of raising our ultimate report year expectations for bodily injury in a couple of the prior years. But it was really in reaction to the continuation of some of those trends that I talked about that are causing bodily injury and other casualty severities to increase to levels that were beyond kind of the range of outcomes that we had established earlier on for those prior years. So we reacted to it. We tend to be conservative when we set reserves. But in this particular instance, we saw those trends develop out, and we reacted to it and increased the prior year reserves on auto casualty. Tom Wilson : So \u2013 and we do it by state and by coverage. I mean so if we \u2013 there's a fair amount of granularity to it, is market is not always as precise as you like because you're trying to guess what it's going to cost us settle to something. Well, thank you for participating. Let me just close by saying, there's two stories here. The narrower story is, it's about the insurance industry and Allstate dealing with auto insurance of profitability caused by inflation in fixing cars and then also fixing bodies. Great longer longitudinal story is, which I don't want to let it on the cutting of the floor is about a significant repositioning of the company while dealing with that issue. So we sold our life business. We spent $4 billion success with our National General into the fold increase our market share by 1%, which different position in the independent agent channel for transformation of the Allstate branded business is going quite well, whether that's expanding direct lowering costs or building out new products and improving our competitive position. And then our Protection Services business is really reached a substantive multibillion dollar level with large source of future revenue growth to come because of the way the time works. And at the same time, we're continuing to buy back shares and pay great dividends. So thank you all for participating, and we'll talk to the next quarter. Actually, we'll talk to you in March when we come back to auto reels. Operator : This concludes fourth quarter conference call. You can now disconnect.",

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Mark Nogal. Mark Nogal : Thank you, Kirby. Good morning, and welcome to Allstate's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. After prepared remarks, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted today's presentation, along with our reinsurance update on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate operations. Allstate's results could differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2021 and other public documents for information on potential risks.  Before I hand it off to Tom, I want to share that we will be hosting our second special topic investor call on June 16, focusing on the value of homeowners. We look forward to the additional engagement later this quarter, and we'll share further information soon. And now I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas Wilson : Well, good morning, and thank you for investing your time in Allstate today. Now let's start on Slide 2. So Allstate's strategy to deliver Transformative Growth and higher valuation has two components : increase personal profit liability market share and expand protection services, which are shown in the 2 ovals on the left. We're building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution to a Transformative Growth. We're also diversifying our business by expanding protection offerings as shown in the bottom. In the first quarter, we made progress in 3 key areas to execute this strategy. We're 6 months into a multifaceted plan to address the negative impact of inflation, which is largely in auto insurance. This begins with aggressively raising prices. We're doing this surgically and raising prices more for new or shorter tenured customers with less profitability and less for longer tenured profitable customers. Progress was also made in executing programs to reduce expenses and manage loss costs. We also shifted our asset allocations by reducing the interest rate exposure of our bond portfolio in the fourth quarter of last year, which lowered the overall enterprise impact from higher inflation by $800 million.  Secondly, we continue to make progress on transformative growth by expanding customer access increasing pricing sophistication and building new technology ecosystems. Protection Services also continues its profitable growth trajectory with revenue growth of almost 14% above the prior year.  Moving to Slide 3, let's discuss first quarter performance in more detail. Property liability premiums earned increased 6.1% due to higher average premiums and a 2.1% growth in policies in force. Net investment income of $594 million was 16.1% below the prior year quarter, reflecting lower fixed income reinvestment rates, the impact of reducing the bond portfolio duration and strong performance-based portfolio income that was in comparison to an exceptional prior year quarter.  Net income of $630 million in the first quarter compares to a $1.4 billion loss in the prior year, which included losses related to the disposition of the life and annuity businesses. Adjusted net income of $726 million or $2.58 per diluted share declined compared to the nearly $1.9 billion generated in the prior year quarter due to lower underwriting income. You'll remember, last year's first quarter reflected low auto accident frequency because of the pandemic and inflation and loss costs had not yet been realized. We provided over $1 billion in cash returns to shareholders in the quarter and reduced outstanding shares by 8.1% over the last 12 months. Moving to Slide 4. You can see how income from homeowners insurance, investments, Protection Services and health and benefits mitigated the negative impact as inflation had on auto insurance. Insurance underwriting margins provided $267 million of after-tax adjusted net income or $0.95 a share. Auto insurance generated a slight underwriting loss with a recorded combined ratio of B. Our industry-leading homeowners insurance business generated underwriting income that contributed $335 million of adjusted net income or $1.19 per share. And although performance-based investment income declined from record highs in 2021, results were still strong in the first quarter, with property liability net investment income contributing $1.56 per share. Protection Services and Health and Benefits income more than offset the losses in auto insurance.  Now let me turn it over to Glenn to discuss the property liability results in more detail. Glenn Shapiro : Thanks, Tom. Starting on Page 5, we'll talk about profitability in Allstate Brand auto insurance. We target mid-90s combined ratio in auto insurance. And as you could see from the chart on the left, we have a long history of meeting or exceeding that target, supported by our pricing sophistication, underwriting, claims expertise, expense management. And of course, when you look at 2020 in that chart, it's an outlier in terms of the view because we had much better than target results due to the early pandemic impacts. On the chart on the right breaks down the 5 most recent quarters, highlighting the significant increase in combined ratio that occurred in 2021, as we transitioned from those favorable pandemic impacts to the high inflation environment that we're in today. . In late 2020 and early 2021, as Tom just mentioned, while we were running a combined ratio around 80 and benefiting from frequency and the improved cost structure changes we've made, we took price decreases. And then as inflation spiked in Q2 and Q3 of last year, we shifted towards rate increases, which ramped up significantly in the last 6 months. The recorded and underlying combined ratios improved sequentially in the first quarter of '22, though inflationary trends continue to pressure margins with increasing severity. And frequency is obviously higher year-over-year from that low point, but it's been very stable in terms of maintaining lower level frequency compared to pre-pandemic levels. We'll go deeper into severity and pricing for auto insurance in the next few pages. So let's move to Slide 6 and talk about Allstate auto physical damage claims severity in more detail. The story of higher severity has continued into 2022, and it's across the country, as you can see from the map on the left. Allstate Brand report year 2022 incurred severity for property damage increased about 11% compared to report year '21. Now recall that we shifted to report year incurred severity to give you a better view directly into what's recorded in our financials. And it's really important to note on this that when you look at paid severities, it's typically shared as a comparison to the prior year quarter or year-to-date or some prior period, whereas our new disclosure is an estimate of the full change in the fully developed report year severities year-over-year. So the 11% in this case, is the expected severity in '22 over all of 2021, inclusive of the inflation seen in quarters 2 through 4.  On the chart on the right, you can see that Allstate has a higher distribution of total loss claims involving newer vehicles compared to the industry. And while those vehicles come with higher premiums, they also can adversely impact total loss severity when vehicle values rise. We're adjusting pricing and using our strong claim capabilities to mitigate rising costs, and that includes leveraging our scale, our operating processes, experienced claim professionals, technology, broad repair relationships that we have and our investments in data and analytics to help contain costs for customers.  Moving to Slide 7. Let's talk about bodily injury severity increases because they've also contributed to auto insurance cost and price increases. Like property damage, casualty loss trends have been elevated for the past few years and continued into '22. But the bodily injury pressure isn't quite as wide spread. Allstate brand report year '22 incurred severity for bodily injury increased about 8% compared to report year '21. Higher-speed accidents and less congested roads are leading to harder impact crashes and more severe injuries, and an evolving legal environment is also a factor in casualty costs. If you look at the chart on the left, you'll see that claims resulting in a nondrivable vehicle, which would mean kind of a harder hit and claims resulting in bodily injury claims with a major injury designation have increased compared to pre-pandemic levels. That's driving a shift to more complex and costly treatments and contributing to higher medical consumption.  In terms of the legal environment, trial attorney advertising for claimants has doubled over the past decade and exceeds $1 billion annually now. That results in higher attorney representation rates, and ultimately, higher costs for consumers. The chart on the right shows the severity variance to prior years trending higher in some of our more populous states like Texas, Florida, Georgia, New York and California. And Texas actually accounted for about 80% of the prior report year strengthening within bodily injury in the first quarter. Here again, our scale, our investments in technology and in data and analytics and our claim expertise are helping us resolve claims fairly, accurately and efficiently.  Moving to Slide 8, let's talk about another key component to our multifaceted plan to deal with inflation, and that's raising auto insurance prices. The table on the left provides a view into 2021 in the first quarter of '22 rate actions in Allstate Brand Auto. We implemented rate decreases as we talked about earlier, in early '21 to reflect our continued lower frequency and expense reductions. In the second quarter, as inflation picked up, we pulled back on any reductions and began increasing rates by the third quarter, and then those rate actions accelerated in the fourth quarter and then further accelerate in the first quarter this year. In the first quarter of '22, we implemented rate in 28 states with an average increase of 9.3% and a weighted Allstate Brand Auto premium impact of 3.6%. When you combine that with the fourth quarter actions, we've increased weighted rates by 6.5% over the last 6 months, and that equates to a gross annualized written premium impact of $1.6 billion within the Allstate brand.  About 95% of our premiums in the U.S. are coming from 6-month term policies. So the rates will improve margins, but there's a lag between when the rates are implemented and they're ultimately earned, which you can see in the chart on the right, which estimates when the rate increases taken in the last 6 months will be earned into premium. That illustration assumes only 85% of the annualized premium will be earned to account for things like retention and the fact that customers modify their policy terms when faced with a price increase, like changing deductibles or limits.  As you can see, looking at Q1 2022, the rate increases we've taken didn't have a whole lot of impact yet, but you can see it coming in the coming quarters, and it really accelerates. We expect to see significant increases in earned premium beginning in the second half, reaching over $1.1 billion by the first quarter of next year based on the implemented rate so far. And keep in mind that additional rates and increases that we take through this year will be additive and compound on those rate increases. And given the ongoing inflationary pressure, we have increased the magnitude of rate increases we expect to take in the rest of 2022.  We remain very confident in our ability to restore auto profitability to targeted levels, and we'll keep you posted on that in our new monthly disclosures of rate filings.  So let's move to Slide 9 and take a look at something that I think is an undervalued strength at Allstate. It's our industry-leading homeowners business. As you know, a significant portion of our customers bundle home and auto, and that improves the retention and overall economics of both lines of business. We've differentiated our homeowners product and our homeowners capability really, and that goes to our product, our underwriting, our reinsurance, our claims ecosystem. It is a unique entire business model and system in the industry. The graph on the left shows the history of Allstate brand combined ratio in homeowners versus the industry and competitors. And we believe that in order to achieve an adequate return on the capital that's required in this particular line of business, you have to achieve a recorded combined ratio over time at a target of 90% or better. And as you can see from the Allstate dots on that chart, we have a long history of doing exactly that. You can also see that some of our large competitors and the industry as a whole consistently generate combined ratios that don't meet what we find as a definition of needed for a return on capital.  We've repositioned the homeowners business over a multiyear period by reducing exposure to unprofitable geographies, designing new products, creating highly sophisticated pricing plans, improving home inspection and risk selection process and sourcing capital through multiyear reinsurance programs. As a result of all of that, we've consistently generated excellent underwriting results. Since 2017, we've earned $3.3 billion or about $667 million annually in underwriting income with the industry generating an underwriting loss over that same period. Homeowners Insurance and Allstate's Homeowners Insurance is certainly not immune to the rising inflationary environment right now, though. And we see that in the form of higher labor costs and higher material costs. But our products have the sophisticated pricing features needed to respond to those changes and replacement values and help offset the impact.  The chart on the right shows key Allstate Brand Homeowners Insurance operating statistics. And there, you'll see that our net written premium has grown sharply through 2021 and into 2022, increasing 17% from the prior year. We grew policies in force by 1.7% in the first quarter. And our Allstate agents continue to be in a really good spot to broaden customer relationships with homeowners. And our average premiums rose 14.3%, mostly driven by increasing property values, as I mentioned earlier.  The first quarter combined ratio of 83.3% generated $368 million of underwriting income for the Allstate brand. In short, our property insurance business is a competitive advantage, and we aim to continue to leverage that advantage and grow it. And we look forward to sharing additional insights on homeowners with you during our upcoming special topic call on June 16. And with that, I will turn it over to Mario. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Glenn. Let's move to Slide 10, where we'll discuss how we're improving customer value through cost reductions. The chart on the slide shows the adjusted expense ratio, which is a metric we introduced a couple of quarters ago. This starts with our underwriting expense ratio, excluding restructuring, coronavirus-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and investments in advertising. It then adds in our claims expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims because catastrophe-related costs tend to bounce around quarter-to-quarter. We believe this measure provides the best insight into the underlying expense trends within our Property-Liability business.  Through innovation and strong execution, we've achieved more than 3 points of improvement since 2018. Over time, we expect to drive an additional 2 points of improvement from rent levels, achieving an adjusted expense ratio of approximately 23 by year-end 2024. This represents approximately a 6-point reduction compared to 2018, enabling an improved competitive position relative to our competitors while maintaining attractive returns. While the adjusted expense ratio increased compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher employee-related costs, we remain committed to our 3-year reduction goals.  Not included in this measure, but in the reported expense ratio was an increase in advertising expenses versus the prior year quarter as we took advantage of a drop in advertising costs and a seasonal increase in direct shopping to ship spending earlier in the year. Advertising will fluctuate throughout the year as we implement auto price increases and could impact near-term growth. Our future cost reduction efforts are focused on digitization, sourcing and operating efficiency and distribution-related costs.  Slide 11, diagrams Transformative Growth with increase market share. This multiyear initiative is designed to increase personal property-liability market share by building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution. This will be accomplished by delivering on 5 key objectives : improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition, deploying new technology ecosystems and enhancing organizational capabilities. We made significant progress across each objective in 2021 and are continuing the momentum in 2022.  While the current auto operating environment required rapid price increases, we are confident this plan will generate long-term growth. Starting at the top of the flywheel, we have reduced expenses to improve customer value with more competitive prices while earning target returns. We are building simple, affordable and connected protection solutions that are competitively differentiated. We have enhanced and expanded distribution, including modifying the Allstate agent model to increase growth and decrease distribution costs. We also improved the strength of our direct channel capabilities by leveraging the Allstate brand and significantly expanded in the independent agent channel through National General.  Differentiated products and expanded distribution are supported by increased marketing sophistication and investment. New technology ecosystems lower cost, support protection offerings and improved service and speed to market. This comprehensive approach is like a flywheel that creates sustainable competitive advantage, leading to market share growth. At the bottom of the page, you can see the 5 cases of Transformative Growth. We continue to make meaningful progress as we execute on building the new model in Phase III and begin to scale the new model in Phase 4.  Moving to Slide 12. You can see how expanding customer access better meets customer demand. Starting on the bar on the lower left, you can see the auto insurance industry written premium distribution by channel in 2020 was roughly 1/3 exclusive agency, 1/3 direct and 1/3 independent agency. Allstate's pre Transformative Growth distribution auto new business as of year-end 2019 is shown in the middle bar in Allstate's first quarter 2022 distribution is shown on the right. As you can see, today, the distribution of new business more closely mirrors the industry due to Transformative Growth and the acquisition of National General. The National General acquisition significantly increased our presence in the independent agent channel and offers future growth potential by expanding middle-market product offerings. Direct sales capabilities were improved and expanded from the Esurance base, including the use of the Allstate Brand with lower pricing in this channel. Allstate agents are and will continue to be the competitive strength as an incentive shift to growth and costs are reduced. Today, the source of new business matches customer preferences and drove a 14% increase in new business applications in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter.  Slide 13 shows the profitable growth of Protection Services. Revenues, which exclude the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives increased 13.6% to $627 million in the quarter. The increase in revenues was driven by continued growth at Allstate Protection Plans, generating a 19.6% increase in revenues to $329 million compared to the prior year quarter. Policies in force also increased 4.7%, reflecting growth in Allstate Protection Plans and Allstate Identity Protection. Protection Services policies in force of $147 million are approximately 4x that of property liability, showing how ubiquitous the Allstate brand is becoming. Adjusted net income of $53 million for the first quarter of 2022 increased $4 million compared to the prior year quarter after generating $179 million of adjusted net income for all of 2021.  Moving to Slide 14. Allstate Health and Benefits standing product offering generated growth and income. The acquisition of National General in 2021 added both group and individual health products to our portfolio, as you can see on the left. Revenues of $581 million in the first quarter of 2022 increased 4.9% to the prior year quarter, driven by higher premiums and contract charges and other revenue, primarily in Group Hub. Adjusted net income of $53 million decreased $12 million from the prior year quarter, driven by increased individual and group health lifes.  Now let's shift to Slide 15, which highlights our investment performance in the reduction of fixed income duration to reduce enterprise exposure to inflation. Net investment income totaled $594 million in the quarter, which is $114 million below the prior year quarter as shown in the chart on the left. Performance-based income, shown in dark blue, was $72 million below the prior year quarter, but 2021 was an exceptional year for private equity markets and reported income. While results are lower compared to a strong prior year, the performance-based annualized yield of 14% in the first quarter is above long-term average performance. Market-based income, shown in blue, was $31 million below the prior year quarter. As we've discussed, our market-based portfolio yield has declined in the lower interest rate environment over the last few years, with reinvestment rates below our average fixed income portfolio yield. The fixed income yield was further reduced by actions we took in the fourth quarter of 2021 to lower portfolio duration and reduce the negative impact higher inflation and interest rates would have on our fixed income portfolio valuations. The chart on the right illustrates our proactive management of interest rate exposure over the interest rate cycle. After shortening duration late in the fourth quarter of 2021, we further reduced duration by 0.7 years in the first quarter. The increase in interest rates in the quarter decreased our fixed income valuations by $2 billion, resulting in a negative portfolio return of 2.8%. However, our interest rate risk mitigation lowered the negative impact of higher interest rates by approximately $800 million versus our position at the end of the third quarter of last year. The shorter duration portfolio also positions us to reinvest in higher market yields as interest rates continue to rise. Now let's move to Slide 16, which highlights Allstate's strong capital position. Adjusted net income return on equity of 12.8% was below the prior year period due to lower auto insurance underwriting income. Allstate's strong capital position continues to enable significant cash returns to shareholders. We returned $1 billion through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends in the first quarter of 2022. Common shares outstanding were reduced by 8.1% over the last 12 months, 16.9% since 2018 and 45% since 2011, reflecting our history of providing strong cash returns to shareholders. As of March 31, 2022, we had $2.5 million remaining on the current $5 billion share repurchase program, which is expected to be completed by early 2023.  With that context, let's open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Josh Shanker of Bank of America. Joshua Shanker : I guess, the Agency segment, you guys added 159,000 auto policies in the quarter net and lost 5,000 homeowners policies. I don't know if those are our encompass policies or if those are net gen policies. But it does seem like you're adding a lot of monoline auto, which is a lower persistency than the overall Allstate book. Given where your pricing is in the net gen book, how comfortable are you with the monoline drivers you're adding right now? And what is the strategy there on April of 2022 versus where it will be in 1.5 years? Thomas Wilson : Josh, let me go up and then I'll let Glenn take the specific part. So we bought National General in part to get into the monoline stuff you're talking about. So we wanted -- we needed a stronger presence in the nonstandard business, particularly designed with the products and the pricing on it. We also thought we had -- and see great potential with the independent agent business. And so our goal is to take that strength in nonstandard, add our standard auto insurance and our homeowners product to that portfolio and really leverage the distribution. So you should -- we expect to see not only just growth from picking up new product line but also by expanding our existing product line through that distribution. . The homeowners piece is basically we got to make them us. We're really good at homeowners. I think they were okay at homeowners. And so you see some of the reduction being us getting their profit targets to where they need to be. Glenn, why don't you take the specifics of how that works? Glenn Shapiro : Great. And thanks for the question, Josh. So it is definitely 2 different stories on the auto and home, as Tom mentioned. So auto, the first quarter is the shopping quarter in nonstandard auto. It's by far the biggest shopping quarter and our National General team did a really nice job of being in the market in the right places in the places they felt they had good profitability and the right pricing and growing effectively. So think of that one as -- and you're right, it's shorter duration business in terms of lifetime value, but that is their business model and they make a good return on those policies. So they grew auto in that way. . As Tom just mentioned, on the homeowner side, this has been a shift to the homeowner strategy in NatGen time that we're in we're really taking the Allstate strength and making it a strength of NatGen. So they've had to get some pricing in there. They haven't -- they've shrunk a bit in homeowners, but that's setting ourselves up for than the strategy part of this, which is as we get our middle-market products based on that Allstate data and the Allstate capabilities into the independent agent channel marketed as National General and Allstate company, the endorsed branding, that we think we have a really great opportunity to grow homeowners with the Allstate level of sophistication and pricing and all the things I talked about in the opening remarks. But in a channel, we really haven't meaningfully been in before. So that's the path forward. But as we sit from a 1-quarter basis, we're still in, I guess, correction mode of the homeowners business there, but in a really good quarter and in a really good place from a nonstandard auto standpoint. Joshua Shanker : Okay. And [indiscernible] reputation is the only person who asked a question is about Allstate Protection Plans. I want to go to another area that never gets any questions. Allstate Commercial, as I calculated, it seems like you guys are running at about 120% combined ratio in that business, but growing very quickly. What is it and what exactly is going on there? And maybe I'm wrong. Thomas Wilson : No. We always appreciate your precision, Josh. First, I am not pleased -- none of us are pleased with the results of Allstate Business Insurance. So we review -- we've done a bunch of work to improve the profitability in that line. There's really 2 parts to the business. And one is the, what I would just call traditional commercial insurers, small contract or stuff like that, that we sell through Allstate agents. And then there's the shared economy business. And it's a shared economy business that has been trouble for us from a profitability standpoint, particularly a home-sharing company and then some states in the transportation network companies. . And we made a decision last year that we weren't going to chase revenue if we didn't think that the states were profitable. So we exited a number of states. I think 3 big states, in particular, in the transportation network piece because they were not profitable. And then the home-sharing business, we just got out of that contract altogether. Glenn, do you want to -- what would you like to add to that? Glenn Shapiro : I would just add that if you look at -- when you're talking about the premium growth there, it is 2 things in large part. One is, we've raised rates in sort of the traditional small commercial business we have. So rates are materially up, units are not. The other is that a year ago, transportation business is -- because we have -- the charge by mile and we pay them for the usage. A year ago, there was very little usage still in those transportation networks, and there's a lot more usage and therefore, a lot more premium right now. And we have raised, as Tom said, we've gotten out of some states and we've raised rates on those. So we think the profitability go forward is better. So it's not growth in that we're piling on business as we've gotten a lot more revenue coming through. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Greg Peters of Raymond James. Charles Peters : I appreciate the new information and your updated investor slide deck, just FYI. So I'm going to focus my one question on Slide 8. And I'm just trying to put the pieces together of the information you provided us around pricing. Tom, you mentioned in your opening remarks, surgical pricing, and you talked about how you're differentiating between lower lifetime value customers and longer lifetime values. Glenn, you talked about a lot of rate in the pipeline that's going to affect earned premium going forward.  And I was trying to reconcile the language difference from your February cat and pricing report to your March cat and pricing report. And the difference between the 2, just 1 month later in the March pricing report, you said that that effectively lost cost inflations were exceeding your targets and you were going to have to raise prices even more, just 1 month later from your February pricing report. So I was hoping maybe you could put all those pieces together for us and sort of map out what's going on. Glenn Shapiro : Tom, did you want to start on that? Or do you want me to? Thomas Wilson : Yes, sorry, I was on mute. It was quite articulate but -- great. Let me start off and then I'll get Glenn and Mario to give you more specifics. So first, obviously, increasing price is really important to getting our auto insurance possibility. We've been aggressive, but we believe smart about spreading it between newer less profitable customers and profitable longer-tenure customers. And so obviously, let's say you have a customer who's been with you 10 years and you're making a 95% combined ratio, and you have one that's new and you're losing money on it.  And you have to raise your rates to cover the higher inflation, which impacts both customers. If you give them both the same amount, you run the risk of losing that long-tenured profitable customer. So we've put less rate into our, what we would call, older closed books and more into our newer books with shorter-term customers. And we believe that, that protects lifetime value and will help with retention. In this new space, retention is going to be a challenge for all companies. And so we're -- but we're trying to make sure we manage our way through it. So the numbers that you see on Slide 8 are the total between all the customers, whether new old profitable, unprofitable to help us get there. But it's more surgical than it appears. I would say the other part is what we're doing auto profitability back to Glenn's earlier slide was like we know how to make money in auto insurance, and we're going to make money in auto insurance. But we want to make sure it's sustainable.  One is the way we're taking those prices. Two is make sure the expense reductions are permanent, not just temporary, making sure you manage your loss costs differently, and just make sure you're being -- continuing to invest in sophistication and new products. So we feel good about this, but then hopefully, that provides some insight. As to the change in the outlook, that maybe be more what we said than just sort of like waking up in the month of March and deciding we're going to say something different. Glenn, do you want to talk about how this has unfolded. And Mario, if you're going to go onto closures, that would be helpful. Glenn Shapiro : Yes. So I'll start with how it unfolded. I mean -- I would say, we continue to see inflation run like a lot of people continue to see. We continue to see elongated time frames for development, including prior year development. And so we're taking, I think, an appropriately conservative view and saying that like we're going to need more rate on that part of it. The other part on the precision, I want to build on what Tom said, because it's an important point because we do use a lot of precision. And I think that there some folks who talk more -- or some companies talk more or less about their level of segmentation and precision. We maybe don't do a good enough job talking about the depth that we have in terms of our segmentation, which is highly sophisticated and that's what Tom is going into. But it's sophistication at that level, but also on the go-to-market level. Because clearly, we kept marketing open, and we took an opportunity to grow some business that the economics were good on. We did that because the marketing cost itself was down with others leaving that area. There were a lot of shoppers and first quarter tends to be a time that a lot of people shop. . Now we also did that with a lot of precision. It's the entire go-to-market system because we're not just -- to sort of have the open sign everywhere. It is -- we're marketing precisely where we know we have a lifetime value return based on risk type based on market within state level. And it's a combination of underwriting, marketing, pricing that all comes together -- and distribution that all comes together with how we go to market and drive where we want to grow and how we want to grow that I think goes into the need for rate as well. Mario Rizzo : Yes. If I can just add, Greg, this is Mario. First, I guess, where I'd start is, the objective of providing that rate information monthly that we started this year was really to create a level of transparency into what we were doing with auto profitability with rates being such a significant lever and provide you all with a view of the progress we're making but also some color around what we're seeing on a forward-looking basis. So that's the objective. And the language we used in the most recent disclosure provided, I think, some additional context.  In terms of what's happening, I think we continue to look at loss trends month-in and month-out, both in terms of reserve levels, severe trends and just loss trends overall. And the statement we made in our most recent release was really a reflection of what we were seeing in loss trends in severity development both in terms of what we saw in last year, we strengthened reserves by $151 million in auto this quarter and what we were seeing in terms of the physical damage severity escalation as well as what -- how that translated into current year severity. So we're taking that data. We're looking at it. We're working with the pricing team and factoring it into our outlook and the purpose of the disclosure again is to tell you what we did, but also provide a little more texture around what we're seeing in the market. . Operator : Next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman of Credit Suisse. Andrew Kligerman : Yes, great answer to the prior question. I guess you didn't mention anything about non-rate actions. Would it be possible to discuss nonrate actions as as maybe a percent of the business that you're able to get that on and maybe how much that might be contributing to improved performance? Thomas Wilson : Glenn, do you want to take that for both the Allstate Brand and National General? Glenn Shapiro : Yes. So one, and if you saw the -- I'll go to the National General first, we saw that National General underlying combined ratio looked pretty good in the first quarter. And one of the things that they have that's really stable is fee structure. The fee structure is a nonrate element that turns out to be really stable over time and helps them predict and plan for their combined ratio. When I think about nonrate actions across the Allstate book, it really goes back to what I was talking about where it's about -- I don't like to isolate it to the word underwriting because then it sounds like you're sort of deciding to write or not to write as opposed to getting the right level of rate for each type of risk, but that also goes into with underwriting and marketing and distribution how you go to market. And where we've really built our sophistication is in how our marketing team, our underwriting and product teams and pricing and our distribution organization deploy resources quickly and nimbly to where and how we're looking to grow. And I think that in itself generates a lot of the long-term economic value that we drive. Andrew Kligerman : Okay. So really not any real actions to -- okay, makes a lot of sense. And then if I could just quickly sneak one in. The buyback of $794 million that's pretty fast in terms of the pace. I thought you had about $3.3 billion left, and this implies you're going at a quicker pace. Is there a chance that you could complete that authorization by the end of this year or do more than you anticipated because it seems pretty robust and I was curious about the thinking there. Thomas Wilson : Andrew, it's Tom. First, on the actions. You will see though -- I know you will see some things like down-pay requirements and stuff like that, that we will change going forward to help manage the selection of the business. So Glenn is absolutely right that we're being very precise in which stuff we want, but if we feel like there are certain policy terms and things we can change or payment terms that we can change that will help us, we will put those in place. . On the buyback Mario is committed to have it done early in the first quarter of next year. Mario, anything you want to add to that? Mario Rizzo : No, I think that's right, Tom. So I wouldn't read too much into any one quarter. We still have $2.5 billion left to buy. We said we'll complete it by early next year, and that's the point. Operator : Next question comes from the line of David Motemaden of Evercore ISI. . David Motemaden : I had a question on Slide 8. It says that you guys have a higher mix of newer, more expensive vehicles. Glenn, I believe you said that those vehicles come with higher premiums, and they can adversely impact total loss severity when vehicle values rise. Does the fact that you have more of a mix of more expensive vehicles, does that increase -- or does that mean that you need to take more rate relative to peers? Or I guess, how should I interpret this mix difference that you guys have versus peers? Thomas Wilson : Glenn, do you want to do that? Glenn Shapiro : Yes. So there's a few parts to that because I'll talk more macro about the auto -- the car park out there and like the whole system. With every new model year newer that we get and every year that passes, we've done the math through what's in our book of business, what type of safety elements are in cars, accident avoidance, technology and everything. And we know 2 things : one, that we get a little bit of a tailwind with every year that passes on frequency, and we get a little bit of a headwind on severity because they're more expensive to fix, more sensors and so on. And the reason I started there is that would be true of this example as well. The fact that our book of business tends to trend that way more, it will give us a little bit of a sustainable benefit on frequency in comparison to others, and it will give us a little bit of a sustainable headwind on the severity.  But we do charge premium based on make and model year and you get a higher premium for it. It was more of a statement in that opening that as we look at and we try to put our trends, whether we're looking at Fast Track or looking at public disclosures, when we look at our trends on bodily injury or property damage, which are third-party vehicles, and then collision first-party vehicles, we see some of that difference come through and then have to like do the math back to our premium and ensure that we're getting the right rates for all of that. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Meyer Shields : Fantastic. I wanted to dig in a little more to your comments on homeowners and the automatic lift because we've seen a little bit of deterioration in the underlying loss ratio all of last year into the first quarter. Is the automatic, I guess, inflation guard changing? Are there other steps that are necessary in homeowners? Thomas Wilson : Well, the first, we're really happy with where the homeowners business is today in terms of its profitability. As you know, sometimes it bounces around because catastrophes -- we had slightly lower catastrophes this quarter than the prior year quarter, but still earn a really good return. The underlying combined ratio, as you point out, which excludes catastrophes, ticked up a little bit. We feel comfortable with where that is in part because of the inflation parts that you mentioned that come through, what we call PIA, Property Insurance Adjustment. It really raises average premium. And as that burns in to earn premium just like it does burn through in auto that cover some of those increased costs. If it doesn't, we have plenty of room to go in and continue to prices. Glenn, what would you add about severity in the combined ratio in [indiscernible]? Glenn Shapiro : Yes. So first, I always start with I think we're accountable for the recorded combined ratio because ultimately, if we always had a good underlying but like we hadn't gotten the right reinsurance or we hadn't been in the right locations, and we hadn't done good risk mapping for wildfire or hail or hurricane or any other exposure and we were constantly running what the industry or key competitors run. I think you would rightfully hold us accountable for that. So I always go back to the recorded combined ratio. That said, the underlying, as Tom said, it moves up and down a little bit, and we do watch that primarily though we watch the recorded combined ratio.  Right now, like Tom, I feel really good about where we are. Severity ran hot in the first quarter. It's tough to look at one quarter in homeowners and draw a lot of conclusions because there's a decent amount of volatility between the mix of perils in homeowners. It's not nearly as stable as auto in that way. And so we're watching that, that was a high number, but we got an average price increase, average earned premium of 14.3% burning through, which really ticked up in the latter part of the year last year. So we'll continue to give us benefit as that earns through. And we're in -- obviously, we're really good shape in homeowners, and I feel good about it. Meyer Shields : Okay. That's helpful. Second question on the auto side. I just want to make sure that I'm understanding the commentary on the surgical application of rate increases, should we expect, I guess, suppressed new business as the strategy works its way through to the extent that rate increases are being focused on lower tenured customers? . Thomas Wilson : I'll start off and then Glenn, you can jump in. I think a lot of this premier depends on what happens in the competitive environment. So as other people are taking rents, it depends where they're spreading their rates. So if you buy on the renewal book, then that will create more shoppers because those tend to be people who shop less than just putting it all on the new business. But part of it depends what happens, how people do it. That said we feel pretty good about where we track our competitive position, the LTI index with our LTI Index at this point. So we're hopeful that as we move through this, we'll still continue to grow. With Transformative Growth on top of that, we think that it all still hangs together in terms of increasing market share. Glenn, what would you add to that? Glenn Shapiro : I'll just add if you take the long term and the short term, the long term first, as Tom said, our expanded customer access, our work on improving value as we get the 3 points at cost that Mario talked about out and we've got access into all these systems, and we get middle market products into the IA channel and our exclusive agents are humming, we've got a really good long-term prognosis on that. . With your question, you were asking, I think, some about the short term. So as you think about what we did early this year, we pulled marketing dollars forward, and we've talked about the fact that we pulled them forward. That's not the same as increasing them. It did increase in the quarter, but it's pulling it forward. That means it does have to come out of somewhere, too. We decided to do that because there were good economics on the marketing. A number of companies publicly talked about pulling back from marketing that left from the supply and demand curve of marketing costs that left it reasonable, and there was good economics on it, plus a lot of business gets sold in the first quarter.  So we thought with a lot of shoppers in the market with rates out there, that it would be a good time to be in the market where we had our prices in, and we felt good about the lifetime value. That said, inflation is continuing to run and we're taking more rate, and we pulled that money forward from later. So marketing will reduce from this point and that could have a short-term impact on new business growth, plus we've got -- everybody will have headwinds on retention with the amount of rate that's in the system across the industry. Thomas Wilson : Yes. I think when you go back to Glenn's long term. Bottom we like prospects for sustainable profitable growth. I mean, auto insurance, we know how to buy money and with transformative growth, we really grow that business. You add homeowners on top of that, which is really a growth business. And just like price and value are important to auto insurance customers, it's also important in investing. And when you look at the price of Allstate, it's essentially less than your other options. That's why we think transformative growth is going to increase nation multiples. . Operator : Next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS. Brian Meredith : A quick question here. On Slide 11 of your supplement, you've got an interesting chart here that looks at auto state profitability. Just my question is, is this based on an earned kind of basis? Or is on a written basis. And if it's on an earned basis, how would this chart look on a written basis, as far as what states do you think are currently pretty close to rate adequate? Thomas Wilson : Well, that's a tough question. I don't know if we -- Glenn, do you want to take the forward looking. Glenn Shapiro : Yes, I'll take it. Yes. So it's definitely earned basis in that we look at our when you look at combined ratios, it's on an earned basis. So you're hitting a really important point. So it's an astute observation. Because I think about that disclosure and you could look at -- when you look at the percentage of states that are above 100, for example, that is not the same as looking at the way we look at where do we want to grow. Because the state could be above 100 right now, but we've just gotten in the rate we feel we need to be adequate. So any new business we put on is going to be at a rate adequate level that we like, and we would want to grow there. So it really does lag and you have to go back to Page 8 and see where that -- which we don't -- because that's an estimate. We don't estimate every state and disclose based on when we'll earn the premiums and what percentage will earn by state and what that will do. But the point is, while that's a snapshot of where we are today, that does not reflect all of the written premiums and increases that we've got. . Thomas Wilson : Okay. Well, thank you all for engaging with us today. As we go forward, we look forward to in the next month or so talking about homeowners -- and then we continue to execute in the meantime our multi-facet fan, both to improve profitability of auto insurance and to get Transformative Growth because that's a key component to sustainable growth, and both of those will improve shareholder value. So thank you for your engagement, and we'll talk to you soon. Operator : Thank you so much to our presenters and to everyone who participated. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mark Nogal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Nogal : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session.  Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted today's presentation on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2021 and other public documents for information on potential risks. Additionally, we will be hosting our next special topic investor call on September 1, focusing on Allstate's investment strategy.  Now I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas Wilson : Well, good morning. Thank you for investing your time with Allstate today. Let's start on Slide 2.  So Allstate's strategy to increase shareholder value has 2 components : increase personal property-liability market share and expand Protection services, which are shown in the 2 ovals on the left. We're building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution we transformed the growth. We're also diversifying our business by expanding protection offers and by leveraging the Allstate brand, customer base capabilities and expanding distribution. On the panel on the right, in the second quarter, we made progress executing this strategy, while we continue to implement a comprehensive strategy to improve profitability. That includes broadly raising auto and home insurance rates. In the second half of 2022, we plan to file for rate increases in excess of the increases implemented in the first half of this year, which were 6.1% of Allstate brand countrywide premiums. We're also reducing expenses on advertising and growth investments. Underwriting guidelines have been and will be changed to reduce new business volume, where we're not earning adequate returns. And we're also executing claims operating actions to manage loss cost in a high inflationary environment. These actions will likely have a negative impact on policy growth.  And now while the current environment requires a huge focus on margin improvement, we continue to advance our transformative growth strategy where profitability -- when profitability levels are acceptable we'll have a business model to capture market share.  The Protection Services businesses are generating profitable growth, although earnings declined slightly this quarter as we invest in that growth. Given the negative impact of inflation on the auto insurance business, as you know, beginning late last year, we reduced the bond portfolio duration to lower exposure to higher interest rates, which helped mitigate the reduction in bond valuations by approximately $1.3 billion in the first half of 2022. Our strong capital position enabled us to maintain high cash returns to shareholders in this environment.  Moving to Slide 3, let's review second quarter performance in more detail. Total revenues decreased 3.4% in the prior year quarter, despite property liability premiums earned increasing 8.6%, which reflected higher average premiums and policy growth. Higher loss costs in the current report year and upward loss reserve development of $411 million in the prior report years resulted in a property liability recorded combined ratio of 107.9 in the second quarter.  Net investment income of $562 million was 42% below the prior year quarter since performance-based income was exceptional in the prior year. Net losses on investments and derivatives were $733 million in the quarter as lower valuations and equity investments and losses on fixed income sales, which were only partially offset by the derivative gains associated with the bond portfolio duration shortening. The combination of these factors led to a net loss of $1.4 billion in the second quarter and an adjusted net loss of $209 million or $0.76 per diluted share.  The adjusted net income return on equity was 6.9% over the last 12 months, which is obviously unacceptable from our standpoint. It's substantially below the levels we achieved at this time last year, but we remain committed to achieving our long-term returns on equity of between 14% and 17%.  Now let me turn it over to Glenn to talk -- walk through our property liability results in more detail. Glenn Shapiro : Thank you, Tom. Let's start by reviewing underwriting profitability on Slide 4. The underwriting results reflect the high level of inflation, which is increasing severity leading to an underlying combined ratio of 93.4 for the second quarter and a recorded combined ratio of 107.9, which is shown in the chart on the left.  The chart on the right compares last year's recorded combined ratio of 95.7 to this year's second quarter. A higher auto insurance underlying loss ratio drove 8.6 of the 12.2 point increase as claims severity has been increasing faster than earned rate increases. The other large negative impact was from prior year reserve strengthening this quarter, which I'll cover in a few minutes. The one positive impact on there was the 1.7 points from expense reductions.  Let's move to Slide 5 and talk about profitability and rising loss costs in more detail. As you know, we have a target combined ratio for auto insurance in the mid-90s. And you can see on the chart, which shows the combined ratio by year and then the first 2 quarters of this year, that we have a long history of meeting or exceeding those targets, which is supported by our pricing sophistication, underwriting, claims expertise and expense management. Now in there, you'll see 2020 was an outlier because we had much better than target results than due to some of the early pandemic frequency impacts. And as we move from that environment to the high inflationary environment we're in today, incurred claims severities increased the underlying auto combined ratio of 102.1 for the quarter and 100.5 year-to-date.  Auto non-catastrophe prior year reserve strengthening in the second quarter totaled $275 million, which is primarily physical damage and injury coverages. The most significant impact, though, on the combined ratio was report year incurred severity for collision, property damage and bodily injury claims, which increased by 16%, 12% and 9%, respectively, over the average of the full year 2021 incurred. Because the costs were rising rapidly during 2021, the quarter-to-quarter increase comparison is even greater. And frequency also went up about 5 to 7 points, but it's still well below pre-pandemic levels.  So let's go to Slide 6, and we'll go deeper into the prior year physical damage for reserve development. The chart on the left shows used car values. They began to rise in 2020. And if you go back looking from the beginning of 2019 to current, used car prices have gone up more than 60% and continue to stay at an elevated level. At the same time, OEM parts and labor rates have increased during the first half of this year, which causes severity increases for coverages like collision and property damage. Now we anticipated that those trends and the delays that are taking cars a long time to be repaired right now would increase the amount of claim payments we made on 2021 losses after the end of the year, even though these are relatively short-duration claims.  The chart on the right shows gross paid losses for physical damage coverages for the 6 months after the end of the calendar year. Now our expectation for paid losses for 2021 claims from months 13 to 18 was that it would be about $1.25 billion, which you can see from the chart is about 40% above the prior year. You can see that from the dash line on the far right bar compared to the bars to the left of it. But at the end of the second quarter, the actual paid losses were $1.48 billion, which exceeded even our higher estimate by $230 million and is a large driver of the prior year reserve increases. All other non-catastrophe prior year development, primarily from injury, commercial auto and homeowners, totaled $268 million in the quarter.  Let's go to Slide 7 and discuss how higher auto insurance rates have been and will be implemented to improve profitability. Since the beginning of the year, we've implemented broad rate increases across the country, as shown on the map, at 9 states where we had increases over 10%, and auto rates have been increased in 48 locations, inclusive of Canadian provinces. Those rate increases are expected to increase Allstate brand annualized written premium by 6.1%. Now we have not been able to get adequate rate in New York or any increase in rate in California. New York represents about 9% of our auto premium. And the implemented rate there was, we leveraged the annual flex filings process there. And it gave us less than 5% rate in our current indicated indication there is significantly higher than that to get to an adequate return.  Similarly, in California, which represents about 12% of our auto premium, we recently filed in the second quarter, a 6.9% increase, which again is significantly below the overall rate need there. In states markets, risk segments or channels where we cannot achieve an adequate price for the risk, we're implementing more restrictive underwriting actions and reducing new business as needed until adequate levels of rate are approved.  Let's move to Slide 8, and we'll look at how these rate increases are impacting and will impact the combined ratio for auto insurance. What you see here illustrates our path to target profitability, along with the magnitude of actions we've already taken and what's required prospectively.  Starting on the left. Through the first 6 months of the year, our auto insurance recorded combined ratio is 105, and that's shown in the blue bar. To start with, we normalized that by removing the impact of prior year reserve increases and going to a 5-year average on catastrophe losses, that improves the combined ratio by 2.5 points represented by the first green bar.  The second green bar reflects the estimated impact of rate actions already implemented when fully earned into premium. So these are already implemented actions that are in market and renewing on policies. They total an additional $1.7 billion of effective premium across Allstate and national general brands. Those will be earned over the coming quarters and fully earned by the end of 2023. Now of course, loss costs will continue to increase, whether it's inflationary impacts on severity or higher frequency, which would increase the combined ratio from what I just described there. So prospective rate increases must exceed the loss cost increases that come to achieve our target returns.  Now everything I just described, combined with our non-rate actions such as reducing new business and expenses, gives us a track where we expect to achieve our target combined ratio in the mid-90s in auto insurance. Now the timing of that will be largely dependent on the relative increases and pace of these increases in premium and loss costs.  So on Page 9, we'll take a look again at our industry-leading homeowners business. As you know, a significant portion of our customers, bundle home and auto insurance, and that improves the retention and the overall economics of both products. We have a differentiated ecosystem in homeowners. That includes a differentiated product, underwriting, reinsurance, claim capabilities, and we discussed a lot of those capabilities in our last special topic call.  Our long-term underwriting results show the strength of the system. Our 5-year average reported combined ratio is 91.9, as shown in the chart on the left. And that produced $3.3 billion of underwriting profit since 2017, while the industry lost over $20 billion in that same period.  Now our second quarter combined ratio and most second quarter combined ratios have historically been higher than full year results, primarily due to catastrophes. And second quarter this year was at 106.9, which reflected again higher catastrophes and 1.7 points of unfavorable non-catastrophe prior year reserve estimates.  Our year-to-date recorded combined ratio for home is 95.8. Now homeowners insurance is certainly not immune to the inflationary environment we're in, and we continue to see increases in labor and material costs. To combat that, our product has sophisticated pricing features that respond to changes in replacement values, and we've taken rate.  If you see on the chart on the right that shows some of the key Allstate brand homeowners operating statistics, we've grown net written premium by 15.2% from the prior year. And that's on a policy base that we grew of 1.2% in the second quarter, where our Allstate agents remain in a really good position to broaden customer relationships.  So as you've heard me say several times and certainly in our last special topic call, we're really well positioned at homeowners to not only maintain the competitive advantage we have, but to grow that line of business.  And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mario. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Glenn. As Tom mentioned, while we are improving profitability, we also continue to invest in the core components of the transformative growth strategy to increase market share in the personal property-liability business.  Slide 10 is the flywheel of growth that we have discussed on earlier calls. Transformative growth is a multiyear initiative designed to increase personal property-liability market share by building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution.  I won't get into all the pieces today, but I want to highlight 2 specific items : first, we remain committed to achieving our adjusted expense ratio goal of 23 by year-end 2024, which represents a 6-point improvement compared to year-end 2018; secondly, in the quarter, we launched beta versions of a new fully digital auto insurance product and sales experience made possible with new technology for relationship initiation and product delivery. Building these foundational elements will enable us to scale growth when adequate insurance pricing is a tank.  At the same time, the Protection Services businesses, in the lower strategic oval, are growing and increasing shareholder value, as shown on Slide 11.  Revenues, excluding the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, increased 8.3% to $629 million in the quarter, primarily driven by Allstate Protection Plans. Adjusted net income of $43 million for the second quarter of 2022 decreased $13 million compared to the prior year quarter as ongoing investments and growth are being made to position these businesses for future success.  Policies in force did decrease by 1.6%, reflecting expiring Protection Plan warranties and lower retail sales compared to the favorable environment in the prior year quarter. Moving to Slide 12. Allstate Health and Benefits is also growing. It is also growing an attractive set of businesses that protect millions of policyholders. The acquisition of National General in 2021 added both group and individual health products to our portfolio, as you can see on the left.  Revenues of $574 million in the second quarter of 2022 increased to 4.6% for the prior year quarter, driven primarily by growth in group and individual health businesses. Adjusted net income of $65 million increased $3 million from the prior year quarter, driven by increased revenue, which was partially offset by a higher benefit ratio, primarily in individual health.  Now let's shift to investments on Slide 13 to review investment performance and the portfolio risk and return position we have taken given higher inflation and the possibility of a recession. Net investment income totaled $562 million in the quarter, which is $412 million below the prior year quarter, as shown in the chart on the left.  Market-based income, shown in blue, was $13 million above the prior year quarter, reflecting an increase in the fixed income portfolio yields, which are now benefiting from investing in yields that are higher than the overall portfolio's current yield. Performance-based income of $236 million, shown in dark blue, was $413 million below with an exceptional quarter in 2021. The performance-based internal rate of return over the last 12 months was 24.6%, which remains above our long-term return expectations. The performance-based portfolio includes private equity as well as a mix of other asset types such as real estate and infrastructure, which diversify our performance in this segment.  In the second quarter, real estate investments had strong performance, including gains on asset sales, while private equity results were lower. As a reminder, our performance-based results are reported based on a 1 quarter lag, so second quarter results reflect March 31 sponsored financial statements, and future returns will reflect market and economic conditions from the prior quarter.  The total portfolio return was negative 2.8% for the quarter and negative 5.6% year-to-date due to higher interest rates and credit spreads, lowering the market value of bonds and a decline in public equity valuations. While these market conditions negatively impacted the market value of the portfolio, it continues to generate operating income. And because of proactive portfolio actions, the results are better than the broad indices with the S&P 500 Index 20% lower and the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index 10% lower.  The chart on the right illustrates the shift in risk positioning we have executed to protect portfolio value and position us to take advantage of opportunities as conditions evolve. We reduced interest rate risk towards the end of 2021 and into the first quarter through the sale of longer-duration bonds and the use of derivatives. The portfolio duration is shorter than our long-term targets, which has mitigated the negative impact of higher market rates by approximately $1.3 billion this year.  With recession concerns rising, the exposure to recession risk-sensitive assets was also reduced through sales of high-yield bonds, bank loans and public equity. These sales were largely executed prior to the most significant credit spread widening and equity market decline for the end of the quarter, further preserving portfolio value.  Now let's move to Slide 14 to discuss Allstate's strong cash returns to shareholders of $1.9 billion in the first 2 quarters. Over the last year, shares outstanding have been reduced by 8.7%, providing more upside per share as profitability has improved. In addition, there is another $1.8 billion remaining on the current $5 billion share repurchase authorization.  Adjusted net income return on equity of 6.9% was below the prior year period, primarily due to lower underwriting income. Achieving our target combined ratios for both auto and homeowners insurance will bring adjusted net income returns on equity back to our long-term target range of 14% to 17%.  With that context, let's open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Charles Peters : I would like to go back to Slide 8 for my first question. And I guess the 2 areas that caught my attention as you were running through them, Glenn, were the future loss costs arrow and the rate and other actions. And then in the box, you say you're pursuing larger rate increases in the second half of 2022 relative to the first half. So maybe you can give us some additional detail around what you guys are thinking on those 2 areas in that chart? Thomas Wilson : Greg, this is Tom. I'll do a bit of overviewing. Glenn, you can jump right in. First, Greg, as you know, we don't give perspective -- earnings estimates in order to give perspective line-by-line. We would expect future loss costs to go up, like we don't -- and we're booking to have them go up in the future. And we also, as we mentioned, expect to take increase in rates. With that, Glenn, do you want to provide some more perspective on both the trends you're seeing historically in loss cost and then what you're -- where we're thinking about -- how you're thinking about rate increases. Glenn Shapiro : Sure. Greg, on the loss cost piece of it, I know there's been some opinion out there that maybe the worst is behind us and the inflation will slow or just listening to other calls out there. We're not sure of that, and we certainly want to have the rate outpace the loss trends.  One thing I'll say is when you look at our frequency trend, I think this is a unique time in history where typically frequency is harder to predict than severity. And I think the opposite is true right now. Our frequency has been really, really steady. You look at it from the low points of the pandemic up to where it is now, it is just steadily crept back up but has leveled out in that creep, and we have good data and expectation that it remains below the pre-pandemic levels, but continues to rise slightly as it has.  And on the other side, severity, it's a big wild card out there, I think, in all industries right now as to how long and how severe inflation runs with the actions of the Fed and anything else out there, we're taking the conservative viewpoint that we need a lot more rate in order to offset that.  So I mentioned in the prepared remarks, a couple of places where we're having trouble on it, and we're working through it. But broadly, I will tell you, it's gone very well in that the regulators we work with, good relationships across the country, and we're getting some meaningful rates going through the pipeline right now, and they understand.  I mean the math is on our side, and we need to get those rates in to offset those future rate trends because as the slide depicts, if you froze time and loss costs didn't move, we would earn our way right to the mid-90s combined ratio over the coming quarters, but that isn't the case. We need additional rate to offset those loss trends. Charles Peters : Got it. You slipped in the reference to Slide 7 in your answer, Glenn, which was going to be my other area of focus, which is you talk about reducing new business in states without appropriate rates. In the slide, I think you -- well, you do call out California, New York, are there other states where you're having some problems getting the rate approved that you need? Or are just those the 2 principal states? Thomas Wilson : Greg, I'll let Glenn give you the specifics there. But it isn't just to like negotiate. And I'm reading into your statement. I know you're not really saying that, but it's also to just maintain our loss cost. Like we just -- even if we get a rate increase, there may be certain cells or certain segments of the state that are less -- where we have less profitability than we want. So it's also about managing profitability.  Glenn, why don't you give some specifics on that? Glenn Shapiro : Yes. And I'll just build on that because it's exactly right. It really is -- it's segments within states, it's markets within states, and it's even channels. I mean look at the fact that right now, National General is performing quite well, both from a growth and a profit standpoint. And so we can position based on where we can be profitable, whether it's channel, market, segment of risk, and that's kind of how we're thinking about new business.  We -- to put it very simply, we don't want to write new business that we're not profitable on. And it's not as simple as looking at, you can see in our disclosures, the number of states where we're above 100 or above 96. And because it's -- that's the rearview mirror.  The prospective view is where we've already gotten rates. And in some of the states that we feel good about the price we're putting on for new business and we'll grow in those.  To answer your specific question, New Jersey would be another place that we're working hard on and need to get more rate. But the vast majority of states across the country, we've been working through, and we're in good shape in. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Thomas Wilson : Jonathan, we didn't hear him. I don't know if you did or I don't know, Andrew, if you're on mute or not, but we didn't hear him. Operator : You couldn't hear him? Thomas Wilson : Now we can hear you. Now we can't. Mark Nogal : Jonathan, I think we move to the next question. We can' hear... Thomas Wilson : Andrew, maybe you want to question to Mark, and he can ask it for you, if you want. But let's move on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : I guess I'm just looking through what rates you're submitting, and that slowed down. And I'm specifically talking about auto insurance rate increase filings. It looks like the amount of the rate increase that you guys submitted during the second quarter slowed materially versus the first quarter. I'm just wondering why that was? Thomas Wilson : David, I'll make a comment and then Glenn can -- if there's anything you want to add, you might jump in. First, we are fully committed to increasing rates necessary to get our combined ratio down to the target levels that Glenn talked about, that obviously bounces around by quarter.  And what you saw is what we got implemented in the second quarter, in the early part of your question, you said submitting as in forward-looking, that's not what we're submitting. What you saw in that release is just what got implemented. We're obviously in conversations with regulators when you have these kind of increases continuously.  So there are some states where Glenn's team chooses to go down and meet with the regulators, explain the numbers and then submit it and so we feel good about where we're headed there.  Glenn, anything you want to add to that? Glenn Shapiro : Yes. I would just add, it really is about timing and about which states go through. So like if you look at the amount we filed per state, we really haven't backed off at all, David, it is the states that went through in that cycle. It just -- they aren't as large. And so the countrywide impact when you do a medium or smaller state population-wise is lesser than the big states.  We have some very large states going through the pipeline right now. And I think you'll see that timing level itself out, and it's why we're able to say to you that we are seeking more rate in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. We have some very large states with meaningful rate increases going through. David Motemaden : Got it. Yes. I was referring to -- I obviously can see the implemented rate. I was referring to submitted, which I guess is something that's -- they're not approved or disapproved yet. It's just more kind of a leading indicator that I track, and it just looked like you guys had slowed a little bit in the second quarter versus the first quarter. But it does sound like that is more timing related as well. Maybe for just another question, I was just looking through the businesses in auto specifically, and I noticed that the Allstate brand combined ratio was 9 points above the NatGen combined ratio for the quarter and has been trending -- it's been higher for the last few quarters.  Could you just -- yes, that's kind of counterintuitive to me just given the differences in those books of business. So could you just maybe talk about what's going on between those two? Thomas Wilson : David, it's an astute question, and let me -- but let me take it up a level and then get Glenn to jump into NatGen versus the Allstate brand. Because many of you have also written and asked about like how do you stand versus competitors and stuff on that? So let me just take it up and deal with that, and then we'll go into the specifics. So like you, we always look at different comparisons, whether it's internal or external, to get a sense for our performance. That said, when it's external, it tends to be more directional versus our variance analysis because of the differences in strategies and particularly it gives you got different strategies, different risk profiles, different state mix.  It's better if you look at the long-term results rather than quarterly numbers, particularly when you're using percentage changes on a quarter-by-quarter.  That said, the numbers are the numbers, and you need to understand them and evaluate them. First thing I would say is when you look at -- most of you have asked about Progressive, they're a really strong competitors, so we have great respect to them. As it relates to auto insurance over a long period of time, Allstate, Progressive and GEICO have all had attractive returns.  And we're all dealing with the impact of what I would say, a wide swings in frequency and severity for auto claims, in particular that's driven by the pandemic and then the related inflationary impacts on tower repairs and prices. They did report, that is Progressive, a better combined ratio than us this quarter as they began raising prices earlier in 2021.  But again, we don't know why, like we're not them. But they did have different trends in frequency both last year and this year. So and of course, claims statistics are different for everybody and sometimes people change them how they count them over time. But the numbers I see are that in 2020, we both had frequency declines from 2019, that was reflecting the impact of shutting down the economy. So we were down -- in collision, we were down 26%, and they were down, I think, about 23%, 24%.  Last year, their collision frequency increased by 26%, whereas ours increased by only 18%. So you would expect them to raise prices more than we raise them. This year, they're down in frequency, and we're up. So you would expect our combined ratio to be higher than theirs.  It's hard to say why these short-term trends are different. But Glenn will talk, it may be that they have a relatively small share of the customer statement that they call the Robinson. And so the comparison to NatGen will be helpful for you to see how that's different. It could be state mix. It could be a whole bunch of other things. So I can't intuit exactly the results.  And so Glenn will go through that risk mix and show you how that impacts the different results.  As it relates to the strength of the business model, though, and your strategy, I think it's also worthwhile looking at other lines. And as we talked about on our last call, Allstate is an industry leader in homeowners with very attractive combined ratios. The reported combined ratio this quarter, again, is higher, as Glenn talked about, than it typically is in the second quarter.  On a longer-term basis, though, we've obviously done quite well.  To put that in perspective, if we had 112.5 combined ratio on our homeowners business, last year, our underwriting income would have been about $1.6 billion lower than it actually was, and that's particularly hard on a business that requires twice as much capital as auto insurance.  As it relates to commitment to profitability, speed, precision, we dramatically reshaped that business, which we took you through. So our business models tend to be good and precise, we tend to look at both lines of business and see how we're doing.  With that, Glenn, do you want to talk about NatGen versus the Allstate rate? Glenn Shapiro : Yes, I will. Well, David, you're getting a good detailed answer there from Tom and after me, you like hit the daily double here because it is a really good question and an important one.  I want to take you back and kind of look at it over the 18 months that we've owned NatGen and since the closing of that deal, and it's a good time frame to use because 18 months is the time it takes to earn out the full annualized premium changes also.  So you go back to first quarter 2021, and this would be true, by the way, not only of comparison of Allstate brand and NatGen but Allstate to other competitors, like Tom was talking about. Allstate was running a combined ratio about 10 points lower. And the reason for that was the frequency was lower, frequency on more nonstandard or near nonstandard business came back much quicker as people needed to use their cars to make a living, and there was just a difference between different books of business.  And so as a result, the good news was for the Allstate brand was that is a really low combined ratio. It's around 80. The bad news is in the current state would be to say that, well, when you're running at that level, you need to take rates now. I mean you can't sustain and even in some places, require you to refile your rates, you can't sustain that level that far below target combined ratios.  And National General, on the other hand, was still taking a maintenance level of rates up over that period of time. So now flash forward to today, their frequency down while all states is up. And then you've got a higher average earned premium going through.  And I mentioned before the $1.7 billion of premium that we have already in the system, not only filed but approved and already like renewing on policies that hasn't been earned yet, we've actually only earned 15% of the premium that's been raised through this cycle. So we get 85% of it out there still left to be earned, whereas National General is earning off of a base, plus they didn't have the hole to fill, so to speak, of the negative rates that, again, we appropriately took because when you're running an 80 combined ratio, but you got to fill that up to get back to par and then go up from there. So there's a difference in the average earned premium that's a few points to the differences, one.  Two, there's a few points difference on the frequency levels right now. Three, and this is a really important one when you're looking across companies is the risks are different and the policies are different. So as you think about the inflationary factors and how they're hitting different policies, National General, even inside their own book, it's really fascinating. If you look at their full coverage policies versus their liability-only policies, they're running about 10 points different on trend in their combined ratio. Because if you think about a liability-only policy, you don't have collision, which is the highest inflationary trend of any coverage right now, one. Two, you tend to have very low liability limits, so on things like, let's say, property damage. If you have a state minimum of $10,000 of property-liability coverage and you hit somebody's car and you total it, whether it's before the inflation factors that were hitting us or after, you're probably just going to pay that $10,000. And the inflation, there's a computation to that inflation. Whereas when you typically have $100,000 limits, you're bearing the full weight of the change in the value of vehicles.  So looking at all these components, we see just a lot of different ways, and I didn't even get into state mix, which is another one, a lot of different ways that the trends move differently. The nice thing is having acquired NatGen, and it's performing really well, it's growing nicely, it's profitable, is that it's really acting right now as a bit of a diversification on that auto trend and gives us a place where we are able and willing to grow. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Andrew Kligerman : Can you hear me this time? Thomas Wilson : We can. Andrew Kligerman : I'm sorry about that before. First question is around non-rate actions. Could you give a little color on some of the more material non-rate actions that you could take and the potential magnitude we might be able to see in the back half of the year on loss ratio? How much potential improvement could that offer? Thomas Wilson : Glenn can give you the items. I think we probably won't be able to give you an attribution on what that will do for this year's combined ratio. Glenn, what do you -- do you want to take that? Glenn Shapiro : Yes. So I'll give you a few like you've got underwriting actions where we segment the business and we segment our pricing to where, as Tom said earlier, it isn't just about, geez, we're going to not write new business in this market, let's say, it's, well, we're profitable in these segments and not those other ones. So we're going to change the segmentation of our pricing, would be one.  Another would be, we changed the down payment on policies and expect that there's a change in the flow of business at times with that. Certainly, the targeting of marketing is a really big one that I think can be underplayed, but we're pretty sophisticated in how we go to market. So when and where are we putting up banner ads when people are searching for auto insurance, which risk categories, which markets? And flat out, we've taken a lot of marketing dollars out right now. We're just reducing the marketing that we' re doing : one, it will improve expense; two, it will lower the new business flow and allow us to more quickly get back to profitability; and then the last one I'll say is the sales incentives that are out there with our agents about how we're incentivizing people to grow and in which places.  So when you put all of that together and you look at how you're going to market, you're really limiting in some places, the ability to grow your business with your intent of being not growing in nonprofitable segments. Andrew Kligerman : Got it. That's helpful. And I should assume then that, that would be a very material impact on loss ratio as we go into the back half of the year? Thomas Wilson : I don't think you should assume very material. I mean, the first, it's subject to anybody's -- underwriting actions, Andrew, won't get us to where we need to go. We need to raise prices, cut our expenses. Those are the big drivers. This is helpful. And I'd like to say to our team, look, anybody can give it away, so like there's no sense writing business and knowing you're going to lose money out whatever. So this is more about managing long-term profitability than what it would do for the combined ratio in the second half of the year. Andrew Kligerman : Got it. And then just looking backwards a little bit and a lot of your competitors that their rate increases have been all over the place, and I think you got what about 2.5% across the whole book last quarter. What was the thinking going into that? Why not a lot more rate? Was it precluded by the fact that 20% of the book is in California and New York, and it's a lot more difficult? But maybe just rewinding back a little bit, why not pushing for a lot more rate 4 or 5 months ago? Thomas Wilson : Well, I address part of that with the comparison of Progressive, but let me just address that first, the philosophical concept. We are raising prices as fast as we can, everywhere we can. So we're up 6.1% in 6 months of this year, which is -- would have been equal to maybe even our highest year in a long period of time. So we're -- and we expect to get at least that much in the second half. So there wasn't any thinking of let's dial down to 2.5%. It's let's get everything we can, everywhere we can. It obviously does depend on -- if you don't get anything in California, as Glenn said, that's 12% of your stuff of your total book, so that you got to pick it up by getting the right price in other places or just getting smaller in those places. So it doesn't impact your profitability as much.  As it relates to our competitors, I think, again, everyone's got their own story. We have our own story inside National General is different than the Allstate brand is -- it's related to Progressive. Their frequency was up about 10 -- almost 10 points more than ours in 2021. So you would expect them to raise their prices faster and higher than we did because at the beginning of the year, we were still earning a very attractive combined ratio.  So I think everyone has their own story. What I would leave you with is that like we're completely committed to getting a combined ratio consistent with where we've been in the past. We've been able to run our business for a long time in the mid-90s, and even when the industry has been a lot higher than that and we see no change in the competitive situation, the regulatory environment or our capabilities that lead us to conclude that, that's not possible. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Tracy Benguigui : I want to touch on your higher physical damage loss development, Slide 6. Just wondering, in your transformative growth initiative, I presume you cut clean staff. Do you feel like you're adequate staff in claims where you can close claims in a timely fashion? Maybe you could talk about how you're trying to speed up close rates? Thomas Wilson : Let me -- Glenn, if you'll talk about what we're doing in claims from an operating standpoint to deal with a higher inflationary environment, leveraging our relationships and getting purchase contracts, and then Mario can talk about the difference between property damage, which is amounts that we have to pay to other people for accidents that our customers help create to how we look at collision. And Tracy, the change in the prior year reserve stuff was really on that first category. And so Mario can talk about how that flows through the system. Glenn Shapiro : So yes. So I'll start with -- let me just emphatically say we are not behind on claims staff, and we are not behind on claims. Our pending looks good. And we're in good shape there. The expenses that we took out of the claims process, the team has done a really terrific job of automating processes, creating good self-service capabilities, using a lot of virtual estimating capability. With the slowdown we talked about in the system is really external, and everybody is dealing with this part of it. And this would be uniform across the industry.  So, for example, shop capacity is way down. The staffing level in body shops across the repair industry is down to the point where there's been a 33% decline in the number of hours worked per car per day. So you think about a car sitting in a shop and historically is 4 hours a day, it got work done, now it's 3 hours a day or a little less than 3 hours a day. So it's moved materially on that. Not surprisingly, the converse of that is that the average car time in a shop has doubled, and the average time to get a car into a shop has more than doubled. So you put all of those together and consumers are, frankly, just choosing to hold on to the check and wait to fix their drivable car until a time they think they can get it back in some reasonable time.  And so we're seeing a way elongated repair cycle that then you get your supplements later and you just have a different dynamic in the way the financials are coming through. And it's -- like I said in the prepared remarks, we had planned for it being about 40% greater than any point prior, and it turned out to be even higher than that with the way it delayed coming through. So I just didn't want the question to miss the chance to tell you, it is not claim staffing. We've got plenty of staff, and our team does a terrific job on it. Thomas Wilson : Well, in fact, Glenn, you're also doing some stuff and parts buying and other things that mitigate the inflationary aspects, right? Glenn Shapiro : Yes, absolutely. So using our scale as a company, we've doubled down on some of our parts suppliers, and this is both in home and auto, by the way, where we become a large and in some cases, the largest in the industry buyer of certain materials, whether it's parts in auto or roofing and homeowners or flooring, and we get the benefit of those broader relationships and trends.  We've also doubled down on our direct repair shop, network in auto, so that we can get our customers access to more shops that can take their car and we have a better one-to-one relationship with that network and are able to control costs in that way. Thomas Wilson : And Mario, why don't you talk about a reserve release piece? Mario Rizzo : Yes. So I guess -- just a couple of points I think are worth making before I jump into -- to that. First of all, at the end of any reporting period, we believe, based on our processes that our reserves are adequate. That's certainly the case at the end of the second quarter as we work our way what are very comprehensive and thorough processes to estimate reserves, taking into account all the data and inputs both in terms of internal and external data that we have. So I guess that's the place I'd start. Well, Tracy, your question was on physical damage development specifically, which is different than historically because these tend to be pretty short-tail claims in the past. And as Tom mentioned, they're really -- they show up principally in 2 coverages : collision and property damage.  Collision is first-party coverage. There are customers. We're fixing their cars. A claim gets reported, it's open. It may be subject to the same delays that Glenn talked about in terms of body shops, waiting periods, certainly the same inflationary factors. But we have the claim, we pay the claim, we move on.  Property damage is a third-party coverage. So just to remind you, it's another carrier's customer. And oftentimes, we get notice of that claim and the payout on that claim are subrogation demands we get from a third-party carrier. And what we've seen is, as Glenn talked about, lack of capacity and auto repair shops, coupled with the inflation factors we've been talking about as well as changes in consumer claiming behavior. A lot of consumers are waiting oftentimes months to get their cars repaired whether that's because they can't get in the queue or they can't get an appointment to get it repaired, but it's just taking longer.  And what that -- what all those factors are showing up as is a much longer tail and property damage on those third-party sub road demand from other carriers. And that is the physical damage strengthening that we reported in the quarter, much of that was in PD, and you see that on the chart that we showed on Page 6 of the presentation. In terms of the dollar amounts getting paid after the end of the calendar year are much more significant than we've seen in the past.  The thing I'd leave you with is because we have this information on kind of longer tail expectations, we're taking that into account as we establish 2022 severity levels. So we're certainly factoring that into the severity increases that we talked about earlier. Tracy Benguigui : So just a follow-up on that. Your auto underlying loss ratio of 79.6% was up 4.7 points sequentially. So should I think that part of that was raising your loss picks from everything you said, but was there also a component that you trued up your first quarter loss ratio since that will show up as a prior year, it's in the same accident year? Mario Rizzo : Yes, Tracy. So as you know, when we increased severity, which we did slightly this quarter relative to where we talked about our severity trends last quarter, that gets applied to claim counts for the entire year. So there is a catch-up component that would have been reflected in the first quarter, had we had perfect information in the first quarter. Tracy Benguigui : And would you be able to quantify what that first quarter true-up would have looked like, just so we have a better sense of what's the right starting point when thinking about your loss ratio? Thomas Wilson : Tracy, I think you should just think about looking at the combined ratio by quarter, it does bounce around. There's seasonality, there's driving in the summer, there's all kinds of stuff. So I would -- I think look at it on a year basis. We did it 1 year -- 1 quarter last year when it was a pretty big number. It's not that big as we're looking at this quarter. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Paul Newsome : I was wondering thinking about on the home insurance side of the house. Do we see the same sort of regulatory pressure in the home insurance business that we do in the auto because presumably, we have inflationary issues there and presumably, you need to get rate there as well to offset those issues? Thomas Wilson : Paul, the increase in home insurance, you saw is 15% year-over-year. So we don't -- we're getting the rates we think we need in those areas. The underlying assumption there is we have regulatory pressure in auto insurance. And as Glenn mentioned, we have good relationships with the regulation when the price of picking cars, they got it. So there are a few states. And so we've been waiting to get a rate increase that was agreed to with State of California over a year ago on homeowners, and that has yet to come through. So it tends to be more of a state-specific issue than a broad-based regulatory pushback. Glenn, anything you want to add? Glenn Shapiro : Yes. The only thing I would add there is it's that base level of premium we're getting that isn't great. It's the inflationary factors that really keeps us going in that space. It's just a different type of products. Home values go up, and replacement costs go up. Cars, other than recent history, tend to not go up. So it's a different type of product in that way.  So when you look at an average premium up over 13% year-over-year, it's a mix of rate in that. But to your point, Paul, like we've got to get rate there, it's not as heavy as it is in auto, but we deal with the same regulators.  And I always go back to, it's the math. Like we're not making up these rates, and they're not looking to make up a reason not to do the rates in most cases. It's the math. Does the math support a trend that says you need rate? And we've been successful in that space. Paul Newsome : No, I was just curious because obviously getting rate in home is different than auto is that inflation factors there and such. I just want to know if the dynamics is -- so really any different in the improvement of the rate there as well. And on the home side, is -- are you implementing some of the same underwriting criteria changes? Or are they materially different than what we've talked about from that volumes changes this quarter on the auto side? Thomas Wilson : Glenn, do you want to take that? Glenn Shapiro : Yes. No, we're -- I would say it is materially different. We like where we are in homeowners. That's obviously not universal. I mean, there's -- from a risk standpoint, from a catastrophe-prone standpoint, everything, there's obviously a lot of underwriting we do. It's one of the strengths we have. And homeowners is that we know how to underwrite this business to make money over time and protect a good balance set of customers in such a way that, that portfolio works.  But we are not in an equal or even that similar position in homeowners as auto right now in spite of the inflation. We're in a very good position to continue to write and grow homeowners. Thomas Wilson : Jonathan, let's just do 1 last question. Operator : Certainly. And our final question for today comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Joshua Shanker : When I think of Allstate, I think you guys are second to none understanding the long-term value bundler that the Progressive people call the Robinson. And when anyone says they're going after that Allstate customer, I'm very skeptical at the level of success they'll have. On the other hand, you guys bought NatGen to go into nonstandard in a bigger way. You guys have come back and forth over 20 years in that a number of times. And if you look at Progressive, they're losing their SAMs at this point in time. Whether they're unprofitable or whatnot, that they are going somewhere. And when you talk about having 1,000 basis points of better margin in NatGen and it's growing, how confident are you given that that's not your legacy business that you understand that those aren't Progressive customers that they can't make work coming onto your books? Thomas Wilson : Let me see if I can deal with that. So I'm going to go up in a minute. So it's really the question of we. And so who is we, Josh? So we as now Allstate and NatGen, as opposed to we was Allstate without experience in nonstandard.  So you may remember when we got started on NatGen, I went to Barry Karfunkel and said, hey, Barry, I got this problem, I'm not making any money in the independent agent business, and I'm not really in the nonstandard business. So I either have to get out of the business or try to fix it, I had trouble fixing it. So I've decided I'd like to get out of it, but I'm going to get out of it first by buying you, and then your team can fix our business, and that's exactly what's played out.  Peter Randell and that team are really good at nonstandard. They know their business well. They run separately. They have separate pricing, separate claims, they know that business well. And then they took our Encompass business, which was more a standard business, and they're folding that in.  And so we think we have a great opportunity to expand in the independent agent channel, not just for the nonstandard piece but in what's affectionately called, I guess, the Robinson is quite progressive because we're really in that segment. And we think there's a great opportunity for us to compete there. Joshua Shanker : And so I just -- I'll make this the last part of the question. You say who as we, and you're making it seeing that National General is running separately in some ways from Allstate. Of course, you're in charge and the buck stops with you, Tom, how comp are you that you understand the underwriting going on there that you know that what we see right now is results that you're very comfortable and proud of? Thomas Wilson : Yes. It's not that hard to understand, Josh. It's more difficult to build a set of business processes, policy documents, procedures and relationships with agents to note. So they -- for example, they were on something called the WAR Score where they look at every individual agent and see what kind of business they're getting for them. So it isn't -- like if it's got wheels on it, and it's got losses and that stuff is not that complicated. What's really complicated is building the business model to do it. And we are highly confident that they know what they're doing.  All right. First, as we move forward, we clearly, based on your comments and the amount of time, we're focused on auto insurance. We're going to get those margins up. We still got to make sure we make good money in homeowners, expand on our Protection services and at the same time, rebuild its digital insurer called transformer growth of that when we get margins where we are, we can hit the accelerator hard on profitable growth and drive more shareholder value.  So thank you all, and we'll talk to you on investments in September. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

After prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, please be aware that this call is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Mark Nogal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Nogal : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning and welcome to Allstate's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement filed our 10-Q and posted today's presentation on our website allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2021 and other public documents for information on potential risks. Additionally, we will be hosting our next special topic investor call on December 2, focusing on Allstate's auto and home insurance claims practices and reserving process. And now I'll turn it over to Tom. Thomas Wilson : Well, good morning. Thank you for investing your time with Allstate today. As you know, we pre-released earnings several weeks ago and reported the net loss for the quarter. That reflected a small underlying, underwriting margin that was offset by increases in reserves for prior years and a mark-to-market loss on public equity securities. . Mario and Jeff will go through the details of the quarter and the reserve changes after I set some context. So let's start on Slide 2. Allstate's strategy to increase shareholder value has two components : increase personal profit liability market share and expand protection services, which are shown in the two ovals on the left. We're building a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution through transfer onto growth to increase market share. We're also broadening protection offerings and leveraging the Allstate brand, customer base and capabilities with expanded distribution. In the third quarter, we made progress executing this strategy, while we continue to implement a comprehensive approach to improve auto profitability, which is shown in the right-hand panel, that includes broadly raising auto insurance rates, which you've seen in our disclosures. Operating expenses were lowered, including advertising and more permanent reductions in the operating cost structure. Underwriting guidelines have been adjusted to reduce new business volume where we're not earning adequate returns. Our claims operating processes are being modified to manage loss cost in a high inflation environment. And we believe this plan will return auto insurance profitability to historical levels. While the current environment requires focus on improving margins, we continue to advance and transform our growth strategy to gain market share when profitability improves. In addition, the protection services businesses is generating profitable growth. Investment returns were negative for the quarter and year-to-date, but better than the overall declines in the bond and equity markets. This reflects risk reductions implemented late last year. So you'll remember, we reduced the bond portfolio duration to lower exposure to high interest rates, which enabled us to avoid about $2 billion in losses in the bond portfolio. Our capital position is strong, and as a result, we were able to deliver attractive returns to shareholders. And Jess is going to discuss capital in his section, but let me provide a few summary points since this was covered in some of the reports issued last night. First, we have plenty of capital, and there's $4.5 billion of deployable capital at the holding. Secondly, the significant reduction in risk with the sale of the life and annuity operations occurred last October and that needs to be considered. This divestiture reduced assets by $34 billion and freed up capital. Thirdly, we use a really sophisticated approach to determining our capital that goes far beyond statutory capital and premium to surplus ratios. For example, if you just use statutory capital measure, the life company equity would be included in capital historically, which we did not believe was appropriate, so we never included it. So our methodology has led to strong results. We did decide to complete the remaining $1.4 billion stock repurchase over more than the next six months, which was our prior target we had disclosed to, but we still expect to complete it in the second or third quarter of next year. So in summary, we're really well capitalized, and this year's results have not changed our strategy or earnings power. Now let's move to Slide 3 to go through the third quarter performance in detail. Total revenues of $13.2 billion or 5.8% over the prior year quarter as property liability premiums earned increased by $5 billion or 9.8%, which reflected higher average premiums and policy growth. Lower net investment income and net losses on investments and derivatives negatively impacted the year-over-year considering our comparison there. A net loss of $694 million and an adjusted net loss of $420 million in the third quarter reflected a decline in underwriting income due to an increase in profit liability, prior year reserve estimates, which was $875 million that excludes catastrophes and increased loss costs in the current year. Looking forward, beyond improving profits in auto insurance, if you go to Slide 4, you'll see the flywheel of growth that will increase personal profit liability market share. So this is a multiyear initiative designed to build a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution, that will be accomplished by delivering on five key objectives : improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition, deploying new technology ecosystems and enhancing organizational capabilities. We made significant progress on all these components, and we're well on the way to having really being in a position where we can dial up growth quite rapidly when profitability improves. Now let me turn it over to Mario, and he'll go through our property-liability results. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Tom. Let's start by reviewing underwriting profitability for the Property Liability business in total on Slide 5. Our underwriting results reflect the high level of inflation and the impact of reserve strengthening in the quarter with a third quarter recorded combined ratio of 117.4% for auto, 91.2% for homeowners, 126.6% for all other lines and 111.6% for total property liability, which is shown on the left chart. Remember, our goal is to run the auto business with a combined ratio in the mid-90s and homeowners at around 90, while homeowners was close to our target in the quarter, we continue to focus on improving auto margins through a comprehensive plan that is being implemented to get us back to our mid-90s objective. The third quarter underlying combined ratio for auto insurance was 104, as you can see on the right. So we're raising auto insurance prices, reducing growth investments, lowering operating expenses and adapting claims practices to a high inflationary environment. While the homeowners business generated $245 million of underwriting profit, higher severity resulted in an underlying combined ratio of 74.6%, which is above where we manage it to, and we are increasing prices through both rates and the inflationary adjustment factor embedded in our homeowners product to improve underlying margins going forward. One of the reasons that we have an industry-leading homeowners business is because we proactively manage the risk and return profile of each market that we operate in. Based on this approach, we have decided to stop writing new homeowners and condo insurance in California at this time, given our inability to fully reflect the cost of providing these products in the state, including both loss and reinsurance costs. We intend to continue protecting our existing California property customers by offering ongoing coverage to them. Other lines are mainly traditional small commercial auto and shared economy insurance, both of which have recorded and underlying combined ratios above target levels. As a result, we made the decision to exit 5 states in the traditional small commercial business and no longer provide insurance to transportation network companies unless pricing begins to utilize a telematics-based framework for pricing. These actions are expected to reduce commercial business premiums by over 50% next year. Let's move to Slide 6 and discuss auto profitability in more detail. As you can see from the chart on the left, which shows the auto insurance combined ratio and underlying combined ratio over time. We have a long history of meeting or outperforming our mid- combined ratio target, supported by our pricing sophistication, underwriting and claims equities and expense management. 2020 is an outlier with much better than target results due to reduced accident frequency in the early stages of the pandemic. In 2021 and again this year, we have experienced both higher frequency than 2020 and the impacts of inflation, which have dramatically increased the cost to repair or replace cars and raise the cost of settling injury claims with third parties who are injured in accidents with our customers. In addition, this quarter, we strengthened prior year reserves by $643 million, which Jeff will discuss in more detail in a few minutes and experienced higher catastrophe losses mainly from flooding associated with Hurricane in. As a result, the auto insurance recorded combined ratio was 117.4% with reserve strengthening and catastrophes contributing 8.5 and 4.4 points, respectively, to this result. The right chart quantifies the drivers in the year-over-year change in the underlying combined ratio, which increased from 97.6 to 104 and excludes catastrophes and the reserve changes. The red bar reflects the increase in underlying losses, primarily due to current report year incurred severity strengthening across major coverages and moderately higher frequency than last year. The increase to underlying loss costs were partially offset by 4.3 points of average earned premiums from implemented rate increases and a 3.1 point reduction in underwriting expenses to get to the 104. To add more clarity to the current quarter results, we also highlight the 2.6 point impact of increasing full year claim severities in the third quarter for claims that were reported in the first and second quarter of this year. This impact is noted by the green bar on the right-hand chart. Excluding this intra-year strengthening, the third quarter underlying combined ratio would have been 101.4. Current report year incurred severity for collision and property damage claims were increased to 17% above the level reported for the full year 2021, and bodily injury severity was increased to 12%. Moving to Slide 7, let's discuss key components of our multifaceted plan to deal with inflation, raising auto insurance prices. Growth in average premium per policy is accelerating due to implemented rate increases over the last 12 months, but the impact to average earned premium per policy is on a lag due to the 6-month policy term. Over the last 12 months, we've implemented Allstate brand auto rate increases across 53 locations for an annualized written premium impact of approximately 13.7% or nearly $3.3 billion, including 4.7% in the third quarter. The chart on the page is an estimation of when the rate increases implemented in the last 12 months will be earned into premiums. This illustrative example assumes only 85% of the annualized written premium will be earned to account for retention and the fact that some customers modify policy terms, such as deductibles or limits when faced with price increases. As you can see, looking back at Q3 2022, the estimated impact of the $3.3 billion in annualized implemented rate had only an estimated impact of $660 million on earned premium, which is expected to grow by over $2.1 billion through the end of next year. Given the ongoing loss cost inflation, we expect to implement additional rate increases in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2023, and those will be on top of increases implemented since Q4 of last year and additive to the increases shown here. Moving to Slide 8, let's discuss the timing of how these rate increases will impact the combined ratio for auto insurance. The chart on this page is an illustrative view to show our path to target profitability, along with the magnitude of actions already taken and required prospectively. Starting on the left, through the first nine months of the year, the auto insurance recorded combined ratio is 109.3% as shown by the first blue bar. From this starting point, we removed the impact of prior year reserve increases and normalize the catastrophe loss ratio to our 5-year historical average. This improves the combined ratio by approximately 6 points represented by the first green bar. The second green bar reflects the estimated impact of rate actions already implemented when fully earned in the premium which is an additional $2.3 billion of premium across the Allstate and National General brands or approximately 8 points. These amounts will be mostly earned by the end of 2023. Of course, loss costs will likely continue to increase, whether from inflationary impacts on severity or higher accident frequency, which would increase the combined ratio. Prospective rate increases must meet or exceed loss cost increases to achieve historical returns. Combined with other non-rate actions such as reducing new business and expenses, we expect to achieve an auto insurance combined ratio target in the mid-90s. The timing of reaching this goal will be largely dependent on the relative increase in premiums and future loss cost trends. Moving to Slide 9. Let's now take a look at our industry-leading homeowners business. As you know, a significant portion of our customers bundle home and auto insurance, which improves retention and the overall economics of both product lines. We have a differentiated homeowners product, underwriting, reinsurance and claims ecosystem that is unique in the industry. Our long-term under result -- underwriting results reflect this dynamic with a 5-year average recorded combined ratio of 91.9%. The third quarter combined ratio for homeowners improved to 91.2%, primarily driven by lower catastrophe losses compared to the prior year quarter, as you can see by the chart on the left. Enterprise risk and return management actions reduced our Florida personal property market share to 2.6%, which, combined with a comprehensive reinsurance program, including our stand-alone Florida property coverage, significantly mitigated net losses from Hurricane Ian. Estimated gross catastrophe losses due to the hurricane totaled $671 million and were reduced by $305 million in expected reinsurance recoveries, primarily related to property reinsurance for our stand-alone Florida property insurance company, . Of the $366 million net loss from Ian, only approximately 25% was from property lines. Homeowners insurance is certainly not immune to the rising inflationary environment as we continue to be impacted by increasing labor and material costs. In the third quarter, non-catastrophe prior year reserves were strengthened by $51 million, and current report year incurred severity was increased primarily as a result of increasing inflation in both labor and material costs. The resulting impact to the underlying combined ratio from current year severity strengthening was 3.8 points in the third quarter, partially offset by slightly lower non-catastrophe frequency. Similar to auto insurance, there was an intra-year impact of 2.4 points related to claims reported in the first and second quarter of this year, which was reflected in the underlying combined ratio for the third quarter of 2022. To combat inflation challenges, our products have sophisticated pricing features that respond to changes in replacement values. The chart on the right shows key homeowners insurance operating statistics. Net written premium has grown sharply throughout 2021 and into 2022, increasing 9.4% from the prior year quarter and 12.9% year-to-date, primarily driven by a more than 13% increase in Allstate brand average gross premium per policy and a 1.4% increase in policies in force. The Allstate brand increases are partially offset by lower National General premiums and policies in force as we improve underwriting margins to targeted levels in this brand. We are continuing to raise homeowners' prices to address inflationary pressures, both through the impact of inflation on insured home valuations and filed rate increases. Beyond these pricing actions, we have also decided to limit new business where margin targets cannot be achieved in the near term, including the action I previously noted of suspending the sale of new homeowners insurance policies to consumers in California. Let's delve deeper into improving customer value through expense reductions on Slide 10. Let me start by saying we remain on pace and committed to our long-term objective to reduce our adjusted expense ratio which is a metric we introduced about a year ago to track our underlying progress to improve customer value. This metric starts with our underwriting expense ratio, excluding things like restructuring, coronavirus-related expenses amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and investments in advertising. It then adds in our claims expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims because catastrophe-related costs tend to bounce around quarter-to-quarter. Through innovation and strong execution, we've achieved almost three points of improvement since 2018. Over time, we expect to drive more than three points of additional improvements from current levels, achieving an adjusted expense ratio of approximately 23 by year-end 2024, and which represents a 6-point reduction compared to 2018. The chart on the slide shows the Allstate Protection underwriting expense ratio since 2018 and quantifies the impacts from third quarter 2022 compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting actions we've taken to address the current operating environment. The first green bar on the left shows the decline in advertising spend as growth investments have been reduced given our focus on improving margins. The next green bar shows a decline in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, primarily driven by the phaseout of enhanced compensation models for new agents. Our future cost reduction efforts are focused on digitization, sourcing and operating efficiency and continuing to reduce distribution costs. Let me now turn it over to Jess to discuss our reserving actions in the quarter and the remainder of our business results in more detail. Jess Merten : Thank you, Mario, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 11, let's begin with our prior year reserve development, property liability, prior year reserve strengthening, excluding catastrophes totaled $875 million in the third quarter. The pie chart on the left breaks down the impact by line with $643 million, driven by personal auto, $120 million one-off property liability from our annual reserve review related to environmental and asbestos exposures, $63 million in commercial, largely related to auto bodily injury and $51 million in homeowners. . The chart on the right breaks down Allstate Protection auto prior year reserve strengthening of $643 million in the third quarter, which was primarily driven by noncustomer claim and bodily injury claims. The total cost to settle these claims continues to be impacted by more severe accidents and higher medical and litigation costs. Increases to commercial and homeowners insurance can also be attributed to these factors. Physical damage prior year reserve increases in the third quarter from property damage collision and comprehensive coverages, excluding catastrophes, were largely offset by higher subrogation collection estimates. Now let's move to Slide 12 to discuss the drivers of bodily injury development and our claims operating actions to manage loss costs. Bodily injury severities have increased as the mix of claims shifted to more costly claim segments. The chart on the left shows the relative severity of bodily injury claims by type of treatment, major versus non-major and whether the claim is unrepresented, attorney represented or litigated. Major injuries have more expensive medical treatments, greater nonmedical related damages and often more attorney involvement. As a result, paid severity for major injury claims and litigation represented by the first bar on the left costs approximately 3.9x the average paid bodily injury claim. Non-major claims shown on the right-hand side of the chart, have less medical and other related costs intend not to have attorney costs, so unrepresented nonmajor injury claims are roughly 10% of the average cost. Let me be clear, in all cases, we settled the cases for what is fair and equitable regardless of attorney involvement. The table below the chart shows a significant shift from nonmajor claims that have below average cost to major injuries that are represented or in litigation in comparison to historical levels. This shift is partially attributable to more severe accidents. This shift to larger and more complex cases has also resulted in greater variability in paid and case reserve development patterns. As part of our actuarial process, we review changes in claim development patterns to define an appropriate range of estimated outcomes based on weighing historical and more recent trends in the data. The chart on the right side depicts the value of two standard deviations to the average paid in case severity development over the last six report years. As you can see, this measure of variability has almost doubled over the last two years, resulting in a wider range of estimated outcomes. The third quarter reserving process showed a continuation of these development patterns. Therefore, we increased reserves for prior years to reflect the persistence of the trends in major injuries, increased settlement costs and greater variability in case reserves. We're proactively responding to these trends by leveraging sophisticated models, increasing medical expertise, reviewing settlement processes and assessing litigation risks. Now let's move to Slide 13 and briefly discuss physical damage loss costs, which continue to pressure profitability. Rising inflation and delays in third-party carriers subrogation demands are driving higher expected severity in the property damage coverage leading to an increase in the current year -- the current report year variance from 12% to 17% when compared to 2021. The left side of the slide includes a chart we have shown before, which indexes inflation to year-end 2018 for a few of the main inputs to physical damage severity. While used car values are below their recent peak, which is a positive indicator to continue to run more than 50% above pre-pandemic levels. Conversely, labor and parts prices continue to accelerate from the prior peak levels seen just last quarter. This continues to put upward pressure on severities in the near term. The right-hand side of the page shows third-party subrogation demand dollars paid, again, indexed to the year-end 2018. Third-party demands are when our insured isn't an accident and the claimant files a claim to their carrier rather than us. As the other carrier evaluates the claim, the Allstate insured is wholly or partially at fault, they will reach out to us with subrogation demand. We have recently experienced an uptick in the volume of severity -- volume and severity of these demands compared to prior year trends and expectations. It's worth noting that a similar dynamic is also impacting our first-party collision coverages. We are demanding and receiving elevated subrogation collections from other carriers following the declines during the pandemic and backlog and claim settlements due to delayed repairs. Shifting gears now on Slide 14. The Protection Services businesses in the lower strategic growing revenues and increasing shareholder value as we invest in future expansion. Revenues, excluding the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives increased 7.2% to $640 million in the quarter, primarily driven by a 12.2% increase in Allstate Protection Plans. Adjusted net income of $35 million for the third quarter of 2022 decreased $10 million compared to the prior year quarter due to increased severity on appliance repair for Allstate protection plans, in the absence of onetime restructuring expense at Allstate Identity Protection in the prior year quarter as well as investments in growth. Policies in force declined 5%, reflecting the expiration of protection plan warranties primarily due to the -- to a high volume, low premium per policy retail account and overall decline in retail sales. Moving now to Slide 15. Allstate Health and Benefits is also growing an attractive set of businesses that protect millions of policyholders. The acquisition of National General in 2021 added both group and individual health products to our portfolio, as you can see on the left. Revenues of $570 million in the third quarter of 2022 increased 1.2% to the prior year quarter as growth in group health and employer voluntary benefits was partially offset by a reduction in individual health. Adjusted net income of $54 million increased $21 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting a lower benefit ratio, lower restructuring charges and increased revenue. Shifting now to investments on Slide 16. We'll review the performance and the portfolio risk and return position that we've taken given higher inflation and the possibility of a recession. As you may recall, we reduced our portfolio risk beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021. This included shortening the fixed income duration from 4.6 years to three years through the sale of bonds and use of derivatives, which resulted in a reduction to the portfolio's sensitivity to higher interest rates caused by increasing inflation. We also reduced our exposure to recession-sensitive assets through the sales of high-yield bonds, bank loans and public equity. We maintained this defensive positioning in the third quarter, which continued to preserve portfolio value given ongoing market volatility, rising interest rates and a further decline in public equity markets. As shown in the table, at the bottom left, our total return for the quarter was negative 0.8% and year-to-date is negative 6.4%, while adverse market conditions negatively impacted the portfolio, we estimate our duration shortening mitigated portfolio losses of approximately $2 billion. These proactive actions and the broad diversification of our portfolio produced results that were better than the S&P 500 index which is down 23.9% this year and the Bloomberg Intermediate corporate bond index, which has declined 11.8%. Our net investment income, shown in the chart on the left, totaled $690 million in the quarter, which was $74 million below the third quarter of last year. Performance-based income of $335 million shown in dark blue, was $102 million below a strong quarter in 2021. Three individual investments generated approximately 97% of the performance-based investment income in the quarter, including two sizable cash realizations. Excluding those assets, results of the broader performance-based portfolio were largely flat with negative valuations in our private equity fund investments, which have a higher correlation to public equity markets, offset by increased valuations on other asset classes such as real estate and infrastructure. Our market-based income, which is shown in blue, was $50 million above the prior year quarter, benefiting from reinvestment into market yields that are significantly higher than the overall portfolio's current yield. The table on the right demonstrates how our shorter duration fixed income portfolio is positioned to generate higher levels of investment income as we reinvest into higher interest rates. Our fixed income yield has begun to rise and was 2.9% at quarter end, but is well below the current intermediate corporate bond yield of 5.6%. Now let's take a few minutes to discuss Allstate's financial condition and capital position, starting with Slide 17. Allstate's corporate organizational structure provides sources of capital to the holding company from multiple reporting entities and intermediate holding companies. We manage capital at all levels using economic capital, rating agency models and regulatory requirements to guide decisions and maximize flexibility. We commonly report a view of capital that includes both statutory surplus and parent company -- parent holding company assets. We prefer to dividend money up from subsidiaries to the holding company when possible as it provides more financial flexibility for the organization while maintaining adequate capital levels from subsidiaries to support operations. The chart on the left shows an overview of our capital position since 2016. As you can see, it grew substantially beginning in 2019 following strong results leading up to and during the pandemic. While the current level of $19.8 billion is approximately $6 billion lower than a year ago, this was largely made up of two specific items. First, $3 billion or roughly half is related to the sale of the Life and Annuity business, as represented by the first red bar on the chart. This transaction reduced our statutory capital as we sold the legal entities and significantly reduced our overall risk profile, freeing up an additional $1.7 billion of capital. We returned this capital to shareholders as part of the current $5 billion share repurchase authorization. The second bar reflects our cash returns to shareholders, excluding the impact of the life and annuity sale. Together, these factors reduced capital by $5.4 billion with more than $4 billion going back to shareholders. The last red bar primarily reflects the impact of current auto insurance profitability challenges, which have resulted in a statutory loss and then changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity investments due to recent market volatility. We also added a line to this chart that represents our average capital from year-end 2016 through Q3 of 2021, excluding surplus related to the life and annuity businesses. Our current capital position of $19.8 billion is approximately $1 billion higher than this average, demonstrating that returning cash to shareholders after adjusting our risk profile in recent years of profitability has left us in a strong capital position. The right-hand side of this page isolates holding company assets, a key component of our capital relative to the remaining authorized repurchases and fixed charges. At the end of the third quarter, we had $4.5 billion in holding company assets with $1.2 billion remaining on the current share repurchase authorization, we would still have $3.3 billion remaining in comparison to our annual fixed charges of $1.3 billion. We believe holding company assets and capital resources available from statutory operating companies provide significant financial flexibility as we continue to implement profit improvement actions and invest in transformative growth. Now let's move to Slide 18 to discuss Allstate's strong cash return to shareholders. Adjusted net income return on equity of 4.3% was below the prior year, primarily due to lower underwriting income. Achieving our targeted combined ratios for auto and homeowners insurance will bring adjusted net income returns on equity back to our long-term targeted range of 14% to 17%. Through the first three quarters of 2022, we've returned $2.8 billion to shareholders through $2.1 billion in share repurchases and $698 million in common shareholder dividends. Over the last year, shares outstanding have been reduced by 7.7%, providing more upside per share as profitability has improved. There's $1.2 billion remaining on the current $5 billion share repurchase authorization as of September 30, which we expect to be completed in the second or third quarter of 2023 and as we moderately slow the pace of our repurchases. With that context, we're going to open up the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond. Charles Peters : I'm going to focus the first question on reserves. And I was looking at the information you provided on Slide 12 and some of the earlier slides. And I guess what we're trying to do is reconcile the charge that you took in the third quarter with the information we're getting from some of your peers? And then additionally, trying to understand why the data that you're showing now here for the third quarter results, so you can start to see it in the second quarter and make adjustments then. And I mean it's a long-winded question, but ultimately, we're trying to get at is there a risk of additional reserve charges going forward? Thomas Wilson : Greg, thank you for your question. Let me provide just a quick overview, and then Jesse can give you some more specifics. First, of course, obviously, we estimate the what's going to happen that depends on trends for the numbers. And we can't make a comment as to what other people's numbers look. People do reserving all sorts of different ways. And we believe ours is highly precise, specific, and we have external people look at it, and we put up the numbers when we think we need to put them up. And of course, this quarter, we did increase it for prior years and that's largely due to the injury trends that just saw, which have really been unfolding over the last couple of years. And these are claims that take 4 years before you get 80% paid. It takes a while before it developed. Jesse what would -- how do you want to address that? Jess Merten : Yes. Thanks, Tom. Greg, what I would start with is, I think it's important to be clear on one thing. At the end of every quarter, we record reserves at an appropriate level based on all the information that we have in front of us. We did that at the end of Q3 and every quarter leading up to Q3. We followed the same process that we have in the past. It's a rigorous process. It leverages internal actuarial expertise, close collaboration with our claims team and third-party reviews to analyze the most current data and assess the impact on that data on our reserves. . As I look at the quarter, the variability that we've seen continue to come through in the data that we reviewed as part of our actual process. So Q3 data supported more recent trends and continued variability in reserve development. And while these trends weren't new, an additional quarter of data did provide new insights into the persistent nature of the trends that have been emerging. So insights from actual claims development in the quarter, led us to strengthen both prior year reserves and increase our report year 2022 ultimate severities. So as I take a step back and think about where we're at from a reserve perspective, we record appropriate reserves based on what we know at the time. We used current data and all known factors to establish the reserves. So I'm confident in what we set up. And I think that the new insights that we cleaned in Q3 caused us to make the move. Charles Peters : Okay, makes sense. I guess my follow-up question is on capital. And just looking at it from a macro perspective, I really don't remember in recent history, a time where you guys have been growing your top line almost at a double-digit rate. And that by itself puts pressure on capital resources. And then if we look at your capital position outlined in the statistical supplement, and we see total capital resources having declined year-over-year due to a variety of issues. Just wondering if you can help frame how we should think about traditional metrics around premiums to surplus in the context of all the different moving parts? Thomas Wilson : I'll start and then Jesse can add as well. So Greg, first, we don't use the traditional -- when we look at the traditional metrics like premium surplus and as we go, but we're much more sophisticated than that. And it goes -- in the way we allocate capital is from an enterprise standpoint and looks at specificity on risk levels down to the state-based level by line. So for example, some people would blend their premium to surplus ratio for all property liability products, auto and home at the same. We don't do that. We think capital is much higher for homeowners insurance. And that's why when Mario went through our target ratios for home insurance, they're lower than they are for auto insurance. Other people just assume that same. So we're much -- we're very sophisticated in the way we do it. We manage it from an enterprise standpoint. So when we -- the answer would be we have plenty of capital, like we've got tons of money, and it's not going to do anything to our strategy. It has no impact on our future earnings power, which is, of course, what drives the company. And we're in the middle of a massive share repurchase program, and we don't feel like we have to back off on it based on what we know about our business at the granular level. So we feel very good about where we're at. We've generated good returns for shareholders by doing it that way. And so there's really -- I feel like using broad measures like that doesn't really reflect the economic reality that we're managing to. Jesse, where would you go from there? Jess Merten : That's a pretty complete answer, Tom. But I think the important point is that the proactive capital management that really relies on our robust economic capital approach, which looks at risk on a granular basis and takes that information to understand capital needs in an enterprise level. Premium surplus only looks at one dimension of risk and capital, and we use a more complete set of measures and metrics to establish capital levels, as Tom laid out. So I just think it's important. We're cognizant of and we monitor regulatory capital requirements, rating agency capital benchmarks, all in our proactive capital management process. But I feel the same way that Tom does it that we certainly have plenty of money to execute on our strategies and continue to implement our profit improvement plan. So nothing more to add, Tom. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question is on the capital side of things. So as you guys came to the decision, I guess, to more moderate your buyback, are you assuming that there's any dividends that you're going to take out of Allstate Insurance company over the next year? And then within that question, I guess, did you guys think about pausing the buyback program completely just to have more capital flexibility within that subsidiary? Thomas Wilson : Elyse, let me answer that and Jesse can jump in. First, in terms of the dividends, we move -- first, we make sure that each of the insurance subsidiaries that large ones are appropriately capitalized based on what we think economic capital is just that with the rating agencies, whether it's an investor, others, think we should have in those and then what regulators want. So -- and we're really well capitalized at those. To the extent there is extra capital in those, we then move that out of the insurance companies into the holding company is just point out because that gives us more flexibility. As we look forward next year, it will depend how much money we make. I think in some of the announcements, like we have really strong earnings power and when you look at our profitability of our auto insurance, we think it's headed up. So we think there's plenty of earnings power. Whether that and where we think risk is and what we need to do with risk will depend on the overall enterprise risk portfolio. So for example, not covered in some of these things, we dialled down the risk for our investment portfolio late last year as a percentage of our total enterprise capital because we didn't think it was a good risk return trade-off. So we're constantly managing where do we want to move capital where do we want to make sure we get a good return on it. So we don't feel like we are capital constrained at all. Did we consider shutting the program down in total? No. We think we have plenty of moments of $5 billion of massive share repurchase program, a large 4 of which a portion of which was funded because we sold the life insurance company. and we said we should get that money back to the cat shareholders. So we have a historical track record of doing this extremely well. We're a top decile amongst the S&P of providing cash returns to shareholders. And we do that without putting our customers at risk of the company is. So we feel like we're in really good shape. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then my follow-up, I guess, would be right. You talked about that you don't manage your premium to surplus, but I know one of your peers has mentioned looking to write their all business to a 3 :1 home to 1.5:1. So I'm not sure if you have frames of references that you look at for your businesses? And then if rating agencies and regulators, what are they looking at? Are they holding you to a 3 :1? Or is there other metrics that they're holding you to relative to premium to surplus or something else? Thomas Wilson : We've had -- essentially to say, from certainly my standpoint, no conversations with regulators about our cap levels because we're so well capitalized -- I might start there. And that's been true forever and it will be true far into the future. And so the regulators really were so far above their standards. It's not really been a conversation. I can't speak to how other people look at their premium surplus ratio. I think some of our competitors who don't make money in homeowners should have even more than we do. Because when you look at your capital it's -- okay, what do we think the risk is? What is the risk of loss. But you also want to factor in your earnings power. And so if you're losing $0.10 on a dollar, on a line of business, then you have to hold more capital than if you're making $0.10 on the line of business. So I think it's all very idiosyncratic to a specific company. . We factor all of those things in by state really and even sometimes looking down at different components of the state to decide what price we should get per customer from customers, how much business we want to write and then how much capital we have to keep in the company. So I feel very good about where we're at. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Brian Meredith : A couple of them here for you. First, Tom, I'm just curious, this is the, I think, first quarter a little while that we've seen auto PIF actually declined somewhat sequentially. Is that due to some of the actions you're taking in California? Or is it just in general, the price increases you're taking should we expect the PIFs to kind of decline here for a couple of quarters. Thomas Wilson : Well, the PIF decline was, of course, in the Allstate brand versus in total because we went up in the independent agent channel, but it's intentional. And I would tell you that it's actually the decline was less than we thought it would be. When you look at historical price sensitivities on what your customer retention is, our retention is held up better than you would think from historical trends. It's hard to do attribution down to the specific item, but when you look at it, we'd say, first, the competitive position -- our competitors are also raising rates. So as we raise rates, we thought more people would leave, but less did. It could be because our competitors are also raising rates. Consumers still have a fair amount of cash in their bank accounts, so that helps. They also know that their houses and cars are worth more. So it makes sense to them that they should have to pay more for insurance, when explained to them. And I think that's the value of our Allstate agents at this point. they're out working hard to make sure our customers understand why the prices are going up. And then as Mario mentioned, they'll help them work to figure out how do they get the right price. So this is a case where like our mile-wise product is really helpful for people because if you're, say your senior citizen, you don't drive much and you should go to Milewise and save a bunch of money by not paying more. So when you look through all those together, we expected our auto PIF to go down more in the Allstate brand than it did. But we're happy that we're keeping the customers because with the price increases we've put through that will be good shareholder value creation when we start earning the rates. Brian Meredith : Great. That's helpful. And then my next question, I'm just curious, and I think this question will be asked in prior quarters, but when you're pricing your auto insurance and homeowners insurance now, what type of loss trend are you expecting in the future expecting inflationary trends to moderate here? Or do you think they're going to stay relatively high here for a while? Thomas Wilson : Mario, will you take that? Mario Rizzo : Yes, sure. Brian. Yes, I think, Brian, in terms of what we're seeing, we're factoring in, obviously, the inflation we're experiencing currently, but also projecting it going forward so that we can reflect the full cost of loss costs prospectively into our prices. And so yes, we're not making any kind of significant assumptions around a deceleration in inflation going forward given the current inflationary environment, that's why we made the statement that we expect to continue to take rate increases certainly for the balance of this year but into next year, and that's really a reflection of the environment we're operating right now and the continued elevated level of inflation, which we need to kind of catch up with and then surpass going forward. So we're not assuming, as I said, any significant reduction in inflationary trends going forward. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Tracy Benguigui : All right. So used ask this question for casualty line writers. Given the consecutive adverse reserve development charges, have you worked with any external actuaries to review reserves? And if so, what is your management estimate relative to central estimates? Thomas Wilson : Tracy, we always work with external people and looking at our reserves. So we obviously have Deloitte & Touche to our auditors, but we also have an external actuary in called -- which is KPMG, which provides the statutory reports for our regulators. We look at all of their stuff. We just had a detailed review with Deloitte & Touche a couple of weeks ago, and their view ties closely to ours. . Tracy Benguigui : Do you have a management estimate above the central estimate at the moment? Or is it closer to the central? Thomas Wilson : We don't put ranges in the financials. We put up what we -- as Jesse said, like we put up what we think the future liability is and we pick a number, and that's where we do it. And we're comfortable with the number and that number is very close to what our external participants or external health thinks and thought historically, by the way. So it isn't like we were in -- we built a very similar views at the end of the second quarter, end of the first quarter and end of the third quarter, and they are -- they believe that the actions we've taken are appropriate. Tracy Benguigui : Got it. And just going back to capital management, given you manage capital more efficiently at the OpCo level and the way you like to hold cash at the holdco level if you could flex that up and down. I'm just curious, when was the last time you downstream capital to the operating company. How do you lever often. Thomas Wilson : It's a good question. I don't remember certainly in the last decade, I don't remember having done that at all from -- down to the Allstate insurance company. Would we move money into the health and benefits companies because they were growing or do we have to -- so we do move money around. But if you said if you really talk about Allstate insurance company as the largest business we have, I don't remember anything in the last 10 years. But Jesse or Mario, do you have any other perspective on that? Jess Merten : I don't have anything more than that. I think we did move some capital down into the Life company. at 1 point, Tom. But I think that certainly is no longer an issue, but that's the last thing that I remember. Mario? . Mario Rizzo : Yes, I would concur the last time I remember any meaningful movement of capital down into an operating company. would have been during the financial crisis, which obviously was a while ago. But as Tom mentioned, we moved capital around but nothing in terms of shortfalls within any of the insurance companies. Tracy Benguigui : Right. but I'm not thinking about this the right way where you have capital at the parent company that you could flex it up and down in your slide when you talk about your fixed charges, is there a multiple that you want to keep like 2x minimum level? Thomas Wilson : We don't manage it that way. I just showed the level of cash we would have after we used deployable capital to finish the share repurchase program, you can see it's still well above our fixed charges, which we intentionally managed to keep at a modest level, which is even though we increased the dividend by about 50% a year ago, we tried to give a lot of money back to shareholders through share repurchases. So we don't have a multiple -- if you had a multiple and you also have to factor in how much money you're going to make over the next 12 months. And obviously, our fixed charge coverages historically have been terrific. So we don't have a -- like don't go below this because we've never even been close. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : I think it was Jesse, who spoke about just the mix shift that you're experiencing on the BI claims side to more expensive claims. And as part of the reserving process, you weight both historical and more recent trends in the claim development patterns in the data. So I guess I'm wondering after the changes that you've made this quarter, are you -- I guess, how much are you waiting more recent experience? Is it 100% weight on these trends that you're seeing? Or is there still some weight being placed on more historical experience? Thomas Wilson : David, let me answer that, and Jesse, you can add anything else to it. So first, the reserving process uses all types of statistical analysis, triangles, link ratios, all sorts of different things. So there's no real like just 1 percentage. I think we look at it by state, by line of business, by coverage. And so it's slice and dice a whole bunch of way. So there's no really simple way to answer that. I think what I would say about you're trying to get comfortable with the reserves. It really starts -- you got to go back to say, well, what's happening in the world. And during the pandemic, we noticed when people weren't on the roads, people were driving a lot faster because there is -- they could zip around and there was no traffic and off they went. Once we get through the pandemic, at least in our data, we see people still driving pretty fast, but as a result of that, you have more severe accidents, and that trend appears to be holding. We thought that, that trend might come down because when the little ones are sort of bumps in scratches and stuff, which happen in congested traffic. Today, those, as you saw from Jesse's numbers have not gone back up and the major ones have not gone down. So people are just driving faster and hurting people more. So you have to figure out, okay, well, what are you going to do take care of it. Those are really complicated cases. I mean people have surgery, they have all kinds of services, and those services are more expensive, and they take longer to develop. So if you really severely injured, it could take 6 months, nine months, two years before you really figure out how you get back to where you should be, and it costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time. And so those cases develop over a longer period of time. So it isn't so much that it's just -- we use the same process as procedures, but as these things develop, it really comes back to -- our customers are just in a lot more severe actions and people are getting hurt, and we need to make sure we have the liability up to cover that. And that's what we did this quarter. So we said, okay, this is really continuing. Most of these are still severe. And as they develop, then you have to put the money up. David Motemaden : Got it. Okay. So it sounds like you had assumed that the mix which normalize somewhat away from some of these more severe accidents, and I guess now the assumption is that there is going to be no mix away from these more severe accidents and that's sort of the new normal. Is that correct? Thomas Wilson : Yes. But it's not just 1 item, I would say. So you can't pin it on just those now more majors. There's more majors. The majors are harder to estimate. They're taking longer to settle. There's more legal costs associated with settling those, and so you have to factor that in. So there's a whole bunch of factors that relate to it. So we look at it. We're comfortable we've put up the right amount of money. And what other companies do and what they're reserving are -- some people use less specific processes that we do, some processes react faster or slower to trends in the marketplace. But the important thing is we use the same process is have external views, and we all think this is the right amount of money. David Motemaden : Got it. Okay. And then maybe just a quick numbers follow-up here. So see that you guys are now assuming a bodily injury severity of 12%, I guess I'm just wondering what was the report year incurred severity on bodily injury for 2021 after the changes that you've made? Thomas Wilson : We have not broken out the reserve -- after the reserve changes by prior years. We won't break those out until we publish the 10-K. I mean, is that right -- correct, Jess? Jess Merten : That's right, Tom. We don't disclose the split, so we don't have that. Thomas Wilson : But suffice it to say, David, that is higher than it was before. David Motemaden : Yes. I was looking at a -- I'm just trying to get a sense for the compound if we say, okay, up 12%, but the base does matter. And so I think the base was set at 5% in the first quarter for all of 2021, which has since been changed. So I was just trying to get a sense for where that's gone. But I guess I'll look in the K for that. Thomas Wilson : Why don't we take 1 more question and then... Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Yaron Kinar : I'm going to go to my specialty of beating dead horses here, if I can. On capital, do you expect to deploy some of the hold liquidity into AIC over the coming year? Thomas Wilson : No. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And then shifting more just to the auto and home side. So I think you guys shifted the exclusive agent comp structure to be more weighted to new business. Now that you're kind of maybe taking a little bit of a step back on growth and really focusing more on fixing the margins, how is that playing out with the agent comp structure with your conversations with them? I'm assuming that can be a little bit of murmurings and rumblings around that. How are you handling that? Thomas Wilson : Well, I'm address embedded in all of this, there's a lot of good news on transformative growth that we really don't have a chance to talk about it. One is that which you talked about, which was expanding customer access is the second key lever. And that included selling direct under the Allstate brand at 7% less than it was sold through Allstate agents. And there was some concern amongst investors as to would the agents walk away and would you have a decline in volume there? And the answer is no. That is the underlying assumption that they would continue to be focused on getting more new customers given what we did to the compensation plan was true. . If you look at new business from the Allstate agents, you can see that's where it was a year ago, even though there are fewer Allstate agents out there. And then if you look at the retention numbers, as I mentioned, I think our agents are doing a great job for us talking to customers whose price changes. And so we feel good that, that part of the expanding access, all of our underlying assumptions prove to. We also have really improved our web-based and the call center close processes. So we're getting much better at selling through those two vehicles. We obviously dialled the advertising way down this year because we don't want to take on new business and then have to raise the price 15% or 20% the first time. So while you don't see the benefit of those improved processes come through new business, but when we get auto profitability improved, we feel good about the underlying assumptions we made in transformative growth and our progress in making those realities. So we're feeling good about where that's headed. Thomas Wilson : So thank you all for dialing in. As we move forward, we have a couple of things in front of us. One, we have to improve auto insurance margins, while making sure we continue to invest and transform the growth so that we can grow market share and then continuing to expand our other protection services businesses, which also had a great quarter. So thank you and we will talk to you in December. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect at today's conference.",

After the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, please be aware that this call is being recorded. And now I\u2019d like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Mr. Mark Nogal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Nogal : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we\u2019ll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted related material on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate\u2019s operations. Allstate\u2019s results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2021 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Well, good morning. Thank you for investing your time in Allstate today. I\u2019ll start by setting context and then Mario and Jess would provide additional perspective on operating results and the actions being taken to improve auto profitability and increase shareholder value. So let\u2019s begin on Slide 2. So as you know, Allstate strategy has two components : increase personal Property-Liability market share and expand Protection Services, which is shown in the two ovals on the left. On the right hand side, you can see our results for the year. Earnings were disappointing with a net loss of $1.4 billion, largely reflecting an underwriting loss on auto insurance and mark-to-market losses on the equity portfolio. Strong results from homeowners insurance, protection services and fixed income investments were not enough to offset the losses on auto and commercial insurance. The most important driver of near-term shareholder value will be successfully executing our comprehensive plan to improve auto profitability. That includes broadly raising auto insurance rates, reducing expenses including temporary moves such as less advertising and permanent reductions including digitizing and outsourcing work and lowering distribution costs. Underwriting restrictions have been implemented to reduce new business volume until profitability is acceptable. Claims operating processes are also being modified to manage our loss costs. This plan is being implemented, but earned premiums from auto insurance rates have not increased enough to offset higher loss costs. And while the number one priority is to improve auto insurance margins, implementation of the transformative growth strategies make great progress in 2022, and we validated that this will drive personal Property-Liability market share growth. Proactive investment risk and return management mitigated approximately $2 billion of loss this year. And while the total return on the portfolio was a negative 4%, that compares very favorably to the performance of the S&P 500 and intermediate bond indices. We also had another great year at Allstate Protection Plans. Moving to Slide 3, let\u2019s discuss financial results. Starting at the top, revenues of $13.6 billion in the fourth quarter were 4.9% higher than the prior year quarter, increasing the full year total to $51.4 billion. Property-Liability premiums earned increased by 9.5% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year and 8.5% for the full year due to higher average premiums in auto and homeowners insurance. Moving down the table, an adjusted net loss of $359 million was incurred in the fourth quarter reflecting an auto insurance underwriting loss, which is impacted by reserve increases for the current and prior years. Now let me turn it over to Mario to discuss our Property-Liability results and then Jess will cover the other components of earnings. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s start by reviewing underwriting profitability for the Property-Liability business in total on Slide 4. The overall message is that the underwriting loss was a result of auto insurance operating at a combined ratio above our targets, but homeowners insurance continued to be a strong source of profit. On the left chart, the recorded combined ratio of 109.1 in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by higher auto loss costs, unfavorable reserve development and higher catastrophes. This led to a full year recorded combined ratio of 106.6, which was 10.7 points higher than the prior year. The table on the right shows the combined ratio and underwriting income by line of business for the quarter and the year. Auto insurance had a combined ratio of 112.6 in the quarter and 110.1 for the year, substantially worse than our targets given rapidly increasing loss costs throughout the year. This result was an underwriting loss of $974 million in the quarter and over $3 billion for the year. Hence, you can see why Tom has said executing our auto profit improvement plan is the number one priority going forward. Homeowners insurance, on the other hand, had excellent results with the combined \u2013 with combined ratios in the low 90s, which generated $681 million of underwriting income for the year. This reflects industry-leading underwriting and risk management in this line of business. Commercial insurance was negatively impacted by the same auto insurance cost pressures, along with inadequate pricing for the coverage provided to the large transportation network companies. The result was an underwriting loss for the year of $464 million. This led to the decision discussed last quarter to not provide insurance to transportation network companies unless telematics-based pricing is implemented and to exit five states in the Allstate traditional commercial business. These actions are expected to reduce commercial business premiums by over 50% in 2023. Now let\u2019s move to Slide 5 and discuss auto margin in more detail. As you can see from the chart on the left, which shows the auto insurance combined ratio and underlying combined ratio from 2017 through the current year, we have a long history of sustained profitability in auto insurance due to pricing sophistication, underwriting and claims expertise and expense management. In 2020, the combined ratio dropped to 86 even though we provided customers with over $1 billion of shelter-in-place payments. This was due to historically low accident frequency in the early stages of the pandemic. In 2021, frequency increased as mileage driven increased, but it did not reach pre-pandemic levels. Claims severity, however, increased above historical levels because of more severe increasing costs to settle claims with third parties, who are injured in accidents with our customers. In addition, used car prices were increasing at unprecedented levels, eventually peaking in December, reflecting an approximate 50% increase over the prior year. We had a reported combined ratio of 95 for the year despite all these pressures. This year, the combined ratio increased 14.7 points to 110.1, the drivers of which are shown in the right-hand chart. The red bars reflect the impact of increasing loss costs, including a 3.6 point impact from prior year reserve additions and a 16.7 point impact from current year underlying losses, excluding catastrophes, which include increases in both frequency and more significantly, severity compared to last year. As we discussed, the core component of the profit improvement plan is to raise auto insurance rates and substantial progress was made on this front starting in the fourth quarter of 2021 and throughout last year. In 2022, the impact of higher average earned premium drove a benefit of 3.6 points, which is shown in green. As I will cover in a minute, there is much more benefit to be realized in earned premiums based on what was implemented in 2022. Another part of the profit improvement plan is to reduce expenses and this contributed a favorable 2 point benefit this year. Moving to Slide 6. Let\u2019s discuss prior year reserve re-estimates before we look forward. Our loss estimates and reserve liabilities use consistent practices, multiple analytical methods and two external actuarial reviews to ensure reserve adequacy. These processes led us to increase the reserve liability for prior years throughout 2022 by amounts that are larger than recent years. Property-Liability prior year reserve strengthening, excluding catastrophes totaled $1.7 billion or 3.9 points on the combined ratio for the full year 2022. The pie chart on the left breaks down the impact by line and coverage with $1.1 billion driven by Allstate Brand personal auto largely related to bodily injury claims. In addition $295 million was related to Allstate Brand commercial insurance, also mostly related to auto. The table on the right breaks down the Allstate Brand auto prior year reserve strengthening of $1.1 billion in 2022 by report year. Let me orient you to the table. Reserve increases are shown by coverage in total and then for the report here to which they apply. The reserve liability for physical damage coverages was increased by $211 million, which was entirely attributable to 2021. This primarily related to adverse development and elongated repair time frames, which were primarily addressed in the first and second quarter. Injury reserves were the largest component at $676 million, which was spread across many report years. Incurred but not reported was increased by $226 million as late reported claim counts have exceeded prior estimates. This reserve balance was increased in each of the first three quarters of 2022, but a larger amount was recorded in the fourth quarter. In total for all coverages about 63% of the increases were for 2021 and 2020. At the bottom of the table, the reported combined ratio for the calendar year is shown and compared to the reserve changes. For example in 2021, the reported combined ratios for Allstate Brand auto insurance was 95. The reserve additions indicate that costs were 2.1 points above this reported number. Estimating reserve liability utilizes multiple reserving techniques, but is always subject to strengthening or releasing reserves over time. This variability increases with changes in the underlying data, such as claim counts, settlement times, or cost increases and as has been the case over the past three years. While reserves could change going forward, based on the 2022 claim statistics and data, reserves are appropriately established at year-end 2022. Moving to Slide 7. Let\u2019s provide some clarity on what the auto insurance combined ratio trend was by quarter in 2022. As you can see on the left-hand chart, the recorded combined ratio peaked in the third quarter at 117.4, largely reflecting prior year reserve changes and catastrophe losses shown in light blue. The dark blue bars are the underlying combined ratio, as reported, which increased each quarter. Included in this dark blue bar is the impact of increasing claim severities within the year. We update the forecast on claim severities as the year progresses. As 2022 developed, loss cost trends resulted in increases to current report year ultimate severity expectations. As shown in the call out on the left chart, 2022 incurred severities for collision, property damage and bodily injury was 17%, 21% and 14%, respectively, above the full report year 2021 level. This estimate, however, increased throughout the year. The impact of increasing current report year on incurred severities as the year progressed influences the quarter underlying combined ratio trend. This impact from increasing full year severities from claims occurring in prior quarters is reflected in the financial results of the period where severities were increased. For example, the fourth quarter of 2022 reflects the impact of higher severity expectations in the auto physical damage coverage, not just for claims reported in Q4 but also for claims that were reported throughout the prior three quarters as well. The chart on the right adjusts the quarterly underlying combined ratio to reflect full year average severity levels, which removes the influence of intra-year severity changes. As you can see, after adjusting for the timing of severity increases in the current year, the quarterly underlying combined ratio trend was essentially flat throughout 2022 and close to the full year level of 103.6. Slide 8 outlines our comprehensive approach to restore auto margins. There are four areas of focus : raising rates; a continued focus on reducing expenses; implementing stricter underwriting requirements; and modifying claim practices to manage loss costs. Starting with rates, since the beginning of this year, we\u2019ve implemented rate increases of 16.9% in the Allstate Brand, including 6.1% in the fourth quarter, which significantly increased written premium. We expect to continue to pursue significant rate increases into 2023 to improve auto insurance margins to target levels. We are also reducing operating expenses as part of transformative growth and have temporarily reduced advertising spend to manage new business volume. We are implementing more restrictive underwriting actions on new business in locations or risk segments where we cannot achieve adequate prices for the risk. Increased restrictions have been implemented in 37 states including California, New York and New Jersey, which account for a large portion of underwriting losses. Claim practices have been modified to deal with the higher loss cost environment. For example, we have strategic partnerships with part suppliers and repair facilities to mitigate the cost of repair and use predictive modeling to optimize repair versus total loss decisions and likelihood of injury and attorney representation. Moving to Slide 9, let\u2019s discuss a key component of our multifaceted plan raising auto insurance prices. Growth in average premium per policy is accelerating due to implemented rate increases, but the impact to average earned premium per policy is on a lag due to the six-month policy term. The chart on the left depicts the year-over-year growth in auto average gross written premium in orange, reaching 14.4% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The auto average earned premium growth of 9.7% in the fourth quarter, represented in blue, continues to increase, but on a lag due to the six-month policy term. The chart on the right is an estimation of when the rate increase is implemented will be earned into premiums. Of course, actual earned premium growth will be influenced by changes in the number of policies in force and absolute levels of new business and retention. This illustrative example assumes 85% of the annualized written premium will be earned since customers modify policy terms such as deductibles or limits where they may not renew. Starting on the left, over the last 15 months, we\u2019ve implemented Allstate brand auto rate increases of 19.8% for an estimated annualized written premium impact of approximately $4.8 billion. Using the historical 85% effectiveness assumption nets a total of $4.1 billion in expected earned premium, represented by the second blue bar. Approximately $1.2 billion has been earned through the fourth quarter. Of the remaining $2.9 billion of premium yet to be earned, roughly $2.6 billion will be earned in 2023 and $300 million in 2024 as shown in green. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to implement additional rate increases in 2023, which will be additive to the figures shown on this chart. Slide 10 illustrates the drivers that will determine the timing of improved auto profitability. The chart on this page is an illustrative view we\u2019ve shown in the past on our path to target profitability along with the magnitude of actions already taken and required prospectively. Starting on the left, the first blue bar shows the year-end 2022 auto insurance reported combined ratio 110.1. To start with the normalized base, we removed the impact of prior year reserve increases and normalized the catastrophe loss ratio for our five-year historical average. This improves the combined ratio by roughly 4.5 points. The second green bar reflects the estimated impact of rate actions already implemented when fully earned into premium, which we discussed on the prior slide. The impact on the combined ratio is approximately 10.5 points when combining the Allstate brand and the National General brand actions. Those two adjustments would improve the combined ratio to target levels. Now of course, we know that loss costs will increase, whether from severity or accident frequency, which would increase the combined ratio. So prospective rate increases and other margin improvement actions must meet or exceed loss cost increases to achieve historical returns. We continue to manage the auto insurance business with the expectation to achieve an auto insurance combined ratio target in the mid-90s. Moving to Slide 11, the table shows Allstate brand auto results in three major states : California, New York and New Jersey combined contributed approximately a quarter of the Allstate brand auto written premiums in 2022 but accounted for approximately 45% of the underwriting loss. While rates were increased in 2022 by 7% to 10%, this is not enough to achieve target margins. As a result, we have more work to do, some of which is listed on the right-hand side. The right-hand side of the slide is a list of actions we are taking in each of these states to improve margins. In California, we filed for an additional 6.9% rate increase in January after getting approval for an initial 6.9% rate increase and are significantly increasing down payment requirements. In New York, while multiple rate filings were requested, only partial approval of the increases requires us to make additional rate filings in early 2023, increased down payment requirements, allowable prior incidents and channel restrictions means fewer choices for consumers until an adequate rate is approved. In New Jersey, additional rate filings will also be made and similar underwriting actions will be implemented as those taken in New York. Moving to Slide 12. Let\u2019s look at a continued good performance story in homeowners insurance. As you know a significant portion of our customers bundle home and auto insurance, which improves retention and the overall economics of both product lines. We have a differentiated homeowners product, underwriting, reinsurance and claims ecosystem that is unique in the industry. Net written premium has increased significantly throughout 2021 and into 2022, increasing 9.3% from the prior year quarter and 12% for the full year, predominantly driven by higher average gross written premium per policy and a 1.4% increase in policies in force. National general written premiums also increased as we improved underwriting margins closer to targeted levels. The fourth quarter combined ratio for homeowners of 92.6 increased by 5.5 points compared to the prior year quarter, while full year combined ratio of 93.8 and declined by 3 points compared to 2021. For the year, this line generated $681 million of underwriting income. The increase in the fourth quarter is shown on the right side. The increased combined ratio was driven by elevated catastrophe losses, primarily due to winter storm Elliot. Homeowners insurance was also impacted by the higher loss cost environment as we continue to experience higher severities due to increasing labor and material costs. To address the inflationary environment, our products have sophisticated pricing features that respond to changes in home replacement values. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Jess to discuss the remainder of our results. Jess Merten : All right. Thank you, Mario. Well, property liability is a core business for us. There are other important drivers of financial performance to discuss, starting with investment income on Slide 13. As shown in the table at the bottom left, the total return of our portfolio is 2.5% in the fourth quarter and negative 4% for the year. These returns for our broadly diversified portfolio compare favorably to the full year performance for the S&P 500 of negative 18%, and to the Bloomberg Intermediate Bond Index return of negative 9%. Net investment income shown in the chart on the left totaled $557 million in the quarter, which is $290 million below fourth quarter last year. Market-based income of $464 million, which is shown in blue, was $101 million above the prior year quarter. This is the third consecutive quarter of increase as we benefit from reinvestment at higher market yields. Performance-based income of $147 million shown in black was $369 million below a strong prior year quarter. Income this quarter included in negative contribution from valuation of private equity fund investments that was more than offset by positive contributions from direct investments along with positive returns for infrastructure in real estate. The chart on the right shows the fixed income yield is rising and was 3.2% at quarter end, but is still below the current intermediate corporate bond yield at 5.3%. Also shown is that duration increased modestly to 3.4 in the fourth quarter, primarily by removing approximately half of our duration shortening interest rate derivatives. The migration of the portfolio to higher yield and the corresponding increase in income will happen over time as we reinvest portfolio cash flows into higher interest rates. With the portfolio in unrealized loss positions accelerating this shift by selling bonds to generate capital losses but will be pursued if it optimizes enterprise risk and return. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 14 and talk more about how enterprise risk and return management impacts investment allocations and results. Proactive investment management is highly integrated with risk adjusted return opportunities across the enterprise. We discussed this in detail on our September 1 Special Topic call on investments. In 2021, we decided to lower overall risk levels given the declines in auto insurance profitability. We also expected that sustained inflation would lead to higher interest rates. As a result, the economic capital deployed to investments was reduced. This led to a shortening of the bond portfolio through the sale of long corporate and municipal bonds and the use of derivatives. While adverse market conditions negatively impacted our portfolio, these actions mitigated losses by approximately $2 billion. In 2022, giving continued auto insurance losses, we decided to lower the potential for investment losses as the U.S. economy went into recession. At the same time, interest rates were increasing, offering a better risk adjusted return from fixed income. Consequently, holdings and below investment grade bonds were cut almost in half, and public equity holdings were lowered by 40%. Late in the year, interest rates had increased in the duration of the bond portfolio was extended as shown on the previous slide. About half the duration shortening derivative position was removed in the fourth quarter, at the same time, this lowered the amount of economic capital deployed to investments. These actions optimize enterprise risk and return and provide flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities as economic conditions evolve. The Protection Services businesses also create shareholder value, as shown on Slide 15. Revenues, excluding the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, increased 6.1% to $643 million in the quarter and 8.7% to $2.5 billion for the full year 2022. The increase in revenue for the fourth quarter and full year was primarily driven by Allstate Protection Plans growth of 16.9% and 15.7% respectively. As you can see from the table on the right, Allstate Protection Plans continues to rapidly expand with written premium of $1.9 billion for the year. Allstate Protection Plans expansion in 2022 is primarily driven by our investment in appliance and furniture product coverages. We continue to believe there\u2019s a significant growth opportunity in these areas and in our continued expansion of European consumer electronics and other international growth. Given, the longer policy term compared to auto and homeowner\u2019s insurance products, the unearned premium balance continues to significantly grow as well, reaching $2.6 billion at the end of the year. For the segment, adjusted net income of $38 million in the quarter, increased $9 million compared to the prior year due to a one-time net tax benefit in Allstate Protection Plans. Full year adjusted net income of $169 million, decreased $10 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to the lower revenue in Arity as a result of decreased insurer client advertising. We\u2019ll continue to invest in growing these businesses as they provide an attractive opportunity to meet customers\u2019 needs and create economic value for our shareholders. Moving on to Slide 16, Allstate Health and Benefits is growing an attractive set of businesses that protects more than 4 million policy holders. The acquisition of National General in 2021 added both group and individual products to our portfolio as you can see on the left. Revenues of $579 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, excluding the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, decreased 1.5% to the prior year quarter as a reduction in individual health was partially offset by an increase in group health and other revenue. Adjusted net income of $50 million, increased $2 million compared to the prior year quarter, resulting in a full year 2022 income of $222 million. The full year 2022 result was $14 million above prior year and reflects increases in group health revenues partially offset by higher operating costs and expenses on group health contract benefits. Let\u2019s close by highlighting Allstate\u2019s strong financial condition and proactive approach to capital management, which you can see on Slide 17. We ended the year with $4 billion in holding company assets, which represents an increase of $700 million compared to year end 2021. We believe holding company assets and capital resources available from statutory operating companies provide financial flexibility as we continue to implement profit proven actions, invest in Transformative Growth and return capital to shareholders. As you can see, our adjusted net loss in 2022 resulted in a negative adjusted net income return on equity. Executing our comprehensive plan in achieving target combined ratios for auto and homeowners insurance will bring adjusted net income returns and equity back to our long-term target range of 14% to 17%. In 2022, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through $2.5 billion in share repurchases and $926 million in common shareholder dividends. This resulted in common shares outstanding being reduced by 6.1%, reflecting the repurchase of 19.7 million shares in 2022. With that as context, let\u2019s open the line for your questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Your question, please. Paul Newsome : Good morning. I wanted to ask about claims management process that over the course of the last couple of years, I think of Allstate is having a superior claims management in auto and home and that is being kind of one of the core advantages. But you\u2019ve also been implementing a lot of cost cuts and laying off folks over the last couple years. So how are you sort of balancing that? And are there some core metrics that we can see as outsiders that suggest that advantage relative to your peers still exists? Tom Wilson : Thank you, Paul. Good morning. Let me make a few overview comments and then Mario can jump in. You\u2019re correct that one of our competitive advantages really claim [indiscernible] settling what are millions of claims a year. And we really look at like a \u2013 it\u2019s a systems approach. It\u2019s not the result of adding one person process or vendor arrangement. But like for example, if you look at auto insurance, we have this network of auto body repair facilities enables us to both source high quality costs, high quality repairs, good costs and in timely stuff. So cutting down things like car, rental use and stuff like that. At the same time, we have extensive use of analytics, whether that\u2019s the value of an individual car in a local market with specific options to settlements of complicated multi-year bodily injury claims or fraud detection. Part sourcing and buying that Mario talked about enables us to both control the price of those parts by buying them in bulk. But also deciding which part you use. You use an OE [ph] part or an aftermarket part, what\u2019s available in the local market. So the reason I\u2019m going through that is it\u2019s a really complicated system that works really well. We\u2019ve got good employee training, got good technology, we have good quality control processes. And we do have metrics that you can look at to determine how we\u2019re doing versus the outside. There\u2019s first call reporting and there\u2019s some other external reporting which shows, for example, that we have. We buy \u2013 we pay less per claim for parts and labor than other people. So some of that information like first call you guys could have access to others \u2013 we get from other sources. But it \u2013 what it tells us is that we\u2019re good. Now, anytime you\u2019re good, the only reason \u2013 the only way you stay good is you keep changing and getting better and updating processes. And so as we\u2019ve dealt with these dramatic swings and frequency and costs, we continue to implement changes to improve the effectiveness and efficiency and Mario can talk about those. Are we perfect? No. Are we constantly reassessing everything we do to make sure we\u2019re getting the right price for parts and we\u2019re settling at the right value for customers of course. Do we believe it\u2019s still a continued competitive advantage for Allstate? Yes. So Mario, would you want to talk about some of the things you worked on last year and what you have looking forward this year? Mario Rizzo : Yes, thanks Tom, and thanks for the question, Paul. First thing, I would reiterate what Tom said. We continue to view our claims capabilities as a competitive differentiator and a source of real value for Allstate. We think that\u2019s been \u2013 certainly been true in the past and it\u2019ll continue to be true going forward. The reality is given the environment we\u2019re operating in, both from a casualty perspective as well as physical damage, we\u2019ve talked a lot throughout the year around the drivers of inflation and the things that are driving up loss costs at such a rapid pace. And I think what that does is it really forces us and the industry to continue to evolve those practices. And it\u2019s certainly something we\u2019ve done overtime to continue to maintain in our leadership position and our edge when it comes to claims. So let me just spend a minute and I\u2019ll break out casualty versus physical damage. In terms of the action plans, we talk a lot about changing operational processes. I\u2019ll say a couple things starting with casualty first. One of the things we\u2019ve done over the past 12 plus months is we\u2019ve meaningfully reduced the volume of pending bodily injury claims by about 20%. And what that does is it reduces risk of both of inflation impacting those claims that certainly that we\u2019ve settled and remediated going forward. But also reduces we think reserve uncertainty on those claims going forward. And to just give you a sense of context, the current level of bodily injury pending claims in aggregate is at its lowest level that it\u2019s been since before 2016. So we\u2019ve looked to de-risk the bodily injury pending portfolio by leaning in and settling claims. We\u2019re also focusing on a strategy that I would characterize as an earlier strategy when it comes to bodily injury. Things like earlier recognition of injury claims, earlier claimant contact and earlier settlement of claims that we should settle quickly again to avoid the inflationary risk in the current environment. And what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re leveraging our advanced data and analytics capabilities to execute on all components of that strategy to continue to evolve and get better in casualty claim handling. On the physical damage side, I think it\u2019s really around, broadly continuing to focus on estimation accuracy cycle time and leveraging \u2013 further leveraging our scale to the fullest extent. It\u2019s continuing to increase the utilization of our good hands repair network to reduce costs, both in terms of parts and labor costs and improve cycle time while continuing to improve or provide a high quality customer experience. Enhancing total loss processes to reduce cycle time and reduce costs around things like storage and rental costs and identification of preexisting damage on vehicles, again, to move total losses through the system more rapidly. And then continuing to look to leverage our scale additionally when it comes to sourcing parts and getting as efficient as we can from a process perspective. So we\u2019re really attacking claims across a number of fronts. Again, feel really good about where we\u2019re positioned with claims. And this is all about continuing to get better and maintain that industry leading capability on the claim side. Operator : Thank you. One moment\u2026 Paul Newsome : Is there any difference in how you handle claims across the distribution systems at this point that would vary the execution of claims? Mario Rizzo : This is Mario. Yes, sure. I\u2019ll jump in. Process wise, we adopt consistent processes across claims. There\u2019s certainly unique processes. For example, in National General, given the non-standard auto mix, there\u2019s just a different approach to those claims because they potentially have a higher risk of fraud. So there\u2019s some unique processes there. But in terms of claim handling consistency for similar types of claims, we tend to leverage best practices across brands. Paul Newsome : Great. Thank you for your help as always. Really appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of C. Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Your question please. C. Gregory Peters : Good morning everyone. Tough quarter and a tough year for the company. I was looking at Slide 11 in the supplement. And this is the slide that talks about the Allstate brand auto state profitability. And if we look at the number of states that have a combined ratio above 100, it steadily increased through the fourth quarter and it kind of a contrary to the comments you made about the rate that you applied and achieved in the year. So my question is what type of expectation do you have for that category of states above 100 as we move through 2023? Is it kind of peak here at 41? Do you think it could get worse? Or what\u2019s your expectation going forward of how that might trend? Tom Wilson : Greg, let me provide an overview, then Mario can jump in on it. First, as we said and you know well that improving auto profitability will be a key to driving shareholder value. So we\u2019re all over that. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress. Mario showed about the rate increases. And so of the $4.1 billion that we think will still come true, or that will come through from the rate increases we\u2019ve already implemented, we\u2019ve got $1.2 billion, $2.6 billion of that should show up in 2023. And I would point out that, that\u2019s not in those combined ratio numbers. So our objective is to make money in every line in every state. So no cross subsidies between states, no cross-subsidies between lines. Now, of course, that\u2019s hard to do with as many lines as many states we\u2019re in, but that\u2019s our objective. And so the amount \u2013 that amount that\u2019s not reflected in the \u2013 some of those states. We think some of those states are probably adequately priced today. There are many that are not, and so we\u2019ll continue to drive those. But I would expect to see that number come down. But we don\u2019t have a target of \u2013 we\u2019re at 41 at the end of the year. We want to be at some XX at the end of the first quarter. It\u2019s every state, every line, make money every year. Mario, would you want to add some additional color to that? Mario Rizzo : Sure. And thanks for the question, Greg. Look, I think when you look at that trend of states above 100 and the increase throughout the year, I think what I\u2019d point you to is when you just \u2013 you look at our underlying auto combined ratio as we reported it, increasing throughout the year and being driven by increases in our severity expectations quarter-over-quarter as the year played out, as well as increasing frequency between Q1 through Q4, only partially being offset by the rate that we took. So I think that chart mirrors what we show you in aggregate in terms of the reported underlying combined ratio. But when you look at our business from a state perspective, I think it\u2019s important to really categorize states into a couple of different buckets. I think there\u2019s a group of states that while we certainly are pleased with the outcome of an underwriting loss, given the actions we\u2019ve taken, particularly from a rate perspective as well as underwriting actions, we feel like we\u2019re positioned in a good place. Now you can\u2019t predict the future in terms of the path of inflation or severity going forward. But given the actions we\u2019ve taken, we feel good about where we\u2019re positioned and what the outlook looks like for 2023. I put states like Texas, Georgia, a couple of large states for us where we\u2019ve implemented significant rates and have been successful in doing so. And so we feel good about the outlook. Again, we\u2019ll have to adapt to what changes in the future, but I think there is a lot of states that falls into that category. Unfortunately, there is a number of, for us, pretty meaningful states, three of which we highlighted in the presentation : California, New York, New Jersey, where they\u2019re much more challenging regulatory environments. And we need to continue to execute on both rate increases and underwriting restrictions to curb growth to really bend the line in aggregate. And just using California as one example. So as you all know, we got a 6.9% rate approved late in the year, but we immediately filed another 6.9% increase pending with the department. We took down paid requirements up pretty dramatically. We have not changed those down paid requirements even with the first rate. We\u2019re working with the department on getting approval for the second 6.9%. But then we\u2019re going to come back with another rate increase because we need more rate in California. So that\u2019s a big state for us where we\u2019re going to have to continue to really lean in and take \u2013 continue to take dramatic and aggressive actions to improve margins. And I put New York in that same category. We got a 5% flex rate in New York. Middle of the year, we got approval for a 9.4% rate in New York towards the end of the year, while we\u2019re prepared to do additional \u2013 an additional round of rate filings in New York early in 2023, because loss trends are not where they need to be. And in the interim, we\u2019ve taken underwriting actions around prior incidents, down pay and other actions to curb new business growth, and we\u2019re going to continue to lean into those actions because we can\u2019t afford to write the new business at the current rate levels and we\u2019ll continue to take the appropriate actions there. So I think you got to look at the states in a different way. I think we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in a number of states, but we still have some work to do. And as we said, we expect to take some pretty significant rate increases in 2023, particularly leaning into some of those states where we haven\u2019t, really for regulatory reasons been able to make the kind of progress that we would have liked. C. Gregory Peters : That\u2019s good detail. Just the follow-up question on those three states, California, New York and New Jersey. And I know you\u2019re not going to start negotiating with the Departments of Insurance on an earnings conference call. But when I look at California, for example, you yourself said 6.9% is not going to be enough. One of your competitors recently got, just last month got a rate increase improved that was in the teens. Why not pivot and get more aggressive with rate filings in some of these challenging states? It seems like some of your peers might be doing that and getting \u2013 having some success. Tom Wilson : Greg, I would just maybe provide \u2013 I think we\u2019ve been very aggressive when you look at how much we\u2019ve raised rates in total for the year across the country. We\u2019ve been very aggressive. And depending whose measures you want to use, more aggressive. As you never really know where people start and what they finish and what their losses are. Mario, do you want to talk specifically about California? Mario Rizzo : Yes. Sure. So, Greg, I think we\u2019ve been working really closely with the Department of Insurance in California. We were able to pretty rapidly get approval of our first 6.9%, and we\u2019re in active dialogue around the second 6.9%. And as I mentioned, when we get that one behind us, there\u2019ll be a third one coming. We always have the option of going down the path of filing a larger rate increase. California generally takes a longer time period to get approvals for rates as it is. And the one you mentioned specifically, I think, have been pending with the department for over a year. So we\u2019re \u2013 as we look at the map, we want to get approval, we want to get approval as rapidly as we can, so we can implement the rates and move on. So the approach we\u2019ve taken so far in California, we\u2019re comfortable with. We\u2019re going to continue to lean in. We always have the option to change course if things change. But so far, we\u2019ve had success with the path we\u2019ve taken, and we\u2019re going to continue to push on that. C. Gregory Peters : Thank you for the answers. Operator : Thank you, one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question please. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is just on capital, right? You guys said you expect to complete the buyback program by the \u2013 still by the end of the third quarter of 2023. Can you just help us understand what metrics you\u2019re looking at to judge the capital adequacy of Allstate Insurance Company at the end of 2022? I think in the past, you\u2019ve said you look at RBC ratios there. Can you give us a sense of where you ended 2022 your RBC was, and where you would like that to be over time? Tom Wilson : Elyse, I\u2019ll let Jess give you some specifics, but we obviously have a long history of managing capital that both balances our financial strength, growth returns to shareholders. We have plenty of capital to grow our business and pursue attractive risk and return opportunities. We do it in a much more sophisticated way than RBC. So for example, when Jess talked about the things we had done in the investment portfolio, that we allocate specific amounts of capital to different investment allocations. So when we dial up interest rate risk, we put a little more capital up for it. If we dial down equities, we put up less capital, and we believe we\u2019re really well capitalized and don\u2019t have any issues. Jess, do you want to go from there? Jess Merten : Yes. Thanks, Tom. So Elyse, I think as it relates to your question on RBC, we haven\u2019t disclosed the RBC for the year. That will come out in due course as it relates to the actual RBC in insurance company, and we don\u2019t publish a target. I think Tom hit on the right point, because you asked what are the metrics that we look at as we think about the repurchases. And we really do focus on our sophisticated economic capital model that looks at a comprehensive view of risk across types around the enterprise. And we use that as the basis for capital management. We obviously focus on RBC rating agency metrics, a variety of other things. But we don\u2019t have specific targets that we published as it relates to risk-based capital. So \u2013 and I really like to take it up a level and just think about how we manage it overall using our sophisticated, risk-based capital framework. We remain confident in our overall capital position and the capital position of the insurance subsidiaries. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my second question is going back to some of what you guys have been discussing with modifying your claims practices. Have you guys tested the predictive modeling on an external data against your own internal data and seeing a meaningful benefit? And should we \u2013 how \u2013 over what time period should we think about the rollout of the program over the next year, 12 months to 24 months, on what type of time frame should we be thinking about? Tom Wilson : Elyse, I\u2019m not sure which predictive models are you talking about the \u2013 I mean we use predictive models for a lot in claims. Was there one specifically you were interested in? Elyse Greenspan : Well, I was talking about some of the kind of changes you guys have stressed that you\u2019re kind of looking to make on the claims side of things. Tom Wilson : Okay. Yes. Let me \u2013 I\u2019ll take a shot at it and Mario, you can jump in. So we use \u2013 I mean we\u2019re a data-driven company, so we use predictive models as you know well, for just about everything. That could be fraud. There could be \u2013 do we think this claim might end up being severe enough where it gets represented by a lawyer? So it\u2019s important for us to establish a relationship with the customers as possible. It might be, do we think there\u2019s a better way to settle this claim, whether it gets \u2013 the car gets totaled or we send it to a body shop. So there\u2019s we use predictive analytics throughout the business and obviously largely in claims as well. So we\u2019re always tuning those. We think we\u2019re pretty good at it. You can\u2019t really take one specific algorithm. But when you look at our claims severities, you can look at them externally. And when you look at absolute dollars, we think we did really well. It\u2019s easier on physical damage, obviously, because you\u2019re just fixing a car bodily injury, it\u2019s like, okay, well, what was the case worth? What\u2019s the average case? That gets a little harder to do. But when in \u2013 the only weakness in the external stuff is it tends to be a percentage increase over the prior year, which is, of course, we work in absolute dollars. And our models are done in absolute dollars. And so even though it all depends where you start \u2013 but we like our overall position. Mario, do you want to talk specifically about any models that you\u2019re using now that think you can point to where we\u2019ve updated and increased the value-added? Mario Rizzo : Yes. The one I\u2019d point to, and I think generally, the statement Tom made about like leveraging all the data and the capabilities we have, but also looking to tune those models and evolve over time. The example I would use would be around bodily injury, both potential loss identification and attorney representation. Given, obviously, the environment around us has evolved pretty significantly over the past couple of years in terms of higher levels of attorney representation and bodily injury claims and just medical inflation, medical consumption and treatment, those kinds of things. So what we\u2019ve been doing is tuning the models to be able to use the components and the data that we gather early on in the claims process, to identify claims where there is, first of all, the potential for an injury. More importantly, the potential for a major injury given it\u2019s a higher impact accident or things like that. So we can get out ahead of the claim, make contact earlier and manage the claim much more effectively. The same would be true around claims that have the potential, ultimately to be represented by an attorney. Again, creating contact with a third-party claimant and establishing dialogue and communication and leveraging the tools and the models at our disposal to better manage the claim process through the bodily injury claims. So those are just a couple of examples of how we tuned models that we\u2019ve had to adapt to the current environment. And we\u2019re going to have to continue to, as I mentioned earlier, evolve our processes and those models to adapt to the environment over time. So this is not a static process, and we\u2019re always looking to get better based on the most current information as well as the external environment that we\u2019re operating in. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Your question, please. Andrew Kligerman : Hey, thanks a lot for getting me in. First question is around social inflation, and in particular, bad price point. And in 2022, I think the court up a lot. And we \u2013 I would \u2013 I suspect that had a big impact. As we move into 2023, what\u2019s your thinking about further social inflation issues? Do you think it will get materially worse? Could you give us some measurement around that? And that\u2019s the question. Tom Wilson : Mario, do you want to take that? Mario Rizzo : Yes. Certainly, social inflation is a phenomenon that we and the industry have been dealing with for an extended period of time. I think in our business, we certainly see it in the personal auto side, in casualty coverages. We\u2019ve also seen it on commercial auto and in the shared economy, just given the higher limits that we tend to write on that business. It\u2019s hard for me to predict whether it will get better or get worse going forward. I think it\u2019s a reality of what we\u2019re experiencing right now. And as I talked about some of the analytics and the processes we\u2019re putting in place, to identify and manage injury claims more effectively. That\u2019s a big reason why we\u2019re doing it is in response to the social inflationary impacts we\u2019ve seen. I\u2019d also go back to something I said earlier around quickly not only identifying but settling claims earlier in the process where we can to mitigate the potential exposure to social inflation going forward. And the reduction in pending claims across a variety of segments that we\u2019ve already executed on and are going to continue to focus on going forward. So I think our approach has been to modify our processes and take appropriate actions to offset the impacts of social inflation. And again, I don\u2019t want to predict whether it will get better or get worse, but we know it\u2019s a reality and we\u2019ve adapted in response to it. Andrew Kligerman : Was there a big pickup in bad faith claims? Mario Rizzo : I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s a big pickup in bad faith claims now. Andrew Kligerman : Okay. And then the next question is around the rate increase. So I think Greg was touching on how your competitor got in the teens. I think it was 17.4% and you got 6.9%. My question there is should we worry that there will be anti-selection? If other players are getting these big rate increases, will that drive more consumers to Allstate as the pricing appears better in California? Tom Wilson : Mario, do you want to take that? Mario Rizzo : Yes. Look, as I mentioned earlier, even with the rate that we were approved for \u2013 we didn\u2019t change the actions we took around down pay requirements. So our risk appetite is not \u2013 has not changed in California, and it won\u2019t until we get to a point where we believe we\u2019re adequately priced, and that will take at least a couple more rates. Will we get anti-selected against? I think if we keep the restrictions in place or down pay requirements in place, we mitigate that risk. And it\u2019s all relative. The rate increase that was approved was on a much larger indication than the one we filed. So it\u2019s hard to tell what the relative price position is. But again, we\u2019re not going to change our stance. Our focus in California is to reduce growth as much as we can until we get to rate-adequate levels, and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to manage the business. Andrew Kligerman : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Question, please. Josh Shanker : Yes, thank you. I was looking at the new policy application, and I was trying to tease out Allstate, National General and agency versus exclusive agency versus direct. And I noticed that there was a non-significant amount of independent agency, new policy applications coming from non-National General sources. And so I\u2019m wondering, is Allstate brand being sold through independent agencies? And the reason why I asked this is also I noticed that new policy applications from Allstate exclusive agents are up, but Allstate branded new policy applications are down overall. Meaning that it feels like there\u2019s a channel shift that you\u2019re excited about getting business from Allstate exclusive agents, but not from the other sources where you sold Allstate branded products last year. Tom Wilson : Let me provide a little overview. And then Mario you can take it. So Josh, first, we\u2019ll take business from anybody\u2019s, not just for price. You are correct in that you see \u2013 remember, National General, we took \u2013 when we acquired National General, we gave them both the Encompass business, which was straight up independent agents under the Encompass brand. There\u2019s also an Allstate independent agent channel that we\u2019re transitioning to National General products and services over time. So the National General has both of those. On the direct versus agent piece, we\u2019ve been shutting down growth and reducing expenses. We went first to the direct channel because it was faster, and we got more dollars out of it. That doesn\u2019t mean that we have a preference for Allstate agent versus direct. We\u2019ll serve customers any way they want to be served. Mario, do you want to add some additional perspective on that? Mario Rizzo : Yes. And maybe I\u2019ll focus on \u2013 first on the Allstate brand, Josh, in terms of the shift, the mix shift between direct and exclusive agents. So you\u2019ll remember a couple of things. One of the things we did this year was we reduced the amount of advertising spend, particularly lower funnel advertising spend, which directly impacts both volume through the direct channel. And I think you\u2019ve seen a decline in the direct Allstate branded production as a result of that. I think the other thing you\u2019ve seen is the phenomenon we\u2019re experiencing in the exclusive agent channel with Allstate. And I\u2019ll take you back to one of the core tenets of transformative growth was to reduce costs. But one of the components of it was to reduce distribution costs by changing how we compensated our exclusive agents, and also introducing lower cost, higher productive new models. And I think what you see in 2022 is that the model that we put in, that shifts agency compensation more to new customer acquisition has driven a level of engagement and behavior change on behalf of our exclusive agents that\u2019s resulted in an increase in new business production, despite the rate actions that we\u2019ve taken. I think as we go forward, we\u2019re going to continue to evolve the agency model. We\u2019ll continue to shift commission away from renewal to new business. And while at the same time, continue to enhance our direct capabilities so that when we do lean back into growth, we\u2019re willing to accept the grow through any channel that we can write it. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to assume that the first place you\u2019d see kind of sequential growth would be in the direct channel, just given that when we turn advertising back on, that will be where a lot of the claim volume is driven through. But at the same time, we are pleased with the \u2013 again, the engagement and the behavior shift of our exclusive agents and the performance of the new agency models in terms of their levels of productivity, which I think bode well for us from a long-term growth perspective. Josh Shanker : Is there a difference in profitability over the lifetime of the customer, depending on the brand and the channel it\u2019s sourced? And long-term, should there be any difference? Mario Rizzo : Yes, I can jump in. Any Allstate brand, I think over time, it should be the same, right? Because we\u2019re targeting and marketing to the same customer segment and looking to drive the same lifetime value, whether we write it in the agency channel or we write it in the direct channel. And you\u2019ll remember, we\u2019ve gone to differentiated pricing to match the cost of the channel with the price that the consumer is paying. So that kind of normalizes for the acquisition cost or the distribution cost. So we\u2019d be getting the same lifetime value. I think in the National General brand, what we\u2019ve got today is predominantly still a non-standard mix, which has a very different lifetime value than the standard and preferred products that we write in the Allstate brands. But we price for that. We have the fee structure in place for that where \u2013 and we manage that business very effectively to drive value for a much shorter policy life expectancy for those non-standard risks. As we roll out more middle market products in National General, we\u2019ve really started on that process, but we\u2019ve got a ways to go there. The value \u2013 the lifetime value expectancy for that policy group should look and feel a lot like the Allstate brand because we\u2019re leveraging the same data, the same capabilities to expand our capabilities in that market. So I think from a customer segment perspective, it should be very similar across channels, given the same risk profile. Different in non-standard auto, but we\u2019ve got a really effective model in National General to manage that business. Josh Shanker : Thank you for answering my overly belabor questions. Tom Wilson : I know that\u2019s very helpful. So thank you all for tuning in. Allstate\u2019s obviously focused on using our extensive system operating expertise to improve auto insurance margins. And at the same time, as Mario just mentioned, we\u2019re investing in transforming growth to increase our profit liability business. We have upside in front of us on the investment portfolio, and we\u2019re having a good successful expansion of our circle of protection. So thank you all, and we will talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation on today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Mark Nogal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Nogal : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted related material on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement, and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2022 and other public documents for information on potential risks. As some of you know, this will be my final earnings call as the leader of our Investor Relations team, and I will be transitioning to a new role in our P&C finance area supporting National General. I'm leaving Investor Relations in the capable hands of Brent Vandermause, who will be a great partner for all of you going forward. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Good morning. We're excited for Mark, and we're completely confident that Brent is going to give you everything you need to help you decide how and why you want to invest in Allstate. So good morning. We appreciate the investment of your time in Allstate today. Let's start with an overview results, and then Mario and Jess are going to walk through the operating results and the actions that we're taking to increase shareholder value. So let's start on Slide 2. Allstate's strategy, as you know, has two components, increased personal property-liability market share and expand protection services. Those are shown in the two ovals on the left. If you go to the right-hand side of the slide, you can see a summary of the results for the first quarter. We had a net loss of $346 million in the first quarter, which reflects a property liability underwriting loss which was only partially offset by strong investment income and profits from protection services and health and benefits. We're making good progress on executing the comprehensive plans to improve auto insurance profitability, and of course, we'll have a substantive discussion on that today. Not to be overlooked, we also continue to advance Transformative Growth plan, which is to execute the top oval there, which is to increase Property-Liability market share. At the same time, Allstate Protection Plans in the lower oval continues to expand its product offering and geographic footprint. Let's review the financial results on Slide 3. Revenues of $13.8 billion in the first quarter increased 11.8% or nearly $1.5 billion as compared to the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by higher average premiums in auto and homeowners insurance, resulting in Property-Liability earned premium growth of 10.8%. In the auto insurance line, higher insurance premiums and lower expenses were essentially offset by increased loss costs, so the profit improvement plan has not yet returned margins to historical levels. The auto insurance line had an underwriting loss of $346 million in the quarter. In homeowners, the story is really about $1.7 billion of catastrophes, which led to an underwriting loss of $534 million. The total underwriting loss was just under $1 billion. Net investment income of $575 million benefited from higher yields, which mostly offset an income decline from performance-based investments. Protection Services and Health and Benefits generated adjusted net income of $90 million in the quarter. As a result, the adjusted net loss was $342 million or $1.30 a share. Now let me turn it over to Mario to discuss Property-Liability results. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everybody. Let's flip to Slide 4. The chart on the left shows the Property-Liability recorded and underlying combined ratio since 2017. As you can see, Allstate has a long history of generating strong underwriting results though the current operating environment is challenging, with combined ratios over 100 last year and into the first quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 93.3 for the first quarter was slightly below the full year 2022. The second chart compares the full year 2022 recorded combined ratio for all lines of business to the first quarter of this year, which removes the influence of intra-year severity changes that occurred throughout 2022. The first red bar shows the underlying loss ratio was essentially unchanged as higher premiums were offset by increased loss costs. The second red bar on the left shows most of the increase in the combined ratio was driven by higher catastrophe losses, reflecting the widespread severe weather in the first quarter of this year. Expenses were lower by 1.9 points of premiums and minimal non-catastrophe prior year reserve reestimates also had a positive impact. Let's move to Slide 5 to review Allstate's auto insurance profitability in more detail. As you can see from the chart on the left, which shows the auto insurance recorded and underlying combined ratios from 2017 through the current quarter, we have a long history of sustained profitability in auto insurance as we successfully leveraged our capabilities and pricing sophistication, underwriting and claims expertise and expense management to generate excellent returns in the auto insurance business. Since mid-2021, loss costs have increased rapidly, driving combined ratios above our mid-90s target. The profit improvement plan is designed to address these significant loss cost increases, and we're making good progress. The chart on the right compares the recorded combined ratio of 104.4 in the first quarter to full year 2022 results. Starting on the left, higher average earned premiums drove a 5.7 point favorable impact, which is shown in the first green bar. The first red bar reflects a 6.5 point increase in underlying loss cost due to increased accident frequency and severity for the 2023 report year, with severity currently projected in the 9% to 11% range above the full prior report year. A lower expense ratio reflects expense reductions and higher earned premiums. The remaining difference was due to catastrophes and prior year reserve reestimates. All in, both the recorded and underlying combined ratios of 104.4 and 102.6, respectively, improved in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the full year of 2022. Slide 6 provides an update on the execution of our comprehensive approach to increase returns in auto insurance. There are four focus areas, raising rates, reducing expenses, implementing underwriting actions and enhancing claim practices to manage loss costs. Starting with rates. Following increases of 16.9% in 2022, the Allstate brand implemented an additional 1.7% of rate increases in the first quarter. We will continue to pursue rate increases in 2023 to restore auto insurance margins. Reducing operating expenses is core to Transformative Growth. We have also temporarily reduced advertising to reflect a lower appetite for new business. We implemented more restrictive underwriting actions on new business in locations and risk segments where we have not yet achieved adequate prices for the risk. As we move through 2023, it is likely that some of these restrictions will be removed where there are profitable growth opportunities. Enhancing claim practices in a high inflation environment is key to delivering customer value. This includes leveraging strategic partnerships and scale with repair facilities and parts suppliers to mitigate the cost of repairing vehicles. In addition, settlement of pending bodily injury claims has been accelerated to avoid continued increases in costs and settlements. Transitioning to Slide 7. Let's discuss progress in three large states with a disproportionate impact on auto profitability. The table depicts Allstate brand auto new business production and rate actions for California, New York and New Jersey. As a result of implemented profitability actions, new issued applications from the combination of California, New York and New Jersey declined by 40% compared to the prior year quarter. The decline in these three states meaningfully contributed to the 22% decline countrywide. The right-hand portion of the table provides rate increases either taken or needed to improve margins. In California, we just received approval for a second 6.9% rate increase implemented in April, which will be effective in June. We continue to work closely with the California Department on the best path forward to getting rates to an adequate level and expect to file for an additional increase in the second quarter, which will reflect the balance of our full rate need. In New York, we filed for additional rate in the first quarter that is currently pending with the Department of Financial Services. In New Jersey, we attained a 6.9% rate increase in the first quarter and expect to pursue additional filings in the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, we anticipate implementing additional rates across the country into 2023 to counteract persistent loss cost increases. Slide 8 dives deeper into how we are improving customer value through expense reductions. The chart on the left shows the property liability underwriting expense ratio over time and highlights drivers of the 2.9 points of improvement in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter. The first green bar on the left shows the 2 point improvement impact from advertising spend, which has been reduced given a limited interest in new business at current rate levels. The last two green bars show a decline in operating and distribution costs mainly driven by lower agent and employee-related costs and the impact of higher premiums. Shifting to our longer-term target on the right, we remain on pace to reducing the adjusted expense ratio to 23 by year-end 2024 as part of transformative growth. This metric starts with our underwriting expense ratio excluding restructuring, coronavirus-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and advertising. It then adds in our claims expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims because catastrophe-related costs tend to fluctuate. Through innovation and strong execution, we've driven significant improvement relative to 2018, with first quarter adjusted expense ratio of 24.9. We expect to drive additional improvement, achieving an adjusted expense ratio of approximately 23 by the end of next year by represents a 6-point reduction compared to 2018. The increase in average premiums certainly represents a tailwind, however, our intent in establishing the goal is to become more price competitive. This requires a sustainable reduction in our cost structure, with future focus on three principal areas, including enhancing digitization and automation capabilities, improving operating efficiency through outsourcing, business model rationalization and centralized support, and enabling higher growth distribution at lower costs through changes in agency compensation structure and new agent models. Now let's move to Slide 9 to review homeowner insurance results, which incurred an underwriting loss in the quarter despite favorable underlying performance due to elevated catastrophe losses. We have a superior business model that includes differentiated product, underwriting, reinsurance and a claims ecosystem that is unique in the industry. As you can see by the chart on the left, this approach consistently generates industry-leading underwriting results despite quarterly or yearly fluctuations in catastrophe losses. The chart on the right shows key Allstate Protection homeowners insurance operating statistics for the first quarter. Net written premium increased 11.1% from the prior year quarter, predominantly driven by higher average gross written premium per policy in both the Allstate and National General brands and a 1.4% increase in policies in force. The first quarter homeowners combined ratio of 119 increased by 35.1 points compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting higher catastrophe losses primarily related to five large wind events in March. These accounted for more than 70% of catastrophe losses in the quarter. The first quarter catastrophe loss ratio was significantly elevated compared to the prior year and 10-year historical average by 36.2 and 30.5 points, respectively. The underlying combined ratio of 67.6 improved 0.4 points compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher earned premium and a lower expense ratio partially offset by higher claim severity. Slide 10 provides an update on Transformative Growth. Transformative Growth remains a focus and is being executed in parallel with our profit improvement actions. We continue to make good progress on this multiyear initiative that spans five main components : improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition, modernizing the technology ecosystem and driving organizational transformation. The bottom half of the slide highlights recent progress by intended outcome. Providing the lowest cost insurance through expense reductions, broad distribution and pricing sophistication is key to growth. Our Allstate brand relative competitive position has deteriorated recently as rate increases have exceeded some competitors. We expect that those competitors will eventually raise rates, improving our competitive position and growth prospects. Distribution has been expanded by launching middle market and preferred products through independent agents under the National General brand. These products are currently available in approximately 25% of the U.S. market, with a plan to be in nearly every market by the end of next year. Our new affordable, simple and connected auto product creates a differentiated customer experience, which is expected to become available in approximately one-third of the U.S. through the direct distribution channel by the end of this year, deploying a new technology stack, integrating technology across brands and retiring legacy technology applications provides increased agility and lowers costs. This will be reflected in the sunset of the Esurance and Encompass technology platforms next year. We believe transformative growth will lead to increased market share, and hence, higher company valuation multiples. And now, I'll turn it over to Jess to discuss the remainder of our results. Jess Merten : All right. Thank you, Mario. Let's start with Slide 11, which covers results for our Protection Services and Health and Benefits businesses. Chart on the left shows Protection Services revenues excluding the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, which increased 7% to $671 million in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Increase reflects growth in Allstate Protection Plans and Allstate Dealer Services, partially offset by a decline in Arity. By leveraging the Allstate brand, excellent customer service, expanded product offerings and partnerships with leading retailers, Protection Plans continues to generate profitable growth, resulting in a 17% increase in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter. In the table below the chart, you will see that adjusted net income of $34 million in the first quarter decreased $19 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher appliance and furniture claim severity and a higher mix of lower-margin business as we invest in growth at Allstate Protection Plans. We will continue to invest in these businesses which provide an attractive opportunity to meet our customers' needs and create value for shareholders. Shifting to the chart on the right, Health and Benefits provide stable revenues and is consistently profitable while protecting more than 4 million customers. Revenues of $583 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased by $3 million compared to the prior year quarter as an increase in group health and other revenue was partially offset by a reduction in individual health and employee benefits. Health and Benefits operating systems are being rebuilt to lower costs and support growth, which will leverage the Allstate brand and customer base to generate shareholder value. Adjusted net income of $56 million was in line with the prior year quarter. Effective January 1, 2023, we adopted the FASB guidance, revising the accounting for certain long-duration insurance contracts in the Allstate Health and Benefits segment using the modified retrospective approach to the transition date of January 1, 2021. This had an immaterial impact on our results. Now let's move to Slide 12, which depicts trends in our investment portfolio allocation. Our active portfolio management includes comprehensive monitoring of markets, sectors and individual names, and we proactively reposition based on our views of economic conditions, market opportunities and the risk return trade-off. Asset class holdings are shown on the left. Our $63.5 billion investment portfolio includes a large allocation to high quality interest bearing assets, which has increased in recent years. In response to increasing recession risks, we defensively position the portfolio in 2022 by reducing our exposure to below investment grade bonds and public equity. We maintain this defensive position in the first quarter with additional reductions in our public equity exposure. Our performance based portfolio shown in green and gray enhances long-term returns and is broadly diversified with more than 400 assets. The portfolio is largely U.S. exposure that span vintage years, sponsors and sectors. Exposure to real estate and commercial mortgage loans is modest at $2.8 billion or 4% of the portfolio and is focused on more resilient sectors such as industrial and multifamily. We hold only $230 million in office properties for mortgages. In addition to real estate, we have selective exposure to the banking sector totaling about $4.5 billion and consists primarily of investment-grade, fixed income securities issued by large financial institutions. We hold $240 million of exposure to regional banks, primarily larger regional banks, and we did not realize significant losses related to recent bank failures. Our high-quality portfolio provides flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities as economic conditions evolve while providing substantial liquidity to protect our customers. Let's shift from investment allocation to performance on Slide 13. As shown in the table at the bottom of the chart on the left, total return on our portfolio was 2.4% in the first quarter and 1.2% over the last 12 months. Net investment income, shown in the chart on the left, totaled $575 million in the quarter, which is $19 million below the first quarter of last year. Market-based income of $507 million, shown in blue, was $184 million above the prior year quarter following the proactive decision to reposition the market-based portfolio into higher market yields and an increase in fixed income funded by our reduction in public equity. Performance-based income of $126 million, shown in black, was $180 million below a strong prior year quarter. Volatility from quarter-to-quarter on these assets is expected. Our portfolio management and the allocation of risk capital to investments is highly integrated with the assessment of risk-adjusted return opportunities across the enterprise. As you'll recall, in response to declines in auto insurance profitability, last year, we defensively positioned the portfolio against rising rates and reduced our exposure to recession sensitive assets. As market rate grows, we began to increase the duration in the fourth quarter and ended the first quarter at four years. This duration extension locks in higher yields and income for longer while positioning the portfolio to benefit from potential future reductions in interest rates. The chart on the right shows the fixed income earned yield continues to rise and was 3.4% at quarter end. Our portfolio yield is still below the current intermediate corporate bond yield of approximately 5.1%, reflecting an additional opportunity to increase yields if rates stay at these levels. To close, let's turn to Slide 14 to discuss Allstate's strong financial position and prudent approach to capital management. In light of recent financial events impacting the banking industry, let's start with an overview of Allstate's liabilities. As you can see in the chart on the left, our liabilities primarily consist of property casualty claim reserves and unearned premiums that are not subject to unpredictable or immediate demand for repayment. Our sophisticated economic capital framework quantifies enterprise risk to establish capital targets by business, product, geography and investment while also providing additional capital for stress events or contingencies. The framework incorporates regulatory capital standards, proprietary econometric modeling, I struggled with that, rating agency criteria and other external assessments. It's used through the company from individual product and state-based decisions to establishing the appropriate amount of capital for each company and the overall corporation. Allstate's capital of $19.2 billion exceeds our target capital based on this framework. Our ratings remain strong, with S&P and Moody's assigning an issuer credit rating of A minus and A3, respectively, to our recent senior debt offering. Holding company assets of $4.2 billion as of the end of the first quarter represent approximately 2.5x our annual fixed charges. We returned $377 million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases. As a sign of our financial strength and commitment to shareholder returns, the common dividend was increased by 4.7% in the first quarter and paid in early April. With that as context, let's open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Your question please. Gregory Peters : Well, good morning, everyone. A lot to unpack in your comments. I think what I'd like to do for my question and follow-up would be to focus on, first, Slide 5. And I was interested in your comments about the average underlying loss ratio, I think, up 6.5% in first quarter versus the average earned premium being a good guide for 5.7%. I guess the question would be, is the expectation that 6.5% is going to continue? And when will the average earned premium go beyond where the underlying loss ratio deterioration is? Tom Wilson : I'll get Mario to dig in on claim expenses. When you look at the 5.7%, I'll remind you -- first, good morning, Greg. I'll remind you that remember, this is a number that's been trending up as the rates that we took in '21 and '22 start to be earned in. So we would expect that number to continue to increase as we earn in the rates we've already implemented, and so we think this. In terms of claims severity, I'll let Mario give you an update on where we are and what we're thinking about. Mario Rizzo : Yes. Good morning, Greg. So in terms of claims severity, what we disclosed this quarter was across major coverages. We're running in the 9% to 11% range in both physical damage and in injury coverages. Really, the drivers of those costs, if you start with physical damage, we continue to see pretty persistent inflation particularly in parts and labor costs to repair cars. Actually, used car prices or total values for used cars actually came down a little bit in the first quarter in our numbers, but we had a higher percentage of total loss frequency which impacted the mix, so those are really the drivers. And on bodily injury, it's the same things we've been talking about. Medical inflation, medical consumption and attorney representation. So I think the drivers of severity continue to persist. In terms of where they're going forward, it's really anybody's guess, but I think our perspective is, and we've been pretty consistent on this point, we're going to continue to take prices up. We've been doing that really since the fourth quarter of 2021 throughout last year. That continued into the first quarter. We're going to continue to, on a forward-looking basis, implement rate increases to first catch up and then outpace loss cost trends. But our perspective on rates as we continue to need to push more price through the system, and we intend to do that throughout the balance of 2023. Gregory Peters : Right. On Slide 7, you -- in your comments, you talked about those three states. And I guess a follow-up question would be, where do you think that's going to go from a rate perspective? I think you said in your comment, Mario, that you expect to file the balance of your full rate need in California, and won't that trigger a different process causing a delay in potential rate approvals? So give us some color on that slide, please. Mario Rizzo : Sure. So first I'll start with -- as we talked about, we just got approval for a second 6.9% auto rate increase in California, so we're -- going back to the fourth quarter of last year, we've got approval for 2 6.9% rates, and we've done that by working closely with the department to lay out our data and our loss costs. In those conversations, and I think you've seen some of this across the industry, the department is really encouraging carriers to file for the rate need that they have in their book as opposed to going forward with 6.9% rate increase filings, and it's really based on just the volume of rate filings they're getting. So as we talk to the commissioner and the department, we got -- we're able to secure approval for the two 6.9% rate increases, and we intend on filing the balance of our rate need going forward. Does that create risk in intervention? It does. But I think we need to get California auto prices back to where they need to be so that we can create the kind of availability for consumers, really, that they deserve in California. So we're going to work with the department closely, we're going to make that filing, and then we'll see where that takes us going forward. Tom Wilson : So Greg, I think embedded in your question is, will you be challenged on something above 6.9%? The strategy that [Guy Hill] and team put into place was take 6.9% -- get 6.9%, don't have to have a consumer advocate come in and look at it, get another 6.9% and then go for the full rate. So what you're seeing us do it in three chunks. Other people have tried to do it other ways. We think this is the right way for us. Gregory Peters : Got it. In New York, New Jersey? Mario Rizzo : Yes. We got some rate filings pending with the New York department that hopefully will get resolved soon. And then New Jersey, you see, we were able to implement a rate increase and we're going to come back and file another rate increase. So we're working hard to get these three states off of this page. Gregory Peters : Got it. Thank you for the answers. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Your question please. Paul Newsome : Good morning. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more additional color on the risk inflation rate. Is it fair to say that what we saw in the first quarter was an acceleration of frequency or severity trends that was unexpected? And if so, maybe you could talk about a little bit more of the pieces that were that much worse that may have seemed to have caught some people in the industry off guard. Tom Wilson : Paul, you're breaking up a little bit, so let me just make sure I get it. So we're talking about auto insurance severity trends first quarter versus -- is that a tick up from what you saw last year? Or is it the level on? If that's the question, I'll just -- Mario can jump into that. Mario Rizzo : Yes. I guess what I would say about severity, again, in that 9% to 11% range is it just remains persistently high, I think, is how I would describe it, and that's true across coverages. It's certainly lower than what our expectations were for severity last year, what our ultimate forecast is for 2022. But it still remains at elevated levels, which is why I go back to we're going to need to continue to push rate through the system through the balance of this year to combat that inflation. Paul Newsome : Is that -- should we interpret that as a further acceleration of rate? I mean, I think you were expecting to put rate -- more rate anyway, right? I guess the question is do we have a step function up a little bit from where we would have been? Tom Wilson : Yes. Paul, I think there's a little bit of -- I mean, when you're looking at the percentages, it gets a little confusing when you're in a high increase environment. So if you looked at the numbers that Mario was talking about, are the percentages up versus the full year of 2022, not versus the first quarter of last year. As you know, the percentages kept going up as we move throughout the year and we adjusted our results, so what we've decided to do is to talk about the percentages up versus the full year. And I think, Mario, it is -- said it well, which is it continues to be high. And so we're trying to -- if you look at the percentage up versus what we thought it was in the first quarter, it would be higher than 10% to 11%, but it's not higher than what we thought the first quarter was at the end of last year. So as it relates to pricing, we're looking at just total loss cost frequency and severity, and we have to -- we believe we have to continue to increase prices this year. As Mario talked about, we were up almost 17% in the Allstate brand last year. I don't know. We don't have a target for what it will be this year. As Mario said, it's going to be what it needs to be. Paul Newsome : No, that's helpful. I always appreciate the help, and I'll let some other folks ask questions. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question please. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I just wanted to talk about your RBC ratio. I mean, we see the cat losses and we can see the impact that that would have had on statutory income in the quarter. But you guys also did cut your equity investments in half, which I think could have maybe a 20-point benefit in RBC. Is there a way for you guys to walk through the moving components of RBC in the quarter and give us a sense of where your RBC ratio would be within AIC at the end of the Q1? Tom Wilson : Elyse thanks for the question. Let me provide a little overview and then Jess will jump into the specifics. The headline would be, we don't just look at RBC. And so as Jess said, so -- I mean, if you step back and say, what are the learnings from the recent bank failures? Having a capital problem is not something that just happens to you like an auto accident [ph], right? It's a result of a series of choices made over time. So in terms of our series of choices, we had this really comprehensive set of processes around those choices that are highly analytical. We look at all kinds of scenarios. We look at it frequently, and as a result of that, we come up with what we think the right amount of capital. It includes things like RBC it includes things, like the rating agencies it includes. In some cases, we are more restrictive in terms of the amount of capital we think we need than other people. So we don't play the game of RBC arbitrage, so to speak, and fool ourselves. With that, Jess, do you want to talk about how you think about capital and where we're at? Jess Merten : Yes. Thanks, Tom. I mean I think, as you and I have talked before at least, we try and take a look at our capital position using our sophisticated economic capital I know it's not just the RBC ratios. We don't - just to be clear to your specific question. We don't publish and have not published the RBC ratio for this quarter, and so I'm not in a position to take you through the bits and pieces on this call. I think directionally, you and others have noted what the RBC impacts would be. But I think it's more important to think about the way that we manage capital and the way that we look at it on a comprehensive basis, not just and RBC basis. And I think you've seen reflected in the results that we continue to proactively manage our overall capital position. So again, I go back to our economic capital model, the sophisticated and comprehensive way that we look at capital, including all different sources and uses, and feel confident in our capital position being, as I said in my prepared remarks, above our internal targeted levels. Tom Wilson : But you shouldn't take the fact that we have less equity as a statement that we thought we needed to save capital. We have less public equity holdings, because we didn't think it was a good risk return trade-off, which John [ph] will be happy to talk about it if somebody wants to go through. But we think we have plenty of capital on this business. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my second question, your personal auto underlying loss ratio did improve sequentially, right? There are some noise, right, as there were some true-ups in the fourth quarter last year. And also, I thought that seasonally, Q1 for auto tends to be better. But I guess when we put this altogether and you guys you are talking about taking - still earning in some - a good amount of rate increases. Do you think that the personal auto loss ratio peaked in the first quarter and should we expect it to improve from here? Tom Wilson : Well, first, we think the profit improvement plan is working. I would say, Elyse, that if you just summarize the first quarter, I would say we held serve, we held serve in the face of, if you're a tennis fan, 120-mile an hour serve, which was called continued high increase in severity. How will - we'll return the ball, and as you point out, it's about where it was last year. It is improved sequentially in the fourth quarter, but you're absolutely right. Yes, there were some other things going around in the fourth quarter related to the first, second and third quarter of last year. So it's not quite fair to say that it improved. I would just say we held serve. We feel good about where we're going. In our mind, it's a question of when, not if we will get back to how we make profitability. And that's, of course, dependent on what happens with inflation and costs. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question and our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Your question please. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning. May be starting with the current capital position, the reallocation of some of the investments, can you maybe talk about how you see the capital in maybe capital market stress scenarios? And I'm sure you run those internally, any color you can offer around that would be much appreciated? Tom Wilson : Yaron, I'm not exactly sure. Maybe you can give me another layer down in the question so we can get specific for you? Yaron Kinar : Sure. So I think you're talking about, what, roughly $4 billion of liquidity or access about the holdco and I think, $16 billion of liquidity. What happens to those - we find capital markets stressed? I don't know if there's another 25% decrease in the equity market, maybe a credit cycle. I'm not exactly sure what kind of scenario to paint, because I don't want to put you on the spot with a specific set of declines. But I'm sure you do test, this excess capital availability against stresses in the system? Tom Wilson : Yes. No, it's a good point. Let me get John to answer that. I'll give you a little overview [ph]. First, I would just say analytics everywhere. It counts for everyone despite. So whether that's using sophisticated models is that where they toll the car or extending duration or what we're doing with capital. And so, when we look at the extension of duration, I think John ran like nine different scenarios, how to do it, what to do it, what and - so we're all over that. When it comes to stress events in the capital markets, we look at all kinds of alternatives there. Everything from -- and what do we do with the government defaults to what do we do if there's more bank failures. And so we have - and John can tell you sort, of how he's thinking about how we allocate assets in the portfolio relative to stress events in today's market. I would say from an overall capital standpoint, which is we got plenty of money. Like you saw our liabilities, they're very predictable, and so nobody is going to run in and say give us back our $10 billion and we don't have it. At the same time, we have a really highly liquid portfolio, because so much of it's in investment-grade fixed income. If it's fixed - investment-grade fixed income market is completely shut down, we would still probably be fine. Right now probably we would be fine, because we're having cash come in terms of unearned premiums every day, so we don't really have any overall liquidity issues. But in terms of capital market stress and how you think about that from an investment decisions and where we're invested today, John can give you some perspective. John Dugenske : Yes, Yaron, thank you so much for the question. Just a piece of data, if we can trade a security, we've had $5 billion of cash coming in the next year just by things that are rolling off. It's highly integrated into the overall data and analytics quantitative framework across the enterprise. So I answered this question, I feel confident that scores of people on the investment team could answer too, because it's part of the way that we think. We're not managing an investment portfolio separate from the way that we think about the enterprise. Tom talked a little bit about the duration trade that we did that was highlighted in the materials. That's not taken in isolation of how all the other securities in the portfolio would perform and it's not taken in isolation on how we think about the entire enterprise, what happens in underwriting and other areas. We run probably 100 different scenarios on a daily basis that look back at things that have happened in the past, things that could happen in the future, what that means for returns and what that means for capital. And we subscribe to getting the order of ready, aim and fire, right? So we really aim a lot as we think about our investment profile. Yaron Kinar : Thanks. And then maybe shifting back to the auto book, is the piece or the cadence of rate increases that you expect to file in auto kind of similar to where it was when we ended in 2022 or do you see maybe additional rate increases are necessary today relative to the plan at the beginning of the year? Tom Wilson : Where is, the plan at the beginning of the year. So maybe I'll give an overview, Mario, with an analogy and you can bear. We're running as fast and as hard as we can on rates everywhere. If we need them, we're really running fast and hard. If we think, we're actually adequately priced in some states where we are today, we're still paying attention. We're still on the track. We're so warmed up and ready to run if we need to be. Mario Rizzo : Yes. What I would add Yaron, I'm going to go back to a comment I made earlier, which is we've been pretty consistent on this point of the need to take prices up going back to last year, and that hasn't changed. Now obviously, we react to new data, new information in real-time and the absolute amount of rate we take is going to be dependent on that updated data. As Tom mentioned earlier, we rely on heavy-duty analytics to manage the business and we respond to what's happening in real time, so the amount of rate we need will be dependent on how loss costs play out over time for us. But we're going to continue to push rate through the system. We've been successful at that. I wouldn't get too hung up on quarter-to-quarter fluctuations because that quarterly number is going to bounce around in terms of the rates that were approved in a particular state, and the size of those rates. But I think thematically, I'm going to go back to what we've been saying now for -- over the last year, which is we're going to continue to take the rate that we need to get auto margins back to where they need to be, which is in the mid-90s targets that we have. Yaron Kinar : Thanks and good luck, Mark, with the new role. Mario Rizzo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question, and our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Your question please. Andrew Kligerman : Thank you and good morning. I'm trying to unpack the earlier comment about used car prices coming down a bit, because the Manheim Index was up about 8.6%, and that's kind of a forward-looking indicator. So maybe you could kind of give a little color on what your expectation there is for used car prices? Does that kind of fit in your 9% to 11% or could - of projected severity increase or could it be materially higher as we look out in the year? Mario Rizzo : Hi Andrew, it's Mario. Thanks for the question. I guess what I'd start with, there's, a number of indices for used car prices. I think you mentioned one with Manheim that tends to focus on wholesale prices. And I think as we all know, that metric was coming down most of last year. Certainly in the back half of last year, and then it started to tick up in the end of the fourth quarter and has continued into this year. What I was referring to earlier is actual total loss severity, which tends to lag the Manheim Index and is more a function of retail used car prices, which have improved, and that's what I was referring to in the quarter. What we saw was actually used car - or I'm sorry, total loss severity actually improved a little bit year-over-year. In terms of the risk going forward, I think, yes. If you look at what's happening with the Manheim Index and other indices. Certainly, they're headed in a different direction than they were headed for much of last year, which adds risk. We've tried to factor that into our severity expectations in terms of what we're recording that 9% to 11% range. But what we actually saw in the first quarter of this year was a modest improvement in total loss severity. Andrew Kligerman : Got it, all right. Thank you on that. And then it was interesting following National General with auto policies in force now of about $4.6 million off pretty significantly from $4.1 million last year. It looks like you're getting good rate increases. Your combined underlying was 94%, so which is pretty decent. So looking forward, it sounds like you haven't fully rolled it out. Is this something that could really catapult your policy in force at a very responsible return? I mean, maybe a little color on how that - what your expectations over the next year to -- for policy growth and doing so profitably? Tom Wilson : Andrew thanks for focusing in on National General. For summary, we feel really good about the acquisition of National General. If you just start with the math, the numbers, it's exceeded our expectations and assumptions, because as you'll remember, we've mostly bought that so we could reduce our expenses in the independent agent channel by folding, basically having them reverse acquire Encompass, we just happen to buy them first. And so they've - and that's ahead of plan and the numbers are bigger. So, we're feeling really good about that, and that's the way we price the deal. You're - strategically, which is where you're after, we're also getting the benefit of now having a solid plan for an independent agent channel, which we did not before. We've been struggling to get a good platform so they have good technology, good relationships, as you point out, mostly in the nonstandard stuffing. Mario, I think in his comments, mentioned how we're now taking those relationships and that technology platform and we're putting what we call mid-market, which is basically standard auto and homeowners, on that platform, and that's going to give us great growth opportunities because we're using the Allstate expertise in both standard auto and - not to be underestimated, one bit really is our business model and homeowners. We think that's a great growth opportunity and which is basically icing on the cake relative to the acquisition. So, we feel really good about we're in that channel. It's part of Transformative Growth. It's part of increasing market share and personal profit liability, and we're pleased with the results. Andrew Kligerman : Awesome, thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question and our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your question please. Josh Shanker : Yes, thank you. I want to talk about segmentation and policy count. Obviously, the net decline in the auto policy count was quite high this quarter. Do you have some sort of advice or thoughts to think about how much policy count will decline over this repricing period? But two, I also note that homeowners policy count was flat which suggests in the segmentation, there's different policyholders you're keeping versus different policyholders you're losing. So I thought you might be able to touch on both things? Tom Wilson : Good. Mario, why don't you talk about homeowners and what we're doing there to drive growth? As it relates to auto insurance, we just talked about sort of the Allstate brand, I think, which may be the numbers you're referring to, which is down versus Andrew's comment about National General, which is off. On the Allstate piece, there's, obviously two components. One is, are you selling more new business? And then the second is what's happening with retention. And as it relates to new business, we've taken the approach that a prospective rate increase is like a new business penalty. So as you know, when you sell a business, you're going to have - you got expenses. It is getting the customers more to get them right in front, and then the loss ratio is typically higher for new business than it is for existing business. If you need 10 points of rate on top of what you're currently selling it to, we've factored that into our growth projections on new business and said, well this -- at the very least, it's an additional 10 points of new business penalty. The worst is that when you raise your prices by 10%, all the money you spent getting the customer is wasted, because they go away and you churn it. So we've dialed back new business and advertising not so much, because we're trying to manage the P&L, but because we're managing the economic growth. And we think needing rate increases and going out and getting a new customer and saying, it's great, you bought it for $1,000. And then six months later saying, well, it was really $1,100 is not a good plan. So we've dialed back new business, and you see that really across the board. And Mario showed in some places, even more aggressively, like New York, New Jersey, and California have kidded Mario that like, you'll know every new business customer we get in New York if we keep this up personally. So that's basically an economic choice. On retention, of course, that's the customer's choice and it depends what happens in the marketplace and what other people are doing. Our retention has gone down. We do model that out. It's really very difficult to take those old models, so -- and give yourself any kind of good estimate on the current view because a couple of things have changed. One, these are much bigger increases than those models had in them. So those models are based on 5%, 6%, 7%, not on 10%, 12% or 15% or 14% [ph] in Texas. And at the same time, those models don't have the kind of competitive environment you're operating in where everybody else is raising rates at the same time. So we've shutdown new business, because we think it's economic and there's an increased new business penalty associated with being underpriced, and then we're managing to. What we want to do, of course, is we're highly focused on improving customer value, because people pay more, you got to do more for them. And so, we're working hard on making sure we do insurance reviews, get our agents for them [ph] homeowners is another great story that I think we've kind of - we get so focused on auto. We haven't really put - it's a great business model. Mario can talk about what we're doing to grow that business. Mario Rizzo : Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. And homeowners, again, as I talked about in the prepared remarks, is a business that we continue to feel really good about in terms of where it's positioned from a profitable growth perspective. And what you saw in the quarter is that we actually increased policy count by about 1.4%. Retention actually picked up by a temp. And I think there's a couple of things when you kind of unpack what's happening with retention in homeowners because much -- as Tom talked about, we're having to take prices up in auto. The way we're taking price increases is in a highly segmented and targeted way, and that's helping from a retention perspective on homeowners because those bundled customers tend to be our longest-tenured, most profitable customers. We also bundle about 80% of homeowners' policies have on supporting auto line and the retention on a bundled customer where a homeowner that has an auto policy is meaningfully higher than a monoline homeowners, and we're continuing to see the benefit of that. And we've put processes in place both in terms of economic incentives for our agents and sales processes in the call centers on the direct side to incent additional bundling. And we're seeing some nice trends in terms of bundling rates, which is certainly helping homeowner growth through homeowner retention. We're going to continue to look for ways to grow the homeowner business. We think it provides a really compelling risk and return opportunity for us. The results are going to bounce around because there's volatility. This quarter is an example of that with catastrophe losses, but we continue to see our underlying combined ratio and loss ratio improve, and both through leveraging the tactics I talked about for retention production, particularly with bundled customers, we think we can continue to grow that line. Josh Shanker : Are the bundlers having the same problem that they get quoted or rate an entire six months later? Or is your pricing such that you can comfortably quote a bundle right now and think that you're going to retain them for 12 months? Mario Rizzo : Yes, we're obviously quoting bundled customers right now. And when you look at the business we are writing, we're seeing really nice improvements in terms of quality and lifetime value, which is indicative of that bundling rate. And so yes, we're quoting it. And the other thing you got to remember, and this is true both from a retention and a new business perspective. Bundling, it's an easier experience and a more streamlined experience for customers. There's discounts associated with bundling as well that can help offset higher auto rates and incent customers to stay with us. Josh Shanker : Thank you for the detailed answers. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your question please. Brian Meredith : Thanks. A couple of questions here for you. First one, I'm just curious, I saw your expense ratio is down about 1 point x ad spend. Where are we in this Transformational Growth as far as the expense ratio reduction? How much can we potentially see here additional going forward? And then maybe on the -- an add on to that, what kind of a normalized ad spend as a percentage of earned premium, so we can kind of get a view on what our expense ratio should ultimately end up? Mario Rizzo : Yes, Brian, this is Mario. Thanks for the question. Again, expenses as much as Tom talked earlier about, earned premium and loss ratio, we kind of held serve there. We did see the benefit of a lower expense ratio both in terms of the underwriting expense ratio and the adjusted expense ratio. Where we're at in the kind of continuum on the adjusted expense ratio, we set a goal to get that adjusted ratio down to about 23 by the end of 2024. And we're making really good progress on that, you saw continued progress on that this quarter. We certainly are being helped by higher earned premium which leveraged our cost. But we're continuing to see reductions in both operating costs and distribution-related costs, which are helping the expense ratio. And I talked a little bit earlier about the areas we're focused on, whether it's automation, digitization, sourcing and continuing to drive both operating and distribution costs down. We're going to -- those are really going to be the levers we pull to push the expense ratio ultimately to that goal that we set with Transformative Growth. So we're making good progress, feel really good about that. In terms of the level of marketing spend, certainly, we spent less this quarter on marketing than we did a year ago, and we've pulled that back. I think as Tom said earlier, really from an economic risk and return perspective, it doesn't make a lot of sense for us to invest aggressively in marketing at a time when our prices aren't adequate. But what we will do over time has more rates and -- or, I'm sorry, more states and more markets get to a rate level that we're comfortable with, we're going to surgically lean in. And as one of the components of Transformative Growth, we're going to look to both increase the level and the sophistication of the marketing investment that we make. And that will be commensurate with what we think the opportunity is to grow, so I can't sit here today and give you a specific dollar amount or our target that we're focused on. That's why we gave you the adjusted expense ratio, which excludes marketing costs because we're going to continue to invest in marketing when it makes economic sense and where it makes economic sense for us to lean in. Tom Wilson : So let me just double click on the Transformative Growth piece. So the third piece of Transformative Growth is to increase the sophistication and investment in customer acquisition. We think we can and should be able to get new customers cheaper than we do today. There's lots of math we have around that. One of those is telematics, so we were the first out there with continuous telematics. We've been at it for over a decade. We're now taking telematics, and with Arity, we now think we can take telematics into new business, Brian. And actually, not have to have them download our app or put a device in their car to figure out how good a drive they are. We think we can use our sophisticated analytics to price them using telematics ahead of time, which will maybe -- to better manage your acquisition cost. So lots of work to go there, so plenty of opportunity to grow. Brian Meredith : Can I just -- one quick follow-up here. If I think of kind of going forward here, when you're looking at putting rate increases through for the remainder of the year, what's your kind of base case with respect to how you're thinking about inflation here? Are you assuming that the current inflationary environment in persisting through the remainder of 2023 as you're filing for rates? Tom Wilson : Let me finish and make sure we respect for people's time on that question. So first, when you look at overall inflation, the numbers Fed and everybody else sees, that's one set of numbers. If you look at the inflation in what we do, it's of course, dramatically higher. And those are subject to different things. So whether the Fed tightens the economy, it doesn't tighten economy, probably isn't going to do a lot to keep people from having severe accidents, hurting themselves and needing a lot of medical care or then more lawyers getting involved in the case, nor will it have a huge impact on what the OEs charge on parts. They tend to charge more in parts based on what they're doing to overall profitability and how many new cars are selling. So if we go into a recession, they sell new cars, I don't expect they're going to cut car's prices. So we think inflation will persist in this business at a higher level than you see from the overall CPI, and that's why we're having to raise prices for our customers. Tom Wilson : Thank you all for participating today. Thank you for being generous with your time. We're going a few minutes over. Our priorities, make sure we're going to make money in auto insurance and continue to leverage our superior position in homeowners as start to grow and execute Transformative Growth, whether that's by getting our costs down, rolling out new products, expanding our National General platform. And then we didn't spend any time today on the great stories we have in the lower oval, which is expanding Protection Services. So a lot of things we're working on hard to create more value for you. Thank you, and we'll see you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

After the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please limit your enquiry to one question and one follow-up. As a reminder, please be aware that today\u2019s call is being recorded. And now, I\u2019d like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Brent Vandermause, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Brent Vandermause : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we\u2019ll have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted related material on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement, and forward-looking statements about Allstate\u2019s operations. Allstate\u2019s results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2022 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Good morning. We appreciate you investing your time in Allstate. Let's start with an overview of results and then Mario and Jesse will walk through operating results and the actions being taken to increase shareholder value. Let's begin on Slide 2. Allstate's strategy has two components; increase personal profit liability market share, and expand protection services, which are shown in the two with on the left. On the right-hand side, you can see a summary of results for the second quarter. Progress is being made on the comprehensive plan to improve auto insurance profitability, which includes raising rates, reducing expenses, limiting growth and enhancing claim processes. While auto insurance margins are not at target levels, the proportion of premium associated with states operating and that underlying -- underwriting profit has gone from just under 30% in 2022 to 50% for the first half of this year. Mario will discuss the actions being taken to continue this trend and importantly, improved results in New York, New Jersey and California. Severe weather in the quarter contributed to a net loss of $1.4 billion, 42 catastrophe events impacted 160,000 customers and resulted in $2.7 billion of catastrophe losses and a property liability underwriting loss of $2.1 billion. Strong fixed income results from higher bond yields generated $610 million of investment income and Protection Services and Health and Benefits generated $98 million of profits in the quarter. The transformative growth plan to become the lowest cost protection provider is making continued progress. This both helps current results with lower costs and positions Allstate for sustainable growth when auto margins return to acceptable levels. Affordable, simple and connected property liability products with sophisticated telematics pricing and differentiated direct-to-consumer capabilities are being introduced under the Allstate brand through a new technology platform. National General was growing, which will also increase market share. Specialty auto expertise, along with leveraging auto\u2019s Allstate strength in preferred auto and homeowners insurance products are expected to drive sustainable growth. Allstate Protection Plans is expanding its embedded protection through new products and retail relationships and in international markets. Allstate has a strong capital position with $16.9 billion of statutory surplus and holding company assets, as Jesse will discuss later. And as you know, we have a long history of providing cash returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 3.9% of outstanding shares for $1.3 billion. We suspended this is repurchase program in July, as we had a net loss for the six months of the year. Improving profitability, increasing property liability, organic growth and broadening protection offered to customers through an extensive distribution platform will increase shareholder value. Let's review financial results on Slide 3. Revenues of $14 billion in the second quarter increased 14.4% above the prior year quarter of $1.8 billion. The increase was driven by higher average premiums in auto and homeowners insurance from rates taken in 2022 and 2023, resulting in property-liability earned premium growth of 9.6%. Net investment income of $610 million reflects the impact of higher fixed income yields and extended duration, which will substantially increase income. This growth more than offset a decline from performance-based investments in the quarter. The net loss of $1.4 billion and an adjusted net loss of $1.2 billion reflects a profit liability underwriting loss of $2.1 billion due to the $2.7 billion in catastrophe losses and increased auto insurance loss costs. In auto insurance, higher insurance pros and lower expenses were largely offset by higher catastrophe losses and increased claim frequency and severity. The underlying auto insurance combined ratio did improve slightly for the first six months of 2023 compared to the year-end 2022. Auto insurance had an underwriting loss of $678 million. In homeowners insurance, catastrophe losses were substantially over the 15-year average, resulting in a combined ratio of 145, generating an underwriting loss of $1.3 billion. The underlying combined ratio on homeowners improved 1.9 points to 67.6% as higher average premiums more than offset increased severity. Adjusted net income of $98 million from protection services and health and benefits when combined with the $610 million of investment income offset a portion of the underwriting loss. The target for enterprise adjusted net income return on equity remains at 14% to 17%. I'll now turn it over to Mario to discuss profit liability results. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Tom. Let's turn to Slide 4. We are seeing the impact of our comprehensive auto profit improvement plan in our financial results, starting with the rate increases we have implemented to date. The chart on the left shows Property-Liability earned premium increased 9.6% above the prior year quarter, driven by higher average premiums in auto and homeowners insurance, which were partially offset by a decline in policies in force. Price increases and cost reductions were largely offset by severe weather events and increased accident frequency and claim severity. The underwriting loss of $2.1 billion in the quarter was $1.2 billion worse than the prior year quarter due to the $1.6 billion increase in catastrophe losses. The chart on the right highlights the components of the combined ratio, including 22.6 points from catastrophe losses. Prior year reserve reestimates, excluding catastrophes, had a 1.6 point adverse impact on the combined ratio in the quarter. Of the $182 million of strengthening in the second quarter, $148 million was in National General, primarily driven by personal auto injury coverages in the 2022 accident year. In addition, prior years were strengthened by approximately $31 million for litigation activity in the state of Florida related to torque reform that was passed in March of this year. We've been closely monitoring the increase in filed suits on existing claims and the charge reflects a combination of higher legal defense costs and a modest loss reserve adjustment. Despite continuing pressure on the loss side, the underlying combined ratio of 92.9 improved modestly by 0.5 points compared to the prior year quarter and 0.4 points sequentially versus the first quarter of 2023. Now, let's move to slide five to discuss Allstate's auto insurance profitability in more detail. The second quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 108.3% was 0.4 points higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting higher catastrophe losses and increased current report year accident frequency and severity, which were largely offset by higher earned premium, expense reductions, and lower adverse non-catastrophe prior year reserve re-estimates. We continue to raise rates, reduce expenses, restrict growth, and enhanced claim processes as part of our comprehensive plan to improve auto insurance margins. This slide depicts the impact of our profit improvement actions on underlying auto insurance profitability trends. As a reminder, we continually assess claim severities as the year progresses. And last year, as 2022 developed, we continue to increase report year ultimate severity expectations. The chart on the left shows the quarterly underlying combined ratios from 2022 through the current quarter with 2022 quarters adjusted to account for full year average severity assumptions, which removes the effect that intra-year severity changes had on recorded quarterly results. After adjusting for the timing of higher severity expectations, the quarterly underlying combined ratio trend was essentially flat throughout 2022. As we move into 2023, the underlying combined ratio has improved modestly in each of the first two quarters, reflecting both the impact of our profitability actions and the continued persistently high levels of loss cost inflation. The chart on the right depicts the percent change at annualized average earned premium shown by the blue line and the average underlying loss and expense per policy shown by the light blue bars compared to prior year-end. Rapid increases in claim severity and higher accident frequency since mid-2021, resulted in significant increases in the underlying loss and expense per policy which outpaced the change in average earned premium and drove a higher underlying combined ratio in both 2021 and 2022. As we've implemented rate increases, the annualized earned premium trend line continues to increase and has begun to outpace the still elevated underlying cost per policy in the first two quarters of 2023, resulting in a modest improvement in the underlying combined ratio. Slide six provides an update on the execution of our comprehensive approach to increase returns in auto insurance. There are four areas of focus; raising rates, reducing expenses, implementing underwriting actions, and enhancing claim practices to manage loss costs. Starting with rates, you remember the Allstate brand implemented 16.9% of rate in 2022. In the first six months of 2023, we have implemented an additional 7.5% across the book, including 5.8% in the second quarter. National General implemented rate increases of 10% in 2022, an additional 5.5% through the first six months of 2023. We will continue to pursue rate increases in 2023 to restore auto insurance margins back to the mid-90s target levels. Reducing operating expenses is core to transformative growth, and we also temporarily reduced advertising to reflect the lower appetite for new business. We continue to have more restrictive underwriting actions on new business in locations and risk segments where we have not yet achieved adequate prices for the risk, but are beginning to selectively remove these restrictions in states and segments that are achieving target margins. To this point, the number of states achieving an underlying combined ratio better than 100 increased from 23 states, which represented just under 30% of Allstate brand auto insurance premium at the end of 2022 and to 36 states, representing approximately 50% of premium at the end of the second quarter. Ensuring that our claim practices are operating effectively and enhancing those practices where necessary, is key to delivering customer value, particularly in this high inflation environment. This includes modifying claim processes in both physical damage and injury coverages by doing things like increasing resources, expanding reinspections and accelerating the settlement of injury claims to mitigate the risk of continued loss development. We are also negotiating improved vendor service and parts agreements to offset some of the inflation associated with repairing vehicles. Slide 7 provides an update on progress in three large states with a disproportionate impact on profitability. The table on the left provides rate increases either implemented so far this year are currently pending with the respective insurance department in California, New York and New Jersey. Because our current prices are not adequate to cover our costs in these states, we have had to take actions to restrict new business volumes. As a result, new issued applications from the combination of California, New York and New Jersey declined by approximately 62% compared to the prior year quarter. In California, we implemented a second 6.9% rate increase in April and also filed for a 35% increase in the second quarter that is currently pending with the Department of Insurance. We continue to work closely with the California Department to secure approval of this filing and restore auto rates to an adequate level. In New York, we implemented approximately three points of weighted rate in June, driven by approved increases in two closed companies. And subsequently received approval for a 6.7% increase in the larger open companies, which was implemented in July, we will continue to make further filings in 2023 that will be additive to their -- to the rates approved so far this year. In New Jersey, we received approval for a 6.9% rate increase in the first quarter and filed a subsequent 29% increase in the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, we anticipate implementing additional rate increases for the balance of 2023 to counteract persistent loss cost increases. Slide 8 dives deeper into how we are improving customer value through expense reductions. The chart on the left shows the property liability underwriting expense ratio and highlights drivers of the 2.5 point improvement in the second quarter compared to the prior year quarter. The first green bar shows the 1.4 point impact from advertising spend, which has been temporarily reduced, given a more limited appetite for new business. The second green bar shows the decline in operating costs, mainly driven by lower agent and employee-related costs and the impact of higher premiums relative to fixed costs. Shifting to our longer-term trend on the right, we remain committed to reducing the adjusted expense ratio as part of transformative growth. This metric starts with our underwriting expense ratio, excluding restructuring, coronavirus-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and advertising. It then adds in our claims expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims because catastrophe-related costs tend to fluctuate. Through innovation and strong execution, we've driven significant improvement with a second quarter adjusted expense ratio of 24.7%. We expect to drive additional improvement, achieving an adjusted expense ratio of approximately 23 by year-end 2024, which represents a 6-point reduction compared to our starting point in 2018. While increasing average premiums certainly represent a tailwind, our intent in establishing the goal is to become more price competitive. This requires a sustainable improvement in our cost structure with our future focus on three primary areas, including enhancing digitization and automation capabilities, improving operating efficiency through outsourcing, business model rationalization and centralized support and enabling higher growth distribution at lower cost through changes in agency compensation structure and new agent models. Now, let's move to slide 9 to review homeowner insurance results, which despite improving underlying performance, incurred an underwriting loss in the quarter driven by elevated catastrophe losses. Our business model incorporates a differentiated product, underwriting, reinsurance and claims ecosystem that is unique in the industry. Our approach has consistently generated industry-leading underwriting results despite quarterly or yearly fluctuations in catastrophe losses. Our homeowners insurance combined ratio, including the impact of catastrophes, has outperformed the industry by 12 points from 2017 through 2022. During that same time period, we generated annual average underwriting income of approximately $650 million. The chart on the left shows key Allstate Protection homeowners insurance operating statistics for the quarter. Net written premium increased 12.4% from the prior year quarter, predominantly driven by higher average gross premium per policy in both the Allstate and National General brands and a 1% increase in policies in force. Allstate brand average gross written premium per policy increased by 13.2% compared to the prior year quarter driven by implemented rate increases throughout 2022 and an additional 7.4 points implemented through the first six months of 2023 as well as inflation in insured home replacement costs. While the second quarter homeowners combined ratio is typically higher than full year results, primarily due to seasonally high severe weather-related catastrophe losses, the second quarter of 2023 combined ratio of 145.3% was among the highest in Allstate's history and increased by 37.8 points compared to last year's second quarter due to a 40.3 point increase in the catastrophe loss ratio. The underlying combined ratio of 67.6% improved by 1.9 points compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher earned premium, lower frequency and a lower expense ratio, partially offset by higher severity. The chart on the right provides a historical perspective on the second quarter property liability catastrophe loss ratio of 75.9 points, which was elevated compared to historical experience, reflecting an increased number of catastrophe events and larger losses per event. While the second quarter result was 33.9 points above the 15-year second quarter average of 42 points, it is not unprecedented and filled within modeled outcomes contemplated in our economic capital framework. We remain confident in our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns in the homeowners business and continue to respond to loss trends by implementing rate increases to address higher repair costs and limiting exposures in geographies where we cannot achieve adequate returns for our shareholders. And now I'll hand it over to Jesse to discuss the remainder of our results. Jesse Merten : Thank you, Mario. I'd like to start on Slide 10, which covers results for our Protection Services and Health and Benefits businesses. The chart on the left shows Protection Services where we continue to broaden the protection provided to an increasing number of customers largely through embedded distribution programs. Revenues in these businesses, excluding the impact of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives increased 9.1% to $686 million in the second quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Increase reflects growth in Allstate Protection Plans and Allstate Dealer Services, partially offset by a decline in parity. By leveraging the Allstate brand, excellent customer service and expanded products and partnerships with leading retailers, Allstate Protection Plans continues to generate profitable growth, resulting in an 18% increase in the second quarter compared to the prior year quarter. In the table below the chart, you will see that adjusted net income of $41 million in the second quarter decreased $2 million compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher appliance and furniture claims severity and a higher mix of lower-margin business as we invest in growth at Allstate Protection Plans. We'll continue to invest in these businesses, which provide an attractive opportunity to broaden distribution protection offerings that meet customers' needs and create value for shareholders. Shifting to the chart on the right, Health and Benefits continues to provide stable revenues while protecting more than four million policyholders. Revenues of $575 million in the second quarter of 2023 increased by $2 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by an increase in premiums, contract charges and other revenues in group health, which was partially offset by a reduction in individual health and employer voluntary benefits. Health and Benefits continues to make progress on rebuilding core operating systems to drive down costs, improve the customer experience and support growth that generates shareholder value. Adjusted net income of $57 million in the second quarter of 2023 decreased $10 million, compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to the decline in employer voluntary benefits, individual health and higher expenses related to system investments. Now let's move to Slide 11 to discuss investment results and portfolio positioning. Active portfolio management includes comprehensive monitoring of economic conditions, market opportunities, enterprise risk and return and capital, as well as interest rates and credit spreads by rating, sector and individual name. As you'll recall, last year, exposure to below investment grade bonds in public equity was reduced. We maintained this portfolio allocation in the second quarter, which enabled us to extend duration of the fixed income portfolio and increased market-based income levels. As shown in the chart on the left, net investment income totaled $610 million in the quarter, which was $48 million above the second quarter of last year. Market-based income of $536 million, shown in blue was $168 million above the prior year quarter, reflecting repositioning of the fixed income portfolio into longer duration and higher yielding assets that sustainably increased income. Market-based income has also benefited from higher yields for short-term investments in floating rate assets, such as bank loans. Performance-based income of $127 million shown in black, was $109 million below the prior year quarter due to lower valuation increases and fewer sales of underlying assets. Our performance-based portfolio is expected to enhance long-term returns and volatility on these assets from quarter-to-quarter as expected. The chart on the right shows the fixed income earned yield continues to rise and was 3.6% at quarter end compared to 2.8% for the prior year quarter and 3.4% in the first quarter of 2023. This chart also shows that from the fourth quarter of 2021 through the third quarter of 2022, lowering fixed income duration mitigated losses as rates rose. Beginning in Q4 of 2022, we began to extend duration, which locks in higher yields for longer. In the second quarter, we further extended duration to 4.4 years, increasing from 4 years in the first quarter. Our fixed income portfolio yield is still below the current intermediate corporate bond yield of approximately 5.5%, reflecting an additional opportunity to increase yields. To close, I'd like to turn to Slide 12 to discuss how Allstate proactively manages capital to provide the financial flexibility, liquidity and capital resources necessary to navigate the challenging operating environment. Capital management is based on a sophisticated framework that quantifies capital targets by business, product, geography, investment type and for the overall enterprise. Targets include a base level of capital for expected volatility and earnings as well as additional capital for stress events, situations where correlations between risks are higher than modeled and other contingencies. This model enables us to proactively manage capital in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Utilization of reinsurance, both by event and in aggregate is assessed relative to overall enterprise risk levels. A robust reinsurance program is in place with multiyear contracts to mitigate losses from large catastrophes. Homeowners insurance geographic exposures are managed to generate appropriate risk-adjusted returns, including lowering exposure to California and Florida property markets. This framework was used to decide to purchase additional aggregate program coverage this year. Reducing high-yield bonds and public equities in the investment portfolio significantly reduced the amount of enterprise capital required for investments. This decision was based on market conditions and the decline in auto profitability as well as the desire to reduce volatility and statutory results. It also provides a sustainable source of increased income in capital generation. The decline in auto insurance profitability is also captured by our framework, which increased capital requirements for auto insurance from pre-pandemic levels to reflect recent results. The capital management framework ensures Allstate has the financial flexibility, liquidity and capital resources necessary to operate in challenging environments and be positioned for growth. Allstate's capital position is sound with estimated statutory surplus and holding company assets totaling $16.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, as shown on the table to the left. Holding company assets of $3.3 billion represent approximately 2.5x our annual fixed charges with no debt maturities for the remainder of 2023 and a modest amount maturing in 2024. Senior debt and preferred stock refinancing in the first and second quarters of this year demonstrate our ability to readily access capital markets to address maturities as they arise. In response to the loss this quarter, we have suspended share repurchases under the $5 billion authorization, which is 90% complete. This authorization expires in March of 2024. In addition to having a strong capital base, Allstate has a history of generating capital and statutory net income in our largest underwriting company, Allstate Insurance Company, as you can see on the chart on the right. Statutory net income averaged $1.9 billion annually in the 10 years prior to the onset of COVID. You can also see the impact of the rapid increase in auto insurance claim severity and recent catastrophe loss experience on 2022 and 2023 statutory net income. We're confident that the auto insurance profit improvement plan will restore profitability. The homeowner's insurance business is designed to generate underwriting profits, and proactive investment management will create additional capital to grow market share, expand protection offerings and provide cash return to shareholders. Allstate will continue to proactively manage capital to navigate the current operating environment and be well positioned for growth to increase its shareholder value. With that as context, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Certainly, one moment for our first question. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please. Gregory Peters : Well, good morning, everyone. I guess, I'm going to focus on auto insurance profitability for my first question. And obviously, there's a bunch of slides in your presentation, the one where you identified the three states. I guess from a bigger picture perspective, though, -- do you have updated views on frequency and severity for the second half of this year or for next year versus what you were thinking at the beginning of the year I guess what I'm ultimately getting is how much more rate do we need to get that underlying combined ratio number that you use on the slide 6 -- excuse me, slide 5 to get it down to the low to mid-90s. Tom Wilson : Greg, this is Tom. Let me start, and then Mario can jump in. First, as it relates to frequency and severity, of course, it's hard to predict what's going to happen in the second half of the year. What we do know is that the severity was increased in the second -- first half of this year from what we thought it would be when we looked at it last year. So we're really glad we took the rates that we did, and we've been accelerating rates, as Mario talked about. I think when you look at it, it's really -- of course, it's hard to predict, right? What you're really looking at is that slide that Mario showed that had the line with the average premiums going up and then the bar with the severities and you want that line to be above the bar, of course. What you know going forward is that the line is going to keep going up, right? Like we filed those rates, we've got those rates. We put them in the computer, we're collecting the cash. And so you know that's going to happen. What you don't know is whether severity will go up from the 11% or whether it will be down from the 11%. It's come down this year from last year. We'd like to think that all the work we're doing will have it come down even further. And so that gap will get you back to the mid-90s that we talked about in terms of targeted combined ratio. When that exactly happens, of course, is dependent on what happens to the second bar, which is not known. What we do know is we'll continue to take increased rates and make that line continue to go up. Mario, any specifics you want to add on the three states that you mentioned or? Mario Rizzo : I think, Greg, the thing I'd add is less about to Tom's point, what we expect going forward and more about what we're seeing and maybe just give you a little more color underneath the loss cost trend. So as you remember, last quarter, we started giving you pure premium trends as opposed to coverage specific frequency and severity because we just think it's a better way for you to evaluate where overall profitability is going. And the point I'd make is if you look on Slide 5, as Tom pointed out, for the first couple of quarters this year, we've seen the average earned premium trend begin to outpace the increases in loss and expense. It's hard to predict what the future will hold, but that's an encouraging development. Underneath that loss trend, if you look at where we're at in the second quarter compared to where we were for the full year last year, the increase in pure premium is about 12.5%, and we told you that severity is up on average across all coverages by about 11%. So what we're seeing still is persistently high severity across coverages with a lesser impact from overall frequency increases. The point being we're going to continue to aggressively implement our profit improvement plan, you've seen what we've done with rates. We've done 7.5 points through the first half of this year in the Allstate brand, 5.5 points on National General. We're going to continue to do that. You see the benefit that the cost reductions is having on the combined ratio while that rate earns in. And we've talked a lot about those three states, which make up about one-quarter of our book, California, New York and New Jersey. We want to keep pushing on continuing to drive rate increases into the book. We've gotten some approvals so far this year, but there's rates pending, pretty significant rates pending in California and New Jersey, and we're prepared to file another rate in New York. So we're going to keep pushing really hard on that. And in the meantime, we've scaled way back on new business production in those states. And while it's having a reasonably small impact on the loss ratio so far this year, because new business just tends to be a smaller proportion of our overall book, it will continue to have a favorable impact on our loss ratio going forward. And until we get to adequate rates in those three states, we're going to keep restricting the volume of business we're willing to write. Gregory Peters : Okay. Thanks for the color. Maybe just keeping on auto as my follow-up question on NatGen, you spoke about the reserve strengthening in the quarter, and I guess you also mentioned Florida in your comments. Can you give us any perspective on the reserve strengthening that happened inside NatGen? Is it a true-up and that you're comfortable where the trends are with matching reserves at this point in time, or is this going to be another situation where we have a couple of quarters of catch-up that we're having to deal with? Tom Wilson : Mario can answer how we feel about the growth and the profitability of the growth in National General, Greg, let me just settle up context. So first, the acquisition of National General is exceeding our expectations. As, you know, we bought the company so that we could consolidate our Encompass business into it that would reduce the cost and create a stronger business that we're serving independent agents. We like what we got there. The consolidation and the cost reductions are exceeding our expectations. And that was the basis under which we agreed to where the economics of the acquisition made at. The upside from there was growing in the IA channel, both through the specialty vehicle product and by building new products for preferred auto and homeowners insurance using Allstate's expertise, both of which are also becoming reality. Mario, do you want to talk about, I guess, both reserves. But I think Greg's underlying question there was like you're growing, is that a good thing? Mario Rizzo : Yes. So, Greg, the place I'd start with National General, you're right. We're growing in National General that's principally in the specialty vehicle or the non-standard auto part of the business, which that market continues to experience pretty significant disruption. A couple of things I'd say on NatGen. First of all, the underlying combined ratio in the quarter was 96%, and 96% is slightly higher than we want to run it at, but it's pretty close to our target margin. And that 96% includes the kind of roll-forward impact of increasing reserves principally in the 2022 accident year and therefore, increasing our loss expectations in the 2023 year. So, that's all embedded in the 96%. A couple of things in addition to that, that I mentioned. We've talked a lot about the profit improvement plan, we're implementing that same approach in that same plan in National General across the same levers we're using in the Allstate brand. We've taken 5.5 points of rate this year, 11 points of rate over the last 12 months in NatGen. And given that it's predominantly a non-standard auto book, the book tends to turn over and get repriced pretty rapidly. So, we're comfortable that the rate we've taken so far this year is working its way into the system. And I would say in response to a higher loss trend that we've seen in 2023, we've accelerated our plan to take rate in 2023. So, we're ahead of that 5.5 points is ahead of where we expected to be at this point during the year. We've also restricted underwriting guidelines in a number of states, we're writing more liability-only less full coverage. So, we're being really selective about what we're writing. And the other benefit, as Tom mentioned, part of the rationale around acquiring National General was the opportunity to lower costs and improve the expense ratio, and we're benefiting from that inside that 96% underlying combined ratio. We've seen a pretty significant improvement year-over-year in the underwriting expense ratio as we essentially take advantage of scale through the growth we're getting. So, comfortable where we're positioned. We're taking the appropriate actions from a profitability perspective. And so we're comfortable with what we're writing in NatGen right now. Gregory Peters : Got it. Thank you for the detail and your answers. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your question please. Josh Shanker : Thank you very much for taking my question. Yes. Tom, there's the amount of rate that you need and the amount that you can get over a certain period of time, but when you look back to the beginning of the year and you had your plan for taking rates and you've learned about some changes in frequency and severity over the past six, seven months. Has that changed the perspective on how much rate you need and want to ask for? And does that change the 2023 plan, or does that mean that the regulators will give you only so much and you have get that rate in 2024 and beyond? Tom Wilson : Of course, it's -- I would say, Josh, it's a good question, but I would say it's not like not like every quarter or every 6 months, we adapt it is like every day. So Mario and Guy are constantly looking at our pricing, and we're going to maximum file rates everywhere we can, and we're not getting as much pushback from goes because the numbers are pretty clear. Like it's not like we're making it up, you pay for the cars and they see the cash go out so you -- and they do have to pay attention to what the rules are in the rating. Now we have 3 states, which are a problem, and we're working aggressively with them. so that we can get the right amount of it. But yes, so our -- the rate expectation for the year has gone up from the beginning of the year. And it will keep going up until we get to our target combined ratio. We have -- we've talked about some of the issues we have in some of those states, you see us agreeing to lower amounts than we actually need because the time value of money and the multiplication works for you. So why take a 6.9 when you need 35 in California because you can get 6.9 right away as opposed you could wait 18 months to get 35. So we've we're very sophisticated and have good relationships with them, so we can manage it so that it meets our needs. So and we'll just keep rate that's on auto, which I assume where you're going, Josh. Same thing applies in homeowners and our price increases are up a little bit, but not up as much as what we thought they were going to be. but they're still from where we set out where we thought would be in the beginning. Mario, add anything you would add? A \u2013 Mario Rizzo : Yes. Just a couple of additional data points, Josh. As Tom mentioned, our data is immediately -- our indications are immediately responsive to the data we're seeing. So we're constantly updating rate indications and filing for what we need based on what we're actually experiencing versus what we thought we would have needed going into the year. And the other point I'd make is, and this is on a couple of the states that we've spiked out for you. We're evaluating trade-offs and leaning in where we think it just makes sense. So for example, in California, got the 2 6.9% rate and we turned around and filed for essentially our full indication at 35, knowing that, that was likely to require a longer review period. There was a little more risk there, but we thought it was the right thing to do. In New Jersey, we did the same thing. We got the 6.9% rate approved, which is essentially the cap that the state hold you to, but then we opted to utilize an administrative provision and file for a 29% rate. So again, we're aggressively pushing on the amount of rate we need based on the loss experience where we've got in real time. And we're going to keep doing that. and keep pushing rate through and working with all the departments and each of the regulators to get those rates approved as quickly as we can to continue to bend the line on that loss trend. Q \u2013 Joshua Shanker : And outside of the 3 problem states, when you are submitting the filing, does the filing need to be audit financial statements or financial data in arrears, or can you pretty much file new rate with current data as it's coming into the systems? A \u2013 Mario Rizzo : Yes. I mean for filing used state, certainly, we're filing based on current data as opposed to relying on prior year-end or any of that information. So what we're doing is, Josh, is reacting to the loss trends we're seeing incorporating that into the filing, and that's what kept submitted. Josh Shanker : Okay. Thank you for the answers to the question. Operator : One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question, I wanted to go back to the capital discussion and the decision you guys made to pull the buyback program. Can you just give us a sense of what you're looking for when you return to buybacks? I sense maybe some of this is also dependent going into wind season, right, which could bring additional cat losses to Allstate and you guys are still working on improving the profitability of your auto business. So what would you need to see to turn back on the buyback at some point next year? Tom Wilson : Elyse, let me start macro and then ask Jesse to maybe dig in even a little more. I know you spend a lot of time on capital, so we can help you show you what we believe to be true. First, we have a long history of proactive managing capital, whether that's how we deploy it at the individual risk level or what we do with different investments, as Jesse talked about, whether it's selling businesses like life and annuities or using alternative capital like reinsurance or cat bonds or providing cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As you point out, I think if you look at the Q, we bought back about $37 billion of stock since we went public. And so that's because we're -- we got good math, which Jesse will talk about, and we do a proactively. I think the suspending the share repurchase we just sound judgment. If you're not making money, don't buy shares back. It's really not a lot more complicated than that. I mean, it obviously helps you preserve capital, but just sort of good logic always serves the right kind of capital plan, which is you got to make money to be buying shares back. Jesse, do you want to talk about maybe give at least some more specifics on this whole capital? Jesse Merten : Yes. Good morning, Elyse. I think to build on Tom's point, and I think it's easiest to just think about not the specific question, but more how we think about capital management more broadly. So you focus as many others do on RBC. RBC is a great measure for insurance companies, it's common. We look at it as well. So we certainly understand why there's a focus at times on RBC. It's a measure that served the industry well in good times and in bad times. But I think as you know, RBC has some limitations. So we use it as an input in our capital management process, but not a primary driver, right? RBC is focused on statutory legal entities, but it doesn't incorporate the risk across the enterprise or correlation in those types of risks. It doesn't include sources of capital outside of regulated entities. Protection plans would be an example there. But those aspects are important to our overall capital management framework. eyes: Now that capital is all available to us and our comprehensive and more precise capital management framework considers those facets. So -- and I think it's important to go back to really how we're managing capital through what we consider to be a very detailed and sophisticated economic capital framework that quantifies enterprise risk and establishes our targets. As we've talked, that includes inputs from regulatory capital models, rating agencies and then our own risk models to help to quantify stress events, and we built those models really off of their risk models that are used to regulate banks. We feel very good about the output of our overall economic capital model. So we use that then as we've discussed, to determine a level of base capital that we need to operate our business while continuing to meet customer needs and amounts that are well above triggering any regulatory involvement. So you've got base capital. On top of that, we hold stress capital for unexpected on frequent outcomes. And then we have a contingent reserve that we use and included in our target capital range, that's really meant to incorporate extreme stress events, extreme low frequency events and just basically things that are beyond the standard probabilities that we apply to our stressed capital calculations. So high catastrophes this quarter used some of the contingent capital reserve, but we continue to hold stress capital that's above our base capital level, and we remain confident in our capital position and our ability to execute on strategy, we look ahead. I think your question gets to the future, right? So I wanted to build a base for reminding everyone how we think about it. But as we look to the future, it's more than just a question of the buybacks, it's what is their capital perspective look like. And we continue to believe we're well capitalized even if it takes longer than we expect to get auto profitability back to targeted levels and even if catastrophes come in at more expected levels, for the rest of the year in 2023. Even at more normal levels of catastrophes for the rest of the year, 2023 will be the highest year for catastrophe losses on a pure dollar basis in about 25 years. So it's a high cap quarter. We continue to feel good about capital, liquidity is not an issue, as we've talked about. We have a strong source of cash through interest payments and maturities that come over the next 12 months, and we have about $5 billion that comes off the portfolio that selling everything in the next 12 months, and we have a highly liquid investment portfolio. We also have a number of capital options that we're continuously evaluating given our proactive approach to capital management, as Tom mentioned. So that includes additional reinsurance options that could allow us to lower the volatility of our earnings at an attractive cost of capital, and we continue to look at those things. I think we've also proven in the last couple of quarters, we have open access to financial markets where we showed that through our -- some of our refinancing activity. So we have a lot of options. I want to kind of close out with -- as it relates to capital options and capital strength, issuing common stock at this point is not something that we're considering. It's not an option that's on the table given how we feel about our overall capital position. So maybe that -- I know it's more than just when you're going to turn back on buybacks. But I want to -- I think the context around how we think about capital management is more important to how we might answer that question in the future. So hopefully, that was helpful. Elyse Greenspan : That was helpful. And then maybe just one more, right? You did mention reinsurance and some other options that you have. And you did make -- you did in the first quarter, right, you choose to monetize part of your equity portfolio. Is it safe to assume that you think about prospect going forward on the capital side, you're not looking to make any significant changes to investments? And on the same thinking about your current businesses, you're not -- you wouldn't be thinking about monetizing any assets as a way to free up capital? Tom Wilson : Elyse, so on the investment side, that decision was primarily made from a risk and return standpoint, first starting at the markets. And we thought -- when we made the decision, we thought there is greater opportunity to make money by lengthening duration than by staying in equities. It had the benefit of reducing the volatility of equities. And in our models, the capital charges for equities is a lot higher the bot. So it has that capital benefit. If we felt like the time was right to go back long in public equities, then we would look at it at the time and then we'd say, okay, how much capital do we have and how do we feel about it? But we don't have a date in mind for that. I think when you just look at the economic environment, it's somewhat balanced. Jesse Merten : And I think as it relates to monetizing assets, Elyse, in that component of the question. I think we certainly understand all the range of options but we don't believe we're in a position right now where we have to be considering things like monetizing assets to bolster capital. Again, we feel good about our capital position. We have options in place, and we understand the full range of options of what we could do in the event we believe that we had a need. Tom Wilson : We have the capital to make our strategy is, of course, the way we're going to increase shareholder value. One, get profit up. Two, get growth up. And three, broaden the portfolio, which those lands to will lead to a higher multiple, and that's what we're trying to drive to. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks for all the color. Operator : Thank you, one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski from BMO. Your question, please. Michael Zaremski : I guess, my first is a quick follow-up on the capital discussion, you said bolstering capital. So I just want to clarify, you reiterated the 14% to 17% ROE targets, which I believe you've been talking about since I believe 2019 could be prior looking at my notes. It seems like there's a disconnect, though, because the shareholders' equity levels ex OCI are down meaningfully since 2019. There's an element of where -- it seems like this is why this company is coming up, investors are expecting that the consensus ROEs look like they're well above the 14% to 17% because people aren't bolstering their capital assumptions, I guess, in the model. So I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this correctly. It's 14% to 17% is still the target. And so we directionally should be making sure we don't turn on the buyback until Cereal's equity levels are bolstered a bit. Tom Wilson : So first, the 14% to 17% confirmation was just really our way saying we don't see anything that diminishes the ultimate earning power of the company. What the equity base is and what the earnings are, of course, but we -- so we're really just trying to say we don't see anything that diminishes the earning power of the building company. We never said it was a cap. And as I just mentioned, our strategy is really get returns up to where they've been historically, which will increase shareholder value. And then the big differential we have versus progressive and others is we need higher growth to drive the multiple of and we're going to get that two ways to increase market share, personal profit liability to transformative growth. And then secondly, by expanding our protection offerings, which will drive the multiple up. So it's like step 1, step 2. We think they can both hit at the same time, to be honest, but that's what we're driving to. Michael Zaremski : Okay. That's okay. That's very helpful. My last question is just thinking through all the actions you're taking in terms of expense ratio, pulling back in certain states. I guess it seems clear that in the near term, we should be thinking about PIF [ph] growth remaining under pressure. I'm just curious, too, is that one the right way to think about it? And two, is there -- for your capital model, does PIF growth being negative with total revenue growth still being very positive because of pricing power? Is it -- does it help that you're shrinking PIF, but growing top line because of pricing, or is every dollar of growth still seems the revenue still seem the same way within your capital model? Tom Wilscon : Capital models are really driven on risk, which are tied to premium. So PIF doesn't really impact it. So -- which is the right economically, we believe the right way to do it. In terms of growth, we think we can -- Mario talked about growth in National General. We talked about growth in 50% of the markets were working there. When those 3 states that we need higher prices on get to the right level, we can grow there as we continue to roll out transformative growth and we'll be in -- we expect to be in 10 states with our new product this year, which will just be in the states and that we drive a lot of growth. but we're using machine-based learning some really cool direct stuff. So we think there's plenty of opportunity to grow. And so we're not concerned about it. The reason we're reducing the growth in those states like if you're not making any money, it doesn't make sense to sell it. Like I don't really understand the logic of we're losing money. Let's go out and spend a bunch of money to get business, and we'll continue to lose money until we can raise the prices later. That just raises your -- if you include those losses in your acquisition cost, it's hard to make the lifetime value work. So we chose not to write the business it's not quite really, as Mario said, it's not really a combined ratio impact. It's just like why do something that's uneconomic. Michael Zaremski : Understood Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your questions please. Alex Scott : Hi. First one I had is on the prior year development. One of the things we noticed from last quarter was just that I think 2022 accident year actually looked like it developed favorably and 2021 was still a bit unfavorable. And I guess I'm just interested what was the mix of that this quarter? And how do we think about sort of the speed up of kind of reaching settlements to reduce volatility on some of the older claims and the impact that's having? And where are you in the process of doing that? Like is there still a good amount of wood to chop there? Have you sort of, gone through the 2021 claims to the extent you're going to do it already. Just any color around all that to help us think through what development could look like through the rest of the year? A \u2013 Jesse Merten : And I'll take that quickly. I think the first thing I would highlight is that the development this quarter was related to National General, so a little bit different than what we went through last year. And we don't separately disclose which prior years, it's attributable to. But it's safe to say -- given the nature of that business, some of the near and years, we continually, Alex, move reserves between years and coverages and prior year reserves and coming up with these estimates. And so it's safe to say that we're really focused on settling -- getting some of those older claims settled, getting the reserves right. And, sort of, again, I'm a broken record on this, but getting the aggregate reserve recorded properly. So this was really -- again, this was -- this quarter is certainly a story of the National General reserve levels. And the movement between prior years and coverage is just normal course this quarter. Alex Scott : Got it. Thanks. And the second one I had is just a follow-up on, there was a comment earlier related to, I think it was the 35% filing where it was mentioned that, that can take up to 18 months. I mean that one, I think, was filed in late May. So that would suggest would be like all the way towards the end of 2024, if I just take that comment at face value as to like when you potentially get the California approval. I'm just trying to weigh thinking through that versus some of the comments that suggested the regulatory environment may be getting a little better, I mean that seems like a pretty long time line. Can you help us think through and maybe I'm just trying to take that a little to cut and dry? Tom Wilson : I think I'm probably the one that said 18 months that was not to imply that we think it's right to wait 18 months or it should take 18 months. We just said sometimes it takes a long time, the California department stayed on all rate increases for a couple of years. They're not in that mode anymore, and we're working actively with them because they know that's not a good place to be and it doesn't create a good market. So I think what you can do is just look at the monthly numbers we've put out on rate increases. You can factor that in. You can -- we've given some math on how it rolls into the P&L. And that will give you a good look 12 months forward at what that blue line is that Mario talked about and at what rate is going up. They will tell you what's going to come in. And then you can make your own judgment on what you think severity and frequency will be. Alex Scott : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for clarifying. Brent Vandermause : Hey, Jonathan, we\u2019ll take one more question. Operator : Certainly. One moment for our final question then. And our final question for today comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Your question please. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for first allowing me in here. I want to go back to the capital question and the decision to stop the buybacks, if I may. And Tom, I'm certainly -- I appreciate the thought of it doesn't really make sense to buy back stock when we're generating a loss. That said, I think we have seen about $2 billion of buybacks since I think, the second quarter of last year in a loss environment. I think everything you're showing on -- and presenting in the slides would suggest that we are hopefully inflecting in the auto margins. I think even a quarter ago, you were still talking about over $4 billion of holdco liquidity. So I'd just love to better understand what changed or shifted in the thinking here to make you decide to stop here, especially when stock seems to be attractively valued relative to previous buybacks? Tom Wilson : Let me go back to the genesis of the buyback program and then roll it forward. So it was a $5 billion program, about $3 billion of which was because we're returning capital that was generated by sale of the life and annuity businesses. So it was really a $2 billion net program. We tended to have that program -- that buyback program was usually sized by how much money we made the prior year and we weren't using in growth. So it was in arrears kind of share repurchase program. And that's how we got to $5 billion. So we're 90% of the way there on $5 billon, we couldn't complete it, for sure, and we just decided you're losing money, don't buy stock back. It's just sometimes good capital management is just a common sense as opposed to a specific formula because it's formulas change, correlations change and all that sort of stuff. So from our standpoint, it was really no more complicated. I mean, Jess and I talked for like five minutes were like, okay, another quarter of a loss. A lot of -- lot catastrophes are a lot higher, almost two standard deviations away. We factored that in when we decided on the $5 billion. We factored that in when we looked at last year, keeping the program going. And it was a sensitivity, but it was a sensitivity, not a reality when insurance into a reality, you say, okay, let's just stop buying it back. And if we feel like getting back to it, we will. And we have a strong track record of buying stock back, but what will drive the value of our stock, and I can close on this is not share repurchases. Like we've looked at share repurchases. As I said, we bought $37 billion back. The return on share repurchases, if you take the price that you bought it at and the price of the stock at any point in time. Of course, it varies like it's cheap now, in my opinion. And so it would be good to buyback. But when you look at it over an extended period of time, it kind of turns into the cost of capital, which makes some sense. Sometimes you get a 20% return because you buyback cheap and the stock went on to run. Sometimes you buy it and it stacks up and you get lower return. But when you look at it over a long period of time, so you don't really create shareholder value by doing share buybacks. If you don't do share buybacks, you destroy shareholder value. That's a bad thing. But -- so the way we're going to create shareholder value is get profitability up, execute transformer growth and broaden our -- the product offering to people and things like protection plans, which are low capital, high growth, high-return businesses, health and benefits in the same way. So that's our plan. We look -- thank you for tuning in this quarter, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Thank you for standing by and welcome to Allstate's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Brent Vandermause, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Brent Vandermause : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted related material on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and our strategy. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2022 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Good morning. We appreciate your investment in time in Allstate. Let's start with an overview of results and then Mario and Jess will walk through our operating performance. Let's begin on Slide 2. So our strategy's 2 components : increase personal Property-Liability market share. And expand protection provided to customers which are shown in the 2 over on the left. On the right-hand side, you can see the highlights for the quarter. We made good progress on improving auto insurance profitability. There is more to be done but you can see the improving trend again this quarter. We decided to pursue our sale of Allstate's Health and Benefits businesses. After successful integration of Allstate's voluntary benefits business, with National General's group and individual health businesses, we've created a really well-positioned benefits platform and that strategy was part of the National General acquisition plan. Our success now positions us to achieve additional growth that potential could be maximized by aligning this platform with a broader set of complementary products, distribution channels and capabilities. We anticipate completing a transaction in 2024. We also made progress in executing and transformative growth initiatives to set the stage for personal profit liability market share growth as margins improve. The second part of our strategy to broaden protection offerings also progressed with Allstate Protection Plans growth. Let's review the financial results on Slide 3. Revenues of $14.5 billion in the third quarter increased 9.8% above the prior year at $1.3 billion. The increase was driven by higher property liability earned premiums in auto and homeowners insurance, primarily reflecting the 2022 and 2023 rate increases. Which has resulted in Property-Liability earned premium growth of 10%. Net investment income of $689 million reflects proactive portfolio actions, including extending fixed income duration and lowering public equity holdings to take advantage of higher fixed income yields. Net loss of $41 million and adjusted net income of $214 million that's $0.81 per diluted share reflects improved profit liability underwriting performance. Property-Liability recorded an underwriting loss of $414 million which compares to $1.3 billion loss in the third quarter of 2022. While the improvement was encouraging, loss cost trends remain elevated and require continued execution of auto insurance profit improvement plan, particularly in California, New York and New Jersey. Slide 4 provides an update on the execution of the 4 components of that plan. Starting with rates; the Allstate brand has implemented 26.4% of rates since 2022, including 9.5% through the first 3 quarters of 2023. National General implemented rate increases of 10% in 2022 and an additional 8.8% through the first 9 months in 2023. We will continue to pursue rate increases to restore auto insurance margins back to target levels. Second, reducing operating expenses is core to both the profit improvement plan. And importantly, the transformative growth plan to become a low-cost provider of protection. Expenses are down and we have a path to further reductions. Third, we've restricted new business growth in areas and classes of business where we are not achieving target returns. Given the success we've had in some areas, we're selectively removing these restrictions in some states and segments; fourth, enhancing claim practices in a high inflationary and increasingly litigious environment are required to deliver customer value. That includes accelerating the settlement of injury claims and increasing in-person inspections. Turning to Slide 5. Let's touch base on why we believe this profit improvement will work in the current competitive environment. Allstate's capabilities and business model have generated industry-leading auto insurance margins over the last 10 years with an average combined ratio of roughly 96.5% and an average underwriting income of $800 million. That represents approximately a 5-point outperformance in the industry which generates an incremental profit of about $1.3 billion annually. Only a few of the other top 10 insurance companies have a similar record. In the current competitive environment, these same capabilities will enable us to continue the progress made in improving auto insurance margins. The rapid rise in auto claim severities eroded profits for the industry with most carriers responding by increasing auto insurance prices and lowering expenses. Allstate Progressive and GEICO has significantly raised auto insurance prices since 2019. State Farms increased its prices to a lesser degree but as a result, appears to be incurring large underwriting losses. Expense reductions are also being pursued by many companies, including lowering advertising spending which has moderated competition for new customers. The impact on policies in force is dependent on each company's individual profit and growth plan. As Mario will discuss, the Allstate brand policies in force has declined, particularly in 4 large states. GEICO's policies in force have declined by a larger amount, while Progressive has grown. Allstate's capabilities will enable achievement of the profit improvement plan in its competitive environment. Now let's review the potential sale of the Health and Benefits business on Slide 6. We acquired National General was primarily to improve our position in independent agent channel for Property-Liability insurance and we've exceeded our goals in that integration. The acquisition also gave us the opportunity to combine Allstate's voluntary benefits business with National General's group and individual health businesses. Successfully combining these into 1 business unit has created a strong benefits platform with substantial additional value can be realized by aligning with a broader set of product offerings, distribution and capabilities such as medical network management. Allstate Health and Benefits separates 3 successful businesses which is shown in the middle there and the $1 trillion employer benefit markets group and individual health when you add those all up. We've been the preeminent voluntary benefits provided for 24 years. With a comprehensive product offering that generates annualized premiums and contract charges of $1 billion and $300 million of new sales. National General's group health business targets the small case size market. And has $700 million of premium in fee revenue. And $400 million in new sales. The individual health protection is provided through both proprietary and third-party products which generates both underwriting and fee income. The Health and Benefits businesses have revenues of $2.3 billion which is 4% of total corporate revenues and adjusted net income of $240 million for the trailing 12 months which you can see in the 2 pie charts in the bottom and it's kind of spread between all the businesses. The employer voluntary benefits and group health businesses when you add them up, have roughly 48,000 relationships ranging from Fortune 50 companies to small businesses and over $4.3 million policies in force. The growth potential of these businesses can be accelerated with greater alignment with a wide range of companies in the market that are shown on the right-hand side. With its attractive business profile and financial results, we expect the transaction to be completed in 2024. In addition to improving profitability and strategically allocating capital, we continue to implement the transformative growth initiative to position the Property-Liability market share gains as margins improve. The fine components initiative was shown as top of Slide 7. Affordable simple connected protection is at the heart of the strategy to further improve customer value. Customers will have access to high-quality protection that better meets your needs at a low cost with hassle-free experiences. However, they choose to access our broad distribution network. We're live in the market with a new business experience and further enhance the connectivity of the Allstate at this week. Mario will discuss our success in expanding customer access. While each transformative growth element is at various stages of maturity. We're moving from Phase III of building new model towards scaling it in Phase IV. Now, I'll turn it over to Mario to go through the Property-Liability results. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Tom. Let's start on Slide 8. Our comprehensive auto profit improvement plan is improving margins. Property-Liability earned premium increased 10% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher average premiums which were partially offset by a decline in policies in force. The underwriting loss of $414 million in the quarter improved $878 million compared to the prior year quarter due to the improvement in our auto loss ratio. The chart on the right highlights the components of the 103.4 [ph] combined ratio in the quarter which improved 8.2 points despite a 2.8 point increase in the catastrophe loss ratio compared to prior year. Prior year reserve estimates, excluding catastrophes, were $166 million unfavorable or at 1.4 point [ph] adverse impact on the combined ratio in the quarter. $82 million was attributable to the runoff property liability annual reserve review. And $84 million in Allstate Protection primarily driven by national general personal auto injury coverages. The underlying combined ratio of 91.9 improved by 4.5 points compared to the prior year quarter and 1 point sequentially versus the second quarter of 2023 despite continued elevated severity inflation. Now let's move to Slide 9 to review Allstate's auto insurance profit trends. The third quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 102.1 was 15.3 points [ph] favorable to the prior year quarter, reflecting higher earned premium, lower adverse prior year reserve reestimates and expense efficiencies. As a reminder, we continuously assess claim severities as the year progresses. For example, last year, as 2022 developed, we increased current report year ultimate severity expectations which influenced the quarterly reported trends. While loss cost trends remain historically elevated, the pace of increase moderated in the third quarter. As Allstate brand weighted average major coverage severity improved to 9% compared to the 11% estimate as of the end of last quarter. The chart on the left shows the sequential improvement in quarterly underlying combined ratios from 2022 through the current quarter with quarterly reported figures adjusted to the full year severity level for 2022 and 2023 adjusted for current severity estimates as of the third quarter. Higher average premium and the continued execution of our profit improvement plan drove the sequential improvement in underlying combined ratio to 98.8 as reported or a 100.5 in the bar graph when removing the 1.7 point [ph] favorable impact on the third quarter from improved severity for claims reported in the first 2 quarters of the year. The chart on the right portrays how our comprehensive actions are resulting in a higher proportion of the portfolio progressing towards or achieving target levels of profitability. Excluding the 3 large states which generated 45% of Allstate brand auto underwriting loss in 2022, Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio was 97.2. The Premiums from states with an underlying combined ratio below 100 improved to 59% of the portfolio in the third quarter, doubling from the percentage at year-end 2022 and up almost 10 points from 50% in the second quarter. Slide 10 shows the impact on policies in force from actions to improve profitability. Allstate brand rate increases have exceeded 26% over the last 7 quarters. New issued applications shown in the middle chart, declined 19.5% compared to the prior year quarter, largely driven by actions to reduce growth in unprofitable states. California, New York and New Jersey combined declined 75% compared to the prior year. Allstate brand auto policies in force decreased by 6% in the third quarter compared to the prior year, partially driven by the lower new business and also driven by lower retention due to rate increases. Elevated loss trends in Texas required implementation of rate increases of over 50% in the last 21 months. As a result, retention has declined, while profitability has improved. Policies in force in these 4 large states combined decreased by 8.7%, whereas the remaining states declined by 4.7% compared to the prior year through the third quarter. On Slide 11, we take a deeper look at the National General Auto book. While third quarter margins were impacted by $95 million of unfavorable non-catastrophe prior year reserve reestimates primarily across liability coverages. The underlying combined ratio of 96.8 in the quarter and 95.7 year-to-date remains largely consistent with the prior year periods. Reflecting higher loss cost expectations given the reserve strengthening to date, offset by higher average premiums and expense efficiencies. The National General business as product, including fee-based revenue features and claims capabilities to accept in the nonstandard auto insurance market. As you can see in the chart on the right, 75% of the written premium growth in the third quarter of 2023 is coming from nonstandard auto which is more profitable than the overall national general auto insurance business. Our new middle-market product, Custom 360, is now available in nearly 1/3 of the U.S. market and is also contributing to growth. While the legacy National General and Encompass businesses which will be run off as we implement custom 360, are having the lowest impact on growth. Slide 12 covers homeowners insurance results which incurred an underwriting loss in Q3, driven by higher catastrophe losses. On the left, you can see net written premium increased 12.1% from the prior year quarter. primarily driven by higher average gross written premium per policy in both the Allstate and National General brands and a 0.8% increase in policies in force. Allstate Brand average gross written premium per policy increased by 13.2% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by implemented rate increases throughout 2022 and an additional 9.5 points implemented through the first 9 months of 2023. As well as inflation and insurance home replacement costs. The underlying combined ratio of 72.9 improved by 1.2 points compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher earned premium, lower frequency and a lower expense ratio, partially offset by higher severity. We remain confident in our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns in the homeowners business. Slide 13 highlights progress on expanding customer access as part of transformative growth. We continue to enhance capabilities across distribution channels and are the only major carrier with competitive offerings and branded agent, independent agent and direct distribution. The exclusive agent channel represents the majority of Allstate's U.S. personal lines premium at approximately $32 billion or roughly 22% market share in this channel. Our exclusive agents continue to be a strength, offering personalized local advice customers value in this $145 billion market. While exclusive agent auto new business decreased by 5% overall, applications per agency, excluding California, New York and New Jersey has increased by 13.4% so far this year. In addition, modifications to compensation have driven bundling at point of sale to an all-time high of over 75%. Agent performance continues to improve as they adapt to new compensation programs. We also have great growth potential through independent agents. The acquisition of National General strategically positioned Allstate to grow in the independent agent channel. National General continues to profitably grow nonstandard auto, while converting legacy Encompass and Allstate independent agent business onto their platform. Expanded nonstandard auto presence in 12 states represented 9% of National General's 12.9% increase in policies in force during 2023. As we leverage Allstate's expertise in standard auto and homeowners, this channel should represent another source of profitable growth. The direct channel had a significant decline in new business volume this year since this was the most effective place to reduce new business volume and was the most impacted by the reduction in advertising. We have improved our capabilities in this channel, so it will be another source of growth moving forward. And now, I'll hand it over to Jess to discuss the remainder of our results. Jesse Merten : All right. Thank you, Mario. I'll start on Slide 14 to discuss investment results. We proactively repositioned our investment portfolio based on continuous monitoring of changes in the economic environment, current market conditions and enterprise risk and return considerations. As shown in the chart on the left, net investment income totaled $689 million in the quarter, relatively flat to the third quarter of last year but with a higher contribution from the market-based portfolio. Market-based income of $567 million shown in blue, was $165 million above the prior year quarter, reflecting repositioning of the fixed income portfolio into longer duration bonds, a reduction of public equity holdings and higher interest rates. The chart on the right shows changes we made to the duration of the bond portfolio in comparison to interest rates. In 2021, we began reducing duration to reflect the belief that interest rates would rise. This not only reduced some losses as rates increased but it provided flexibility to reposition as yields increased. Starting in the middle of last year, we began increasing duration as rates increased which has increased market-based income. On Slide 15, let's take a closer look at our performance-based portfolio which offers diversification and enhances longer-term returns. The portfolio is anchored in private equity and real estate is diversified across infrastructure, energy, agriculture and timber investments. We hold more than 400 names, including funds with multiple underlying positions across diversified vintage years. These investments are focused on long-term value creation and we expect quarter-to-quarter income volatility as seen in the bars on the chart to the left, where quarterly returns have ranged from a negative 2.3% and to positive 8.6% over the last 5 years. The benefit from accepting this volatility is shown on the right with 3- and 5-year annualized returns of 19% and 12%. The private equity portion of the portfolio has outperformed public equity benchmarks over 3, 5 and 10 years. Slide 16 covers the results of our Protection Services businesses. Revenues in these businesses increased 8.9% to $697 million in the third quarter compared to prior year quarter. Increase is mainly driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans which increased 19.2% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting expanded products and international growth. In the table on the right, you will see that adjusted net income of $27 million in the third quarter decreased $8 million compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to the higher appliance and furniture claims severity and a higher mix of lower-margin business as we invest in growth at Allstate Protection Plans. These were partially offset by improved margins at Allstate Roadside and lower expenses at Allstate Identity Protection. Shifting to Slide 17. Our Health and Benefits business also had good results. Both revenues and income increased significantly with the National General acquisition in 2021 as we added scale and capabilities. For the third quarter of 2023, revenues of $587 million increased by $17 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by an increase in premiums, contract charges and other revenue in group health which was partially offset by a reduction in individual health and employer voluntary benefits. Adjusted net income of $69 million in the third quarter of 2023 increased $6 million compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to increases in group and individual health revenue and lower operating expenses. Now let's move to Slide 18 and discuss Allstate's approach to capital management to clarify how this differs from traditional methods used to evaluate capital such as the ratio of premiums to statutory surplus. On the left hand of the slide, we summarized 3 discrete components we evaluate to establish target capital which is the basis of our capital management framework. Base capital at the bottom is the capital required to meet ongoing operating requirements. Stress Capital is an additional layer of capital needed to cover tail events for the occurrence of multiple negative impacts, such as lower auto profitability and high catastrophe losses. The contingent reserve is for extremely low frequency and high severity events, a severe breakdown in diversification benefits and also provide strategic flexibility. We use a highly sophisticated model that breaks out individual risk types incorporates regulatory and rating agency considerations and uses extensive simulations to determine the right amount of capital for each component. This is more sophisticated and comprehensive than the ratio of premiums to surplus to determine the right amount of capital. For example, when calculating the premium to surplus ratio for the Allstate Insurance Company, the premiums for many of our subsidiary companies are included but over $1.6 billion of statutory capital is not included in the denominator. This framework also better assesses the use of catastrophe reinsurance particularly for large tail events then a simple ratio. Our sophisticated model and proactive actions provide flexibility to manage capital to maximize shareholder value creation. To close, let's turn to Slide 19 and recap all state strategic priorities. We continue making progress on our plan to return auto insurance profitability to targeted levels. We will pursue the divestiture of our Health and Benefits business, we're continuing to advance on our transformative growth initiatives. Proactive investment management has increased income. Allstate Protection Plans is expanding and these strategic priorities support value creation for Allstate shareholders. With that context, let's open the line to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Gregory Peters : I guess for the first question and there was a lot to unpack in your release and slide deck. I'm going to focus on Slide 7 which is the transformative growth strategy. I was looking at your slide and it talks about building the new model and scaling the new model. And I'm just curious if you're running elevated expenses at this point because you're running 2 separate models. And as you roll out the model, I'm curious about how it's accounting for the nuances of different customers. And I'm thinking about the needs of preferred customers versus standard versus nonstandard? Tom Wilson : Greg, good question. Let me -- so first, the transformative growth is about increasing market share in personal profit liability. It's got a couple of components at the core of that is being low-cost insurance but also about raising customer value and also about being available to people however they want to get to a specter segment and the customers. So I would say at this point, we've proven out that the underlying assumptions that we had made going into it work. So we know that lower price raises close right. We know that's true. We know that being available through more people, whether that's through different bundling with exclusive agents through independent agents or direct also works and we can do that. We know we can raise customer value, as you saw on the slide there, I didn't dig go into it but the new sales process is really slick. I mean it pops up with offers that are specifically for you, you don't have to pick your deductible, you don't have to go through a bunch of questions. People don't pick the deductible for you. It's fast, it's slick, then the renters piece which is in the middle one, takes less than a minute and we're finding great ways to attach more protection by making it simpler for customers. We're also making it more connected which is in the right-hand side. And so we relaunched the. We think that people are going to have fewer apps on their phone going forward. So having an app where people could just access either look at their bill or get their ID card is helpful but it's not compelling. So we are expanding that. So you'll see on their gas body. You can get figure out how to save money on buying gas which is, of course, directly related to what we do. We have a whole bunch of other things that we've either added or going to add. For example, we are really terrific on crash detection with our telematics experience through Arty and do that through Light 360 and it's a terrific product. So there's a variety of things we're doing to expand that. As it relates to expenses, we're continuing to invest in this. I don't know that I would say it's over expense it's just we have an objective. We have to lower our overall expenses. We're after that but we're not backing off on investing in the new technology. One of the things that we've proved out the underlying assumptions was can we build the technology to do what you see on that screen. And the answer is yes. We've built it, it's out -- it's working, it's rolling. We need to scale it but we have high confidence that it's scalable. So -- you should expect us to continue to find ways to reduce cost to live into this. But I don't think like there's like -- we're running hot in expenses today because of that. As it relates to the various segments of customers, we want to sell as many people as we can as much stuff as we can. However they want to come. If you want an agent, we'll give you an agent. We just have to make sure it's cost is what you're prepared to pay and they do what you want. -- whether that's an exclusive agent or an independent agent. And if you want to buy direct for the company, you want to buy to call so you want to buy on the web. We just want to make it as simple and easy as you can which we think is differentiated in the marketplace. Gregory Peters : Well, that makes sense. I guess for my follow-up, I'm going to pivot to the pricing slides. I'm thinking Slides 9 and 10. And was wondering if you could -- I know you provided detail in your comments but if you could give us an update on the problematic states. I think in Slide 9, you said 41% of the -- of your business in auto is running above 100. If we look forward to 2024, how do you think this chart might look? Tom Wilson : Which chart are you referring to, Greg? Gregory Peters : [Indiscernible]. Tom Wilson : Yes. I mean, of course, it all depends. Mario can give you some color as well. But it all depends what happens in California, New York and New Jersey. But let me be very clear, we are not going to continue to lose -- 4 digits in millions in those 3 states. So far, Mario has talked about us getting smaller by not growing we've executed that. The next step is to not be able to serve customers who we want to serve because we can't afford to those $0.20 on the dollar. Mario, do you want to comment on? Like we've been talking -- it's not like this as we just figured this out or they're not aware of. Mario Rizzo : Just to give you a little additional color across the 3 states. And Tom is right, we've been talking about this all year and we've taken pretty significant actions to restrict new business volumes and it's down like we talked about earlier, about 75%. We've got 3 significant rates pending rate pending across all 3 states. We have an auto rate in California that we filed back in May, I believe, 35% we've got a 29% filing pending in New Jersey. We implemented rates in New York ranging from high single digits to low double digits or low teens across our opening closed books middle of the year. We just filed for another 18.3% in New York auto. So we've got significant rates pending with the department. As Tom mentioned, where we're at now is we need action those filings in the fourth quarter. And if we can't, then we believe the right thing to do for the customers in the other 47 states as well as for our shareholders is to take additional action to get smaller across all 3 of those states and that's what we would do beginning next year if we can't get resolution on the rate filings that are currently pending. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : It's Marley [ph] on for Alex. So you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you were increasing in-person inspections to reduce overall claim costs. Could you touch on this a little bit more? How impactful is this? And then maybe how many of the current accidents are assessed now in person versus remote? And then how should we think about this for near-term changes to loss LAE? Mario Rizzo : Marley, this is Mario. I'll answer your question. So I would -- where I would start is going back to the different components of our auto profit improvement plan, taking rate increases, reducing costs, restricting new business in states where we aren't achieving target levels of profitability and improving operational processes and claims what you're describing around more in-person inspections is a component of that fourth piece of improving operational processes. We believe that by doing more physical inspections doing more oversight broadly of both in-network and out-of-network shops as well as doing the same thing on the property side as well that we'll be able to identify opportunities pay what we owe but also not pay for, say, things like pre-existing damage or in total loss cases, cars that could be repaired versus replace. So we think doing more in-person physical inspections in addition to continuing to leverage quick photo claim capabilities is the right thing to do to best manage loss cost going forward and that's what we intend to do to ensure that we're operationally excellent in claims and again, paying what we owe but eliminating any leakage in the system and we're prepared to invest in the claims organization to be able to execute on that. So in terms of the expense ratio, the LAE ratio as part of our adjusted expense ratio. We're still committed to hitting the 23 by the end of next year. The investments we'll make in claims are inclusive of that goal. We think we can do both. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then I just wanted to get your thoughts on longer-term severity drivers that you're seeing in terms of medical inflation and any impacts from the UAW strike? Mario Rizzo : Sure. So we'll start with medical inflation. And you'll note that we talked about our severity expectations in auto being about 9% currently which has improved from the 11% we talked about last quarter. All that improvement came from physical damage coverages. Our outlook on casualty and injury severity is unchanged. It didn't get worse but it's consistent with where we were last quarter. And the drivers behind that continue to be medical inflation more attorney representation, higher levels of treatment being pursued kind of all the components of both kind of economic and social inflation that have driven injury severities up. Overtime, those will continue to be headwinds for us. But as we -- again, as I talked about on the physical damage side, as we've adapted our claims processes to take into account those inflationary trends, we've seen some good progress. So we're looking to settle claims earlier in the cycle and we've seen a real improvement in terms of reduction in pending injury claims as well as faster settlement times on injury claims. We're using things like analytics and testing AI models to identify accidents where injuries are likely and those that have a higher likelihood of potentially being represented by attorney so that we can further accelerate claimant contact time and get out ahead of the process and manage the overall claim process. So we're doing things proactively to help mitigate some of those inflationary impacts. And we'll continue to do that. And like I said, we did see some stability in injury severity trends during the quarter. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question, during the quarter, you guys spoke about looking to buy some additional aggregate stop-loss reinsurance. Do you have any update on what you're doing on the reinsurance side in terms of looking to protect your capital position? Jesse Merten : Yes, Elyse. Thanks. This is Jess. We have talked a lot about our reinsurance program in general. As you know, we have a robust reinsurance program that reduces our overall capital levels. We've talked more recently about the aggregate cover. At this point, we don't have specific updates about the potential transaction. As I've talked about a number of times, we're looking at whether or not we can economically reduce overall risk and target capital. And to the extent we find a structure where we can get that done, we'll do it. And to the extent we can't get it done economically we'll move on and look at other options. So I would say, as it relates to this quarter, no updates. We continue to be interested in understanding what might be available to attract some new capital. sources into the industry and make them available. But we don't have anything firm to talk about at this point on that. Elyse Greenspan : And then my second question, you guys highlighted that you're looking into a potential transaction with the benefits business. Were there any diversification credits that you guys got from a capital perspective by owning the benefits business? Tom Wilson : Of course, yes. So they're there but we factor that into our overall position here. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski from BMO. Unidentified Analyst : This is Jack [ph] on for Mike. Just one question on changes to Allstate's captive distribution commission and fee structure. I think you mentioned earlier, how it has driven greater bundling rates. I'm just wondering does also expect this change to impact overall organic growth levels? And do you expect a meaningful benefit to the company's expense ratio? Tom Wilson : Well, I think when you go all the way up to transformative growth. Yes, we think that the whole package of stuff will drive market share growth. That includes making sure that the agents do what customers want them to do and that they're supported in doing that with technology and everything else in marketing and that they're well compensated for what they do. But yes, so there's various pieces on Mario, do you want to talk specifically about the account changes? Mario Rizzo : Yes. So again, I would characterize the most recent set of changes as a continuation of what we started really several years ago which was intended to drive higher levels of productivity in the exclusive agent distribution system but also reduced distribution costs over time. And I think what we're seeing if you -- particularly if you take out the impacts of the 3 large states where we're purposely driving reduced volume is exactly what we had hoped would happen. So from an expense standpoint, you see in the quarter, we benefited by 2 or 3 from [ph] the distribution cost perspective. So we're continuing to see the impacts and benefits of lower distribution costs. but more importantly, the productivity of the exclusive agency system continues to improve. So I can take out those 3 states, overall production was up 7.6%. Average productivity was up over 13%. And when you look at our top tier of agents, we segment agents into 3 categories, emerging Pro and Elite, that elite group, their level of production was up 15%. So that shows that agents continue to invest in their businesses and take advantage of increased shopping levels in the marketplace but they're focused on driving the kind of growth that will certainly become a real asset for us as we begin to lean back into growth as different states hit target levels of profitability. So we're really encouraged, both in terms of the performance of our agency channel, how they've adapted and the fact that we've been able to take cost out of the distribution system at the same time. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Joshua Shanker from Bank of America. Joshua Shanker : I have a model that goes pretty far back. And historically, if you look at reserves and try and analyze that -- it's hard in short-tail lines. Historically, Allstate run at about a 95% paid to incurred loss ratio. For every dollar of loss you put 5 in the reserves for future losses. And that's true in 3Q '23. But for the previous 5 quarters, it ran at an astonishingly low 83%. I know that you try and get the reserves right. But it does feel over this period of elevated loss ratio that the company put a lot more of its reserves of losses into reserve than any time in my model. Is there something different that had gone on over the past 5 quarters now that you're resuming a normal sort of pay to incur trend? Or is it just -- that was unusual period in you needed to put more reserve? Tom Wilson : Maybe I'll start and then Jess can fill in here. First, Josh but we think the reserves are right and we put up what we think we need to put up when we need to put it up as painful as that was last year. We felt we needed to put it up. When you look at the -- I don't know -- I'm not looking at specific numbers you have but I've been through reserves enough to the paid bounce around a lot. It depends what happened in the pandemic with impending levels and we adjust for all that. So, I would say just may have Jess may have some answer for it. I think Jess and Brent could walk through your model with you and help you see it. But I don't -- like we just think the reserves are right and we put them up when we believe Jess, anything to? Jesse Merten : No, I would agree with that. I also think you should keep in mind that, that same period was a period of extreme acceleration in the loss cost trend which you wouldn't see over the historical periods, right? So you're going to get a different pay-to-incurred ratio when you have acceleration, the way that we've seen and you saw what our severity trend was last year, you've seen what it is this year. So I think a component of that clearly is just the time period that you're looking at and the acceleration of the underlying trend. Joshua Shanker : And if you'll indulge me another question, Allstate over the next 20 years has really changed its geographic footprint away from catastrophe. And obviously, with climate change, people have seen a lot of losses and maybe the severity trend over the long term for cat-exposed properties up. But how does the -- severity trend compare between the trend in generally non-cat-exposed property versus cat exposed property, are states like Illinois and a lot of the Midwest seeing a very different trend than severity trends longer term from weather along the coast? Tom Wilson : Let me start and then Mario just if you guys want to jump in. First, I would start with saying we've built a really great business model in homeowners just like we make more money than the industry on auto insurance were even better in homeowners. And you see those results over 10 years. You do see this year a lot of catastrophes which is like to have an underwriting loss which we prefer not to have that said, catastrophes happen and that's why people buy insurance. So we're comfortable that, that worked. When you look underneath that and say, okay, what's driving those cat losses storms are more severe now. So just the fact you have a more severe storm will increase the severity of the losses that you have one on a strong, whether that's hail storm or a tornado or a hurricane, it just causes more damage. Underneath both that and a traditional loss are just the normal inflationary pressures. And so the cost of lumber goes up, whether you burn your house down or get knocked down by a hurricane, it's that underlying it. So you have kind of a compounding impact on catastrophes. That said, we're good at it. We manage it by state. So you're correct, Illinois would have less pressure because it would have less catastrophe losses than perhaps a state along the East Coast or in the Southwest on the coast. So -- we factored that all in and both of those things there. We do think though that we -- you've seen the raise in prices that spend both of those factors have increased it. So the dramatic increase in homeowners insurance prices has been driven by both those factors. Anything to add, Mario [ph]? Mario Rizzo : Yes. The only thing I'd add, Josh, I think you take a step back and say, what are the underlying drivers of the increase in homeowner severity -- and it's principally, as Tom mentioned, it's labor costs and its material cost to repair homes. And to the extent the rates of inflation vary across different parts of the country. Obviously, that will have an influence on state-specific severity. I think it's more driven by that. Than any -- whether it's cat exposed or not cat exposed because those costs just get amplified when there's a large event and we just have to repair a larger volume of homes. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Tracy Benguigui : Is the impetus selling the Health and Benefits business really to unlock capital and to restore some of your contingency capital? Or was the impetus to become a more lean organization and focus more on core offerings? Tom Wilson : Neither. And nor was it in relationship to any shareholder asking us to pursue a sale. I know a few of you wrote about. Let me just tell you what it is. So -- we're selling the businesses because it's the best way to capture the value credit. They're terrific businesses. I mean we make almost $0.25 billion a year. And we get a good platform, they have low capital requirements. We like the businesses. When we look forward to the future, though, we said we think we can harvest more growth from it if we had more complementary distribution, a broader set of products, capabilities such as network management of a health network like manage that. Those are things that we don't have today. We said we can build those it would take us time and money. On the other hand, we could access those that already exist. But that requires us to let go the success we've created. So we decided to choose the latter path. It had nothing to do with a shareholder coming to us and saying, you should sell this had nothing to do with needing the money, it has everything to do with this is the right way to manage your company to optimize shareholder value which is sometimes you have to let go of the success you've created. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. But maybe as a byproduct, assuming you could hit whatever valuation target range you have in mind might be early but would you have any kind of implied capital relief from your internal model from the sale? Tom Wilson : These are low capital businesses. So this First, I would say, on the price high would be the appropriate message I'd like you to carry out there because we do like the businesses a lot. Secondly, they're pretty low capital businesses. So whatever the sale price is, will generate additional capital. And then we'll decide what we want to do when we get there. We've got plenty of other growth opportunities. We're doing a lot with to grow market share and profit liability. We don't need to make that decision right now, so we're not going to. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Or could it potentially move down to AIC or accelerate your path to resume buybacks down the road? Tom Wilson : There's -- we have all the options that you would have to use capital. Organic growth to buying shares back. All those options are out there. We have no set plans for the capital. Right now, we're focused on -- this is a great business. We can help it be an even greater business by letting go of it. So that's what we're going to do. Jesse Merten : And I would add, Tracy, we -- our capitalization philosophy, as you know, we tend to keep the capital at the holding company to the extent that we can. So I don't believe we have a capital need at AIC that would cause us to want to do that. So I think we would remain with the philosophy of keeping the capital where it's at the holding company level to the extent we have capital management decisions to make, as Tom said, we'll make him when the time comes. But I don't think we have a need for capital in AIC. So I don't know why we would go away from the philosophy of keeping it up and holding company. Tracy Benguigui : Got it. And just quickly on your commentary of extending your asset duration now at 4.6 years. I mean you don't have a life business anymore. You plan to divest the Health and Benefits business. How you think about the optimal asset duration relative to your pro forma duration of your remaining liabilities? Tom Wilson : Well, we look at it from an enterprise risk and return standpoint. So the first thing we do is say, how much capital do we want to allocate to the investment portfolio. And then John and his team figure out how they best want to allocate that amongst various asset classes. So John may want to make a comment on where we are at today. I would point out that if you look at Slide 14, we made the right calls at the right time. Mario Rizzo : Yes. I'd just add that -- another thing to consider when one lengthens out duration is just that you keep the appropriate amount of liquidity and flexibility in the portfolio. And I can assure you that we are doing that between the cash that we hold short-term position to other things that we can turn into cash in short order and just maturities by year-end, we're close to $10 billion. So we believe that we're both capturing the additional income that the market is giving us. lengthening out to preserve the capture of that income for a longer period of time, building some resilience into the portfolio in case the economic environment would change, while also providing adequate liquidity. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. So it sounds like you feel comfortable with durational mismatch because of your strong liquidity position. Is that fair? Tom Wilson : Well, the Property-Liability business is a little different than the life business in terms of matching to liabilities. In the life business scores, we have a set maturity date and you can factor in some stuff and you figure out let's match that off. In the Property-Liability business, of course, the liabilities are much shorter but then they're naturally recurring. So you pay off 1 claim and you get another one. Is that a separate claim or -- and so if you match it to that, you'd be having here for 90 days for a physical damage claims. So it's really more about liquidity and overall risk management. And I would also point out a large part of our set capital is there in case we mess up on underwriting income. And so that has a really long duration on it. Mario Rizzo : Yes. Tracy, 1 other thing to add, if you look at the slide, the blue line depicts the duration, we've really just reverted back to what's been more of a long-term average for us. So we were at a point in time where we were in a lower level of duration, a lower level of interest rate exposure. We thought that was right given what was happening with the Fed and interest rates in general. Now that rates have climbed back up pretty aggressively. We want to go back to what has been a longer run central tendency for us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : I just had a question on the frequency trends that you guys saw in the third quarter. Could you just describe what you guys are seeing. It sounded like that was up a little bit. I was hoping you could put some numbers around it and sort of what you're seeing, especially as it looks like you're shrinking units. I would think that there would be some benefit from improving the mix of business. But I was hoping you could maybe just touch on that. Mario Rizzo : David, it's Mario. Thanks for the question. I'll talk a little more qualitatively about frequency since we now are disclosing more pure premium trends which combine the overall loss trend. We just think it's a better way for you all to look at and think about auto profitability. But in terms of auto frequency, the headline is it continues to revert back to pre-pandemic levels but remains below where it was in 2019. There continues to be a tailwind when you think about the safety features embedded in vehicles that will continue to help improve frequency, we think, from a long-term trend going forward. And then when you look at the other driver which is driving activity. When we look at our telematics data, we look at the number of miles that a person is driving each day. It's up mid-single digits compared to last year, still skewing less to rush hour times which benefit frequency and more to nonpeak hours. But that trend has been pretty stable over the last several quarters and we feel like we're in a period of stability in terms of driving behavior. So net-net frequency is up modestly. It's a small component of pure premium. So just to give you a couple of numbers. When you adjust out the intra-year impact in pure premium, it's up about 9.7% year-over-year in the quarter and we said severity was up 9% [ph]. So you can see the modest impact that frequency is having, again, as people drive a bit more than they were a year ago. David Motemaden : Got it. And you're saying it's a little bit more stable now, so maybe flattens out there at those levels? Mario Rizzo : Yes, David, the trend has been pretty stable over the last several quarters in terms of when we look at miles driven for our book. David Motemaden : Got it. And then for my follow-up, just to add a question on Slide 13 and I appreciate this information on the distribution channels. I was hoping -- it looks like you guys track the TAM by channel pretty closely. Within the exclusive agent channel, how has that TAM been growing -- and I guess, I'm under the impression that it's been shrinking at the expense of the direct and independent agent channels. So just given that backdrop, I'm wondering if you're seeing signs that you think you can sort of buck that trend and start to grow within your exclusive agency channel? Tom Wilson : Let me David maybe a couple of thoughts. First, there's a lot of analysis on it. People want to tend to like assume that it's a straight line. And actually, there's competition for the customer amongst all of those. So our effort to reduce the cost that Mario talked about in providing an agent is to give customers better value which should take share away from some of the other 2. The independent agents also are a good place people want to come where they don't want to just buy from an insurance company. They want somebody to shop around for them and want them to do the work for it. On the direct channel, obviously, with increased connectivity, the direct channel has certainly grown. But it's also growing a lot because billions of dollars of advertising going to it. So it's an overall ecosystem, I guess, I would say. And so we look at it and like, we want to be there. People want to have buy from a company like Allstate. Allstate brand name, want to go to that agent. We want to be there for that person with everything they have. The same thing if they want someone to shop or on them, don't want to do the work. We want to be in that independent agent channel. And then in a direct channel, if they want to buy directly then. And what we are doing is using the technology between those various things make it an even better value proposition. So we showed you that cell phone which had the 3 offers in it. Imagine an agent now being able to not have to ask you a whole bunch of stuff; what's your deductible, what kind of stuff. But we pre-populate it with, here's what we think David's deductible should be, offer David this package you put them in a different position. So we look at it really as sort of organic and it moves between there. And we want to be there for all of our customers. So it's not like we think 1 is going to win and the other is going to lose. It's just a constant competition to just do a better job for the customers that want to buy it that way. Jonathan, we'll take one more question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our final question for today comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Unidentified Analyst : It's Jen [ph] on for me. Most of my questions are answered just 1 on the growth in 2024. So what is your expectation and plan for next year? Is the nonstandard auto still be the key growth driver -- any color on that would be great? Tom Wilson : Mario will give you some specifics. I would say that the biggest impact -- so first, we're starting to grow in the Allstate brand. Mario has got a number of states where he's starting to roll out, transform growth in a more aggressive way to capture the market share growth. So we comfortable there. The independent Asian business, we think, will grow through continued expansion of the nonstandard and the Custom 360 Mario talked about, I would say that the biggest driver. The biggest thing we're unclear on right now is what happens in New York, New Jersey and California. That will be the biggest impact on policies in force. May be different than the growth measure you're talking about but certainly, we need to get properly priced in those states. Or else will get smaller in those states. And given that they're a large percentage for our book of business, it will impact overall policy. Mario thing you would add to that? Mario Rizzo : Yes. The only thing I'd add as we look ahead is -- I think it's important to recognize that we manage the business on a local level. That means state by state, market by market, risk segment by risk segment; that's been the approach we've taken to improve profitability and we're taking that same approach as we look forward in terms of growth. And I think it's -- where we're at is really 2 groupings of states emerging. Tom talked about the 3 that we've just got to get more rate and get more profitable. And before we can even begin to think about growing and investing in growth because it just economically doesn't make sense for us and that's California, New York, New Jersey. The rest of the states that if you divide them, there's a number of states that are already at target levels of profitability and we're beginning to do things like make local marketing investments, leverage a lot of the capabilities we've been building with transformative growth, the momentum we've got in the exclusive agent channel, the improvements we've made in direct and the capabilities we've built there and what we're building in the independent agent channels with things like Custom 360 and nonstandard auto. So we feel like as a system we are much more effectively positioned to grow when the time is right for us to grow. And as we look out into 2024, we think more states will fall into that ready-to-grow category in terms of target levels of profitability. And we look forward to continuing to invest in growth in those states and leverage the capabilities we've been building with transformative growth. Tom Wilson : So let me close with 4 points which summarize kind of the conversation we had. What's going to drive shareholder back profitability increases, strategic capital allocation great investment returns and then transform growth long-term sustainable growth. We think those 4 things combined make this a great opportunity. Thank you very much. We'll see you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

After prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, please be aware this call is being recorded. And now, I\u2019d like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Brent Vandermause, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Brent Vandermause : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. And welcome to Allstate\u2019s fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday, following the close of market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted related material on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and our strategy. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement, and forward-looking statements about Allstate\u2019s operations. Allstate\u2019s results may differ materially from these statements. So please refer to our 10-K for 2022 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now, I will turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Good morning. And we appreciate you taking the time and spending your efforts to explore why Allstate is an attractive investment. So I will begin with an overview of our strategy and results, and Mario and Jess, can go through the operating performance. Then we will have time for your questions at the end. Let\u2019s begin on slide two, which depicts Allstate\u2019s strategy to increase shareholder value. So we have two components to this strategy, increase personal Property-Liability market share and expand protection provided to customers, which are shown in the two ovals on the left. On the right-hand side, you can see the highlights for the fourth quarter. We generated net income of $1.5 billion. The strong results reflect our actions to improve auto insurance profitability and mild weather conditions, which was a welcome reprieve from the elevated level of weather related losses in the first three quarters of the year. The proactive approach to increasing bond duration also contributed to strong results with higher income from the market based portfolio. To further increase shareholder value this year, we remain focused on improving auto insurance profitability. There is more work to be done, but we are well on our way. Additional shareholder value will then be increased by increasing policies in-force across all of our businesses. The transformative growth initiatives to drive Property-Liability market share growth can be implemented in more states this year now as auto margins have been improved. We are also focusing on expanding protection offerings to Protection Services businesses, which is shown in the lower oval as Protection Plans, Identity Protection, Roadside and Arity, all have good growth prospects. As you know, we started the process to sell the Health and Benefits business and that process is proceeding on schedule. Let\u2019s review the financial results on slide three. Revenues of $14.8 billion in the fourth quarter increased by 8.7%. That reflects a 10.7% increase in Property-Liability earned premium and that was due to rate increases in 2022 and -- mostly in 2022, and in 2023 in both the auto and homeowners\u2019 insurances. Net investment income in the quarter was $604 million, an 8.4% increase, reflecting higher fixed-income yields and duration extension, which is partially offset by lower performance based income. The strong profitability in the quarter generated adjusted net income of $1.5 billion or $5.82 per diluted share. Annual revenues of $57 billion were up $5.7 billion or 11.1% over the prior year. Strong fourth quarter earnings resulted in positive adjusted net income for the year. Slide four summarizes the status of the four-part auto insurance profit improvement plan. Strong execution resulted in 6.7% point improvement in the combined ratio in 2023. Starting with rates. Since 2022, the Allstate brand implemented rate increases 33.3%, which included 16.4% in 2023 and 6.9% in the fourth quarter, driven by the recent approvals in California, New York and New Jersey. National General implemented rate increases of 10% in 2022 and an additional 12.8% in 2023. Looking forward, we will pursue rate increases in 10 states to improve margins and in other states to keep pace with increases in loss costs. Expense reductions were initiated in 2019 as part of the transformative growth plan to become a low cost provider of protections, being early in this effort helped offset the rapid inflation in loss costs. The underwriting expense ratio decreased 1.1 points in 2023 compared to the prior year when you exclude the large decline in advertising that was directly linked to lower profitability. Looking forward, further cost reductions will improve efficiencies and our competitive price position. Given the significant improvement in perspective, auto margins will increase advertising investment this year. In addition, we implemented underwriting actions to restrict new business, where we were not achieving target returns. We are moving some underwriting restrictions as rate adequacy is achieved. Finally, enhancing claim practices in a high inflation and increasingly litigious environment are required to deliver good customer value. This includes accelerating the settlement of injury claims and increasing in-person inspections. This program has positioned us to increase new business levels and begin to grow policies in-force in sales where acceptable margins have been restored. Now I will turn it over to Mario to discuss Property-Liability. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s start on slide five. Property-Liability earned premium increased 10.7% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by, excuse me, higher average premiums from rate increases, partially offset by a 2% decline in policies in-force. Underwriting income of $1.3 billion in the quarter improved $2.4 billion compared to the prior year quarter due to increased premiums earned, improved underlying loss experience, lower catastrophe losses and operating efficiencies. The chart on the right highlights the components of the 89.5 combined ratio in the quarter, which improved 19.6 points from the prior year quarter. The impact of catastrophe losses and prior year reserve re-estimates on the combined ratio as shown in light blue and gray materially improved compared to the prior year. Catastrophe losses of $68 million were $711 million or 6.3 points lower than prior year due to the mild weather conditions experienced in the quarter and favorable loss development from prior period events. Prior year reserve re-estimates, excluding catastrophes, were unfavorable and totaled $199 million, representing a 1.6-point adverse combined ratio impact in the quarter and a 0.9-point favorable impact compared to the prior year quarter. Approximately $148 million related to personal auto driven in part by costs related to claims in litigation and adverse development in National General. The underlying combined ratio of 86.9, improved by 12.3 points compared to the prior year quarter, due to higher average premium and the favorable influence of milder weather conditions on accident frequency. Despite the favorable results in the quarter, the full year combined ratio of 104.5 was significantly impacted by elevated catastrophe losses primarily from events in the first three quarters, resulting in a catastrophe loss ratio that was 4 points above the 10-year average from 2013 to 2022. Now let\u2019s move to slide six to review Allstate\u2019s auto insurance profit trends. The fourth quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 98.9 improved by 13.7 points compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting higher earned premium, lower underlying losses, lower adverse prior year reserve re-estimates and expense efficiencies. The chart shows the underlying combined ratios from 2022 and 2023 with quarterly reported figures adjusted to reflect the estimated average severity level as of year-end for each year. As you can see, the underlying combined ratio decreased each quarter in 2023, reflecting the benefits of the profit improvement plan, Tom discussed earlier. As a reminder, we continually reassess claim severity expectations as the year progresses. If the current year expected severity increases or decreases, the year-to-date impact of that change is recorded in the current quarter, despite a portion of that impact being driven by reassessment of the prior quarters. In 2023, the full year estimate of claim severity decreased in the fourth quarter. So there was a benefit from prior quarters included in reported results in the fourth quarter. When you adjust for this, the reported underlying combined ratio of 96.4, as shown in the table would be 98.2 as shown in the bar on the graph. The three preceding quarters all benefit from the adjustments, including Q3, which improved from 100.5 in the presentation shown last quarter to 99.9, reflecting the latest severity estimates. While loss cost trends remain historically elevated, the rate of increase moderated in the second half of the year, mainly in physical damage coverages. Allstate brand weighted-average major coverage severity expectations improved from 11% as of the end of the second quarter to 9% in the third quarter and now that 8% to 9% at the end of the year. As a reminder, this trend reflects our current best estimate for the year-over-year increase in average severity. Slide seven shows the impact of our profit improvement actions across the country. As shown on the left, Allstate\u2019s brand rate increases have exceeded 33% over the last eight quarters, including larger increases in California, New York, New Jersey and Texas, reflective of the elevated loss trends in these states. These four states comprised 36% of Allstate brand auto total written premiums in the U.S. during 2023. As you know, increases were approved in California, New York and New Jersey in December. So we have yet to see this in earned premiums. The chart on the right shows states with an underlying combined ratio below 100, shown in the light and dark blue bars were 65% of the total in 2023, more than doubling from the percentage at year-end 2022. Excluding California, New York, and New Jersey, the Allstate brand auto insurance underlying combined ratio was 95.9 in 2023. Slide eight shows improving profitability had a negative impact on policies in-force during 2023. On the left, you can see that total Protection Auto policies in-force, decreased by 2.9% compared to prior year, as the Allstate brand decline of 6.2% more than offset a 13.3% increase at National General. Allstate brand auto policies in-force decreased due to reduced new business volumes and lower retention. National General growth of 581,000 policies in-force was mostly driven by non-standard auto insurance and to a lesser extent, the rollout of new middle-market standard and preferred auto insurance product launches for the Custom 360 products. The chart on the right shows total personal auto new issued applications for 2023 decreased 6% compared to the prior year and the accompanying drivers. Targeted profitability actions within the Allstate brand resulted in a decline in new auto issued applications of 20% compared to the prior year. The first two red bars reflect the impact of lower new business volume in California, New York and New Jersey, as well as the direct channel decline in the remainder of the country, which was most directly impacted by the reduction in marketing investment last year. Outside of the three states where profit actions significantly reduced new business, Allstate exclusive agents increased production by 6%, driven by higher productivity, showing the response of Allstate agents to the changes we have made to incent growth and the opportunity to continue to grow with our agency owners as part of transformative growth. The acquisition of National General strategically positioned Allstate to grow in the independent agent channel with new business applications, increasing 12% in 2023. National General continues to grow non-standard auto and generate higher volume from the Custom 360 product launches. Slide nine covers homeowners\u2019 insurance results, which generated significant profits for the quarter, while full year results were impacted by elevated catastrophe losses in the first three quarters of the year. On the left you can see net written premium increased 13.3% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher average gross written premium per policy in both the National General and Allstate Brands, and a 1.1% increase in policies in-force. National General net written premium grew 19.6% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to policy in-force growth, driven by the Custom 360 offering and higher average premiums from implemented rate increases. Allstate brand net written premiums increased 12.5%, driven by average gross written premium per policy increases of 12.2% compared to the prior year quarter and a small increase in policies in-force. Allstate agents continue to bundle auto and homeowners\u2019 insurance at historically high levels. Catastrophe losses of $21 million in the fourth quarter were low by historical standards, reflecting milder weather conditions and favorable development from prior events contributing to a 62 combined ratio and $1.2 billion of underwriting income for the quarter. Milder weather in the fourth quarter also favorably influenced the underlying combined ratio due to lower non-catastrophe claim frequency. For the full year, higher catastrophe losses drove the combined ratio increase in 2023 compared to 2022. Full year catastrophe losses of $4.5 billion were higher than our historical experience and translated to a catastrophe loss ratio that was 17 points higher than prior year and roughly 14 points above the 10-year average from 2013 to 2022. As you can see from the chart on the right, the full year underlying combined ratio declined from 70.3 in 2022 to 67.3 in 2023, reflecting higher average premiums from rate increases, partially offset by higher claims severity due to materials and labor costs. With an industry-leading product, advanced pricing, underwriting and analytics, broad distribution capabilities and a comprehensive reinsurance program, we will continue to leverage homeowners as a growth opportunity and remain confident in our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns in this line. Moving to slide 10, let\u2019s discuss how we are advancing transformative growth to provide customers low-cost protection through broad distribution. We remain focused on four key elements of this multiyear initiative, as you can see on this slide. We have improved our cost structure to enhance our competitive price position. In the current environment with most competitors taking large rate increases, it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint competitive position. That said, our relative competitive position likely deteriorated in 2023. But as many of our competitors continue to implement rate increases and our expenses decline, we believe our competitive position will improve enhancing growth opportunities as part of transformative growth. Redesigned, affordable, simple and connected products currently available for auto insurance in seven states with plans for further expansion this year, both improve customer value and deliver a differentiated customer experience. National General independent agent growth prospects will be further enhanced by expanding Custom 360 products, which were live in 16 states as of year-end 2023 and expect to be in nearly every state by the end of 2024. Expanding customer access will also support market share growth and we have made good progress in all three channels. Increasing sophistication and customer acquisition continues to advance and will improve the effectiveness of increased advertising spend in 2024, as we look to grow in more states. A new technology ecosystem is also being deployed to improve the customer experience, speed-to-market and reduce costs for legacy technology platforms. Let me turn it over to Jess now to talk about expense reductions and other operating results. Jesse Merten : All right. Thank you, Mario. On slide 11 we delve deeper into how we are improving customer value through expense reductions. As shown in the chart on the left, the Property-Liability underwriting expense ratio decreased two points from 2022 to 2023 as we continue to focus on lowering costs to provide more value to customers and some of the benefits of higher earned premium growth relative to fixed costs. The right half of the chart provides additional context on the drivers of the 1.3-point improvement in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year quarter. The first red bar shows the two-tenth of a point impact from increased advertising spend, reflecting the slight increase was driven by seasonal investment changes and growth investments in rate adequacy states. The second green bar shows the 1.4 -- 1.4-point decline in operating costs, which was mainly driven by lower employee-related costs and the impact of higher premiums relative to fixed costs in the quarter. Shifting to the longer term trend in the chart on the right, we remain committed to reducing the adjusted expense ratio as part of transformative growth. As a reminder, the adjusted expense ratio starts with our underwriting expense ratio, which I just covered and excludes restructuring COVID-related expenses, amortization and impairment of purchased intangibles and advertising expense. It then adds our claims expense ratio, excluding costs associated with settling catastrophe claims. Those expenses are excluded because catastrophe-related costs tend to fluctuate. Through innovation, process improvement and strong execution, we have driven significant improvement in expenses for the fourth quarter and year-end 2023 adjusted expense ratio of 24.7. This reflects decreases in both the underwriting expense and non-cat claims expense ratio compared to the prior year quarter. Now moving to slide 12, I will cover investment results. This quarter showed how our proactive approach to duration management benefits results. The chart on the left shows changes we made in the duration of the bond portfolio in comparison to bond market yields, from the fourth quarter of 2021 through the third quarter of 2022, lowering fixed-income duration, mitigated losses as rates rose. Beginning in Q4 of 2022, we began to extend duration which when combined with higher yields has increased market-based income. Our fixed income yield, shown in the table below the chart, remains below the current intermediate corporate bond yield, reflecting an additional opportunity to increase yields as we continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows into higher interest rates. The bar chart on the right shows the income and total return benefits of these decisions. As you can see in the table on the chart, the total return of our portfolio was 4.6% in the fourth quarter and 6.7% for the year. Portfolio returns in both periods reflect income earned, as well as higher fixed income valuations due to the decline in market yields in the fourth quarter. Net investment income totaled $604 million in the quarter, which was $47 million above the fourth quarter of last year. Market based income of $604 million shown in blue, was $140 million above the prior year quarter, reflecting the repositioning of the fixed income portfolio into longer duration and the benefit from higher yielding assets that sustainably increase income. Market based income also benefit -- benefited from higher fixed-income balances. Performance based income of $60 million shown in black, was 87 million below the prior year quarter due to lower valuation increases and fewer sales of underlying assets. As we have stated previously, the performance based portfolio is expected to enhance long-term returns as demonstrated through our five-year and 10-year internal rates of return of 12% and volatility in these assets from quarter-to-quarter is expected. Slide 13 covers results for our Protection Services businesses. Revenue in these businesses increased 11.8% to $719 million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year quarter. This result is mainly driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans, which increased 19.6% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting expanded product breadth and international growth. In the table on the right, you will see adjusted net income of $4 million in the fourth quarter decreased $34 million as compared to the prior year quarter. This decrease is attributable to the results of a state income tax examination that increased the effective state tax rate that we apply, which increased deferred income taxes by $43 million in the quarter for future tax payments and Protection Services, largely related to dealer services. The impact of the tax change on the enterprise was a net benefit of $6 million. We do not anticipate that these tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our ongoing operations. Shifting now to slide 14, our Health and Benefits businesses continue to generate profitable growth. From the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue of $630 million increased by $50 million compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by growth in individual health, group health, as well as fees and other revenue. Adjusted net income of $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, increased $2 million compared to the prior year quarter as individual health revenue growth partially offset higher benefit ratios in group health. As you know, late last year, we announced a decision to pursue the divestiture of our Health and Benefits business following the successful integration of Allstate\u2019s voluntary benefits business in National General\u2019s Group and individual health businesses. We continue to anticipate a transaction will be completed in 2024. We will close on slide 15 by reviewing Allstate\u2019s financial condition and capital position. Allstate\u2019s proactive capital management approach provides the financial flexibility, liquidity and capital resources necessary to navigate a challenging operating environment, while providing support for long-term value creation. Fourth quarter results demonstrated the company\u2019s capital generation capabilities with a statutory surplus in holding company assets of $18 billion, increasing by $1.6 billion compared to the prior quarter. Assets held at the holding company also increased to $3.4 billion. The increase to the prior quarter primarily reflects a return of capital from National General statutory entities, partially offset by common shareholder dividends. Additionally, GAAP shareholders\u2019 equity of $17.8 billion increased $3.2 billion compared to the prior quarter, reflecting $1.5 billion of GAAP net income and the improved unrealized position on fixed income securities of $1.9 billion. We continue to proactively manage capital, make progress on the comprehensive profit improvement plan and invest in transformative growth. We remain confident that these strategic actions will generate attractive shareholder returns. With that as context, let\u2019s open it up for your questions. Operator : Certainly. One moment for our first question. And our first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your question please. Jimmy Bhullar : Hey. Good morning. So I had a couple of questions. First, can you talk about rate adequacy in California, New York, New Jersey, the new business that you are issuing there now is that adequate price for normal profitability or are you assuming that you are going to need another sort of stab at it in 2024 to get the normal profits? Tom Wilson : Thank you, Jimmy. I will let, Mario, really three different stories, Mario will take you through those in, then we will do a follow-up question, and I would just remind everybody, we like -- ask one question with a follow-up, hopefully, related to the first question. But so we can make sure we get through everybody\u2019s call. So, Mario, you... Mario Rizzo : Yeah. So, Jimmy, first thing I\u2019d say is, we have talked a lot last quarter about the actions we needed to take in the three states, California, New York and New Jersey. I will start with a view that says, look our objective is to meet the protection needs of as many customers in as many states as possible. When that can happen, we think customers are served well, markets operate effectively and we can operate our business to achieve the appropriate levels of returns. We had rate pending in all three of those states and I will just spend a minute kind of giving you the story in each one of those, because I think it\u2019s slightly different. In California, you will remember we filed a 35% rate. We got approval for 30 %. But we got approval earlier than our expected effective date. So, effectively, we filed our full rate need and got approval for our full rate need. As of yesterday, we are writing business in California, again across all channels and we feel comfortable writing business in California given the rate level that we are operating. Now, of course, having said that, we have got to stay on top of loss trends going forward and we will do that, but we are comfortable with the rate level, we have gotten California that have opened up that market. In New Jersey, it\u2019s kind of the opposite story we filed for 29 points of rate, we got approval for just under 17%. And as a result of that, we are going to continue to take the more restrictive underwriting actions that we have been taking in New Jersey, which means we will continue to get smaller in New Jersey, while we plan on filing additional rate as a matter of fact, we have two rates pending with the New Jersey Department and depending on how those things shake out that that will inform future actions we take in New Jersey. But as of right now, we will continue to get smaller in New Jersey, just given the lack of rate adequacy. And New York is kind of somewhere in between, we got approval for a 14.6% rate in December. We have implemented that, that helps. But we still need more rate. We are actively engaged with the department and intend to file our full rate need going forward and do that in reasonably short order. And again, depending on how that plays out, that will inform the next set of actions we have taken in New York. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then just a follow-up, maybe slightly related and slightly unrelated, in those three states, if you are raising prices a lot, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that you would suffer in terms of discount or at least at a minimum, it wouldn\u2019t grow. But how is your PIF faring in the states where you are not taking any outsized rate actions versus what some of your peers are taking and just trying to assess whether you think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that your overall PIF count stabilizes at some point this year for the company as a whole and potentially grows this year, later in the year or next year. Tom Wilson : Jimmy, this is Tom. I will start and then Mario can give -- can add on to that. I would say that the current competitive environment is still in flux. So, we raise our rates 30 points in California. State Farm gets another increase somewhere after that. So it\u2019s too early to tell what impact that will have on volume in 2024. We do -- our goal, though, is obviously to, one, make good money for our shareholders as first part, and as Jess said, the other part is, we need to grow. So we are -- we think we have got transformative growth in place, which is differentiated in a long-term growth plan, as well as some of the short-term things you are talking about here. Mario, what would you add to that? Mario Rizzo : Yeah. I think, specifically, on retention, Jimmy, as Tom mentioned, in the three states we talked about, those markets are still in a bit of a state of flux. One state I\u2019d point to, to kind of tell the story about retention and how taking outsized rates and then kind of lapping that impacts retention is Texas. We took significant rates in Texas in 2022 and earlier in 2023 and we showed you last quarter there was a pretty substantial hit to retention in Texas. As we have lapped those rates, we have seen a nice bounce back which contributed to the sequential improvement in the fourth quarter retention level in auto relative to Q3. So, once the rate need stabilizes, that certainly has a positive impact on retention going forward. And hopefully, as we in more and more states are really just keeping on top of loss trend, we would expect the headwind that we faced in retention to diminish going forward. Jimmy Bhullar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Your question please. Gregory Peters : Okay. Good morning, everyone. I -- for my first question, I\u2019d like to focus on transformative growth and it\u2019s kind of counter intuitive, right, because you are talking about lowering expenses at the same time growing your policy count. So when I think of some of the headwinds going forward on expenses, I think, of increased agent commission because profitability is going up. I see maybe the potential for increased advertising expense. So maybe you can help us pull together on how you see growth emerging at a lower expense base? Tom Wilson : Greg, I will start and Mario can jump in. So I don\u2019t know that, I think, there is counterintuitive that as you grow your expenses can\u2019t go down, and I would point out, if you look at National General, its growth has helped drive more scale and has brought its expenses down. So that\u2019s just a scale-related comment to it. As you relate -- you look at the programs we have in place on transformative growth, it\u2019s really across the Board. Everywhere we are at where programs that are -- we have been working on for three plus years and they are rolling out as we go. For example, we are cutting costs by becoming more digital. By becoming more digital, we can move more jobs either get rid of the jobs or move them offshore. That\u2019s a multiyear thing. You don\u2019t just take first notice of loss and change it in three months. So the benefits of those programs, which we have been working and rolling those out for the last 18 months really still will get more of those benefits as we go forward in 2024 just based on the work we have already done. In terms of agent commission, Mario mentioned this, we have changed the agent commission structure such that it pays more for new business and less for renewals and that was one of the core parts of transformative growth was how do we distribute our products at a lower price and still give people the value of an agent. And people want an agent to buy the stuff, they don\u2019t necessarily want to pay as much for attention. One of the underlying assumptions we validated with transformer growth, which quite honestly, a number of analysts and other people were not so sure, but you are going to keep agents head in the game? And the answer is, yes. Look at the productivity numbers that Mario showed. Do they like having renewal compensation go down? No. Do our customers like having a better priced product? Yes. And so we choose to do what our customers want and they have worked through that. So we have a series of things that go on. Now, we do spend money, but like -- we are doing our expenses to, first, take care of our customers, second, build long-term value. We are not running our expenses to make a particular P&L number in a quarter. We just don\u2019t do that. We cut advertising, as you pointed out, because there was no sense growing if you are losing money on the product. It wasn\u2019t because we were trying to make some combined ratio target. It certainly helped that. But we are like, why go out and advertise if you are going to write it at 105 combined ratio. So we think about it economically first and in terms of creating long-term value. Mario, do you want to talk about how you are thinking about expenses and where you go this year? Mario Rizzo : Yeah. So, Greg, I think, when you combine the pieces that Tom talked about, I think, you can get comfortable that we can continue to improve our expense ratio and our cost structure to get more competitively priced and invest in marketing at the same time. So when I think about the broad areas where we are looking to get more efficient and where we have gotten more efficient over the last several years, first, distribution costs. So when you look at the progress we have made on creating a lower cost but more productive Allstate agency distribution system. We are really happy with the progress we have made there. And I have talked a little bit earlier about the increases in overall production. But underneath that, the even more significant increases in average productivity as we have fewer agents producing more volume today than was the case a couple of years ago. And within our expense ratio, the distribution cost component of our expense ratio has continued to come down while we have been able to do that. So I am really optimistic that as we move forward and look to grow in more states that our Allstate agency force is going to be a core part of that and we will continue to be able to do that, but do that at a lower distribution cost overall. On the operating cost side through the combination of becoming more digital, outsourcing, offshoring, just improving processes, we have seen pretty significant reduction in operating costs going forward and we are going to continue to hammer on that one. We have also seen similar improvements on the claim side. Although I will say we are going to continue to invest in claims as part of profit improvement plan to get more effective on a number of processes. And I think the combination of the efficiencies we will get in those three areas will help fund the marketing investments that we want to make and will make as we look to accelerate growth. Gregory Peters : Okay. Tom Wilson : But if we need to spend money to grow on advertising and we like the profitability, we are going to spend more money on advertising. Gregory Peters : That makes sense. Can you just help remind me how the transformative growth plan moves over and touches National General or is National General sort of in its own ecosystem in terms of how you are thinking about expenses? Mario Rizzo : No. National General is a core part of transformative growth. The reason we acquired National General was to, first and foremost improve our competitive positioning in the independent agent channel and we have done that. With the business, we got a very well run non-standard auto business that we have continued to grow and grow profitably over the last several years. We are in the, I will say, early stages of rolling out what we call Custom 360. As I mentioned, that\u2019s the standard and preferred auto and homeowners offering. So we think there\u2019s significant opportunity in the independent agent space. When you look at the size of the National General business when we bought it compared to what it is now, our total IA presence, say, at the beginning of 2021 was a little over $5 billion, which included National General plus the Allstate independent agent business, as well as the encompass business. It\u2019s over $9 billion currently. So we have had a lot of success in that channel and we think there\u2019s just a ton of opportunity both in non-standard auto, but in standard preferred homeowners in the IA channel, and we expect to continue to capture that opportunity and that\u2019s a core part of how we are going to grow and a core part of the transformative growth strategy. Gregory Peters : Got it. Thank you for the answers. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Your question please. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning. I want to stay on the line of growth, if I can. So based on the expectation that Allstate will be better competitively positioned in 2024? Like, how quickly and aggressively can you pivot a growth and is it more a matter of improving the retention rates, which I would think would be pretty quick or is it more about the ability to pivot to new business? Tom Wilson : Well, how quickly will depend what happens in the marketplace, Yaron. So, I fully expect that Progressive and GEICO are going to spend more money in advertising and seeking to grow this year based on where their profitability is. State Farm has also been aggressive in trying to grow. Although they still have to improve their price position so that they are earning profit. But I expect it to continue to be a competitive environment. But you are right about the -- and then, it will just be how effective are we versus them. We feel -- Mario showed you the numbers, where two-thirds of the country were like all systems go. When you add in California, that\u2019s another big chunk. So we think we have got plenty of open fields, so to speak, to run in and to compete with transformative growth. We have validated a lot of the underlying assumptions, but we have yet to bring it to market in a consolidated way in particular states with all of our channels, that\u2019s on Mario\u2019s list to do this year. So we feel good about those opportunities. So we will grow as fast as we can and still make sure we have a good combined ratio. Mario, what would you add to that? Mario Rizzo : Yeah. I think that\u2019s a comprehensive answer, Tom. And I think the short answer, Yaron, is it\u2019s going to be both through retention and new business acquisition. And certainly, as we said earlier, as more states get into the right zone from a margin perspective, we would expect the amount of rate we need to take in those states to diminish. That\u2019s really, again, as Tom said earlier, is going to be a function of what the future loss trend looks like, but having to take less rate is a good thing from a retention perspective and we will continue to focus on that. And then in terms of new business, as we begin to invest in more states and do things like unwinding some of the restrictive underwriting actions we had to take to limit growth, invest in marketing and take full advantage of the broad distribution capabilities we have built across the Allstate exclusive agency system, direct and independent agent. We think we can fully leverage all the things we have been building with a better competitive position to help drive growth. But timing will be dependent on state-by-state, market-by-market, and influenced in large part by the competitive marketplace we are going to be operating in. Yaron Kinar : Thanks. And then maybe as my follow-up, tying the appetite to grow as much as you can profitably to the question of capital. You talked in the past and even on this call, about the -- about maybe selling the Health and Benefits business, you talked about the stop loss that you were looking to maybe purchase last year. Do you need to take any of these actions or other strategic actions in order to satisfy the growth appetite or do you have all the capital you need to grow as much as you want today? Mario Rizzo : No. We don\u2019t have to take any of those actions, we have plenty of capital and we have plenty of capital today. When you look at our earnings power, we will have plenty of capital to fund whatever growth we think we can achieve. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your question please. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the holdco cash. It did go up in the quarter. Did you guys take a dividend out of AIC or another entity in the third quarter. Jesse Merten : Good morning, Elyse. It\u2019s Jess. So as it relates to holdco cash, you can see that it went up from the prior quarter and this was really in accordance with our normal practice of moving capital around to maximize flexibility. So what we did do is move some capital up from a statutory legal entity was not AIC. But we moved some money out from statutory legal entities, as well as a few dividends out of non-insurance companies into the holding company. I know when we have talked in prior quarters, we had a few insurance companies that had fair amount of capital in them and didn\u2019t have risk, because the risk was all reinsured into the Allstate Insurance Company, so sort of in the normal-course of creating flexibility, we looked at those entities and move some of that surplus up to the holdco in the quarter. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my second question is on policy growth, but on the Nat Gen side, right? You guys have been showing on as growth slow within Allstate brand. You have been showing pretty strong growth within Nat Gen policies in-force. Just hoping to get some color there as you have kind of put way through books like what\u2019s been driving the growth within NAT Gen and how should we think about that continuing from here? Mario Rizzo : Yeah. Hi, Elyse. It\u2019s Mario. So most of the growth that we have been experience in the National General has been in the non-standard auto space. And as you know, that\u2019s a part of the market that\u2019s had a lot of disruption competitively where a lot of carriers have really pulled out or certainly slowed their growth. With National General, we have taken the same approach from a profit improvement perspective as we have in Allstate, we have taken almost 23 points of rate over the last two years in National General. The non-standard auto book intends to turnover quickly, so you can reprice the book on a continual basis. And so we have stayed in that market, we generated meaningful growth in non-standard auto and we are comfortable with the margins that we are experiencing in that in that book of business and look to continue to grow that. On top of that, as I said earlier, we are rolling out the Customer 360, which is going up market. In the IA channel to write standard preferred auto and homeowners. Again, early stages there. The good news is, that product is in 16 states, we are getting good traction and it accounts for in the fourth quarter, it was about 70% of our standard auto and preferred new business production in the IA channel. We will expand that into additional states throughout the course of 2024 and into 2025. So we think that will be an additive opportunity in the IA space. But we are comfortable with what we have been writing non-standard auto and National General, we think there\u2019s an additive opportunity as we look to really leverage Allstate\u2019s capabilities in the middle-market to expand National General in that space in the IA channel. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Bob Huang from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Bob Huang : Hi. Good morning. Just a quick question on the capital side, obviously, your capital now, it seems to be very sufficient. Curious as to how you think about the path to resuming buybacks, especially given the material rebound in capital levels so far? Tom Wilson : So -- hi. This is Tom. I am going to start. Our capital is always been sufficient. So it should like reiterate what the position we have had. As it relates to buybacks when we are looking at capital regenerate. We start with, first, making sure we have enough capital to run the business and to grow the business and we have -- had put aside more capital for growth, given the dramatic increase in premiums and the risk and we think by transformative growth. We will continue to have opportunities to deploying capital and high ROEs in fact growth. So that\u2019s the first thing we do is like how do you drive shareholder value. And so, I think, looking forward with those opportunities, we will have less capital than it\u2019s for share buybacks that we had historically. That said, we have a strong track record of buying shares back. I think, I don\u2019t know, since I have been CEO, maybe it\u2019s $30 billion worth of shares we bought back. Like, if we don\u2019t have a good use for the capital. Then we will give it back to shareholders, because there\u2019s no sense holding onto extra capital. But between growth in the Property-Liability business, growth in some of our Protection Services, they tend to be a little lighter in terms of capital needs. And then our investment portfolio we derisked our investment portfolio last year, because of what we didn\u2019t see as great market opportunities and if we saw there was opportunities to put more risk into that portfolio that would be another use of capital. So I think -- the think about capital we are always trying to manage and maximize shareholder value and we will do that -- do whatever form that is best. Bob Huang : All right. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful and apologies for misstating the capital side of things. Tom Wilson : Okay. That\u2019s fine. So my second question really is on the expense. So one thing we hear typically from litigation lawyers is that, well, social inflation is an issue because insurance companies, carriers tend to under underfunded claims departments and often have inexperienced claim staffing. As you think about expense save going forward and as we think about re-pivoting back to growth, can you maybe help us think about what areas within expenses are you cutting and what are the areas where it is very critical and then things that are you are not going to cut on the expense side, is it possible to provide some colors? Tom Wilson : Let me maybe address the litigation fees. Mario, can talk about expenses in claims. And then if you want, we can go above that in claims, already share just folks on claims. I am not shocked that lawyers would say that the only reason they exist is because we don\u2019t have good people settling claims. That\u2019s just not true. We -- bodily injury claims are where our customers get into an accident and hurt somebody else, we take those very seriously. We try to resolve those quickly. We try to make sure people get a fair amount. So I don\u2019t think I have seen any systemic changes either in the way we do it or the way the industry does it. I will say there have been a couple of things that have led to increased number of suits and litigation. First is, there\u2019s just more severe accidents. So during the pandemic, people started driving faster. They keep driving faster. And so when you look at the severity of the accidents, severity is up, and when severity is up, people tend to get hurt more, and when people get hurt more, they tend to have more damages, and that leads to a greater increase in the use of lawyers to help them resolve their claims. So that part seems completely natural to me. There\u2019s, obviously, been a big change in the way those litigation firms go to market. I don\u2019t know, obviously, but if you look at their advertising spend today, it\u2019s over $1 billion a year. So they are out looking for customers. Some of those are people who need their help because they have been in severe accidents and there are more of them. Some of them are people that maybe don\u2019t need as much help. They have also gotten much more sophisticated in the use of data and analytics, and trying to hunt down claimants and possible clients. Some of that would be good. Some of that -- we are not so sure they are actually doing what they are supposed to be doing. So I think it\u2019s just a process, like, we want to make sure people get the right amount, we don\u2019t want them to get too little and we don\u2019t want them to get too much, we work to do that. You saw, we mentioned in the release for sure that we have also been settling claims faster. I guess we mentioned it in a presentation as well. So to counter that, what we have found is that if we can put more resources on a claim, settle it faster, then people are less likely to feel they need to go get a lawyer. They are happy, we are happy and it\u2019s cheaper for everybody because nobody has to pay the 30% to attorneys. Mario, do you want to talk more about claims, maybe bodily injury, other claim expenses? Mario Rizzo : Yeah. I guess where I start is, as we talked over the last really couple of years about our profit improvement plan, it\u2019s multidimensional, and one dimension that we have continued to focus on is just improving claim operational execution. The fact is, as much as continuing to reduce our cost structure improves our competitive position, really operational excellence and claims is another way to make sure that, we pay what we owe, but that also will translate into better competitive position over time. So we are focused on really, I would say, all elements of the claim process. It\u2019s people, it\u2019s process, it\u2019s technology, analytics. And we are going to invest in the claims process moving forward across all those dimensions to just continue to invest in terms of people, making sure we have the right adjuster capacity. We went through a pretty significant turnover. It was really in 2022. That has largely subsided. So we have much more stability in terms of claim staffing, but we are focused on training claim staff and providing them the tools, both in bodily injury and in physical damage to operate in a way that, again, we pay what we owe, but we ensure that we eliminate any leakage in the system and again, that\u2019s been a core part of the profit improvement plan going forward. We are investing in people to provide more oversight, get more eyes on cars in the physical damage side, do a much more effective job in terms of total loss evaluation on the injury side. Tom mentioned we are paying claims faster. We have reduced our pending inventory on the casualty side to the lowest level it\u2019s been since well before the pandemic. We think that continues to reduce reserve risk going forward. So I would say, really, the answer is, we are going to continue to invest in claims broadly, because we just do believe it\u2019s a core part of enabling us to be more competitive and ultimately translate into growth. Tom Wilson : Let me link this to Greg\u2019s question as well, because I think sometimes when we set goals out there and we talk about specific line items in the P&L, we don\u2019t always show the subtleties of how they are linked together. So we clearly have a goal to reduce expenses related to transformative growth so we can be a low cost provider. That said, we -- that\u2019s not our primary goal. Our primary goal is to treat our customers really well, to build a great long-term business platform and to settle our claims and run our business properly. So if it means we have to spend more money on claims personnel, so that we lower, so loss costs come down and we think that\u2019s in the best interest of our shareholders and our customers, then we are going to do that even if the expense number goes up. So we put those numbers out there to help you say we are let you know we are managing them, but we are not captured by just that one-line item. Bob Huang : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your question please. Josh Shanker : Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. Once upon a time you think about combined ratio guidance and now you talk more about ROE guidance, which is sensible. But I look at the results in homeowners and they are quite volatile and good this quarter. I want to know where we stand in terms of pricing adequacy broadly for the homeowners\u2019 line. But more importantly, I want to see pricing adequacy for bundlers, I assume that you have a pricing adequacy for monoline drivers and it\u2019s different for the bundlers. Are we at a point where you are very happy to take unbundles at a nice level of profitability today? Tom Wilson : I will let Mario take on the bundling question, because we are really happy about that. Let me just -- in terms of the homeowners\u2019 business, we really like the business. It\u2019s -- you see -- look at our six-year combined ratio before this year, it was 92 and so really high return on equity, it\u2019s a great combined ratio. If you look at our underlying combined ratio this year, which excludes catastrophes, it\u2019s come down from last year. Obviously, we had a bad two quarters -- bad two quarters doesn\u2019t make a bad business. So we still really like the business, we have raised prices in the low-teens this year from a variety of different ways. So we like that business. If cats is the first two quarters are indicative of where we go in the future, our cats were up $2.5 billion this year versus the prior year. So if that\u2019s the case. I am confident we have the business model, which will adapt to it. We might not catch it before it, you won\u2019t catch it before it happens, but we haven\u2019t really great go-to-market business, so we are really happy with the homeowners\u2019 business. Mario, do you want to talk about returns in the homeowners\u2019 business and then the bundling question. Mario Rizzo : Yes. So, Josh. On -- in terms of overall rate adequacy. Obviously, through the combination of the rates we have taken over the last couple of years, plus the inflation and replacement values in homes, that\u2019s really fueling a pretty consistent and significant low-teens increase in average premiums. So this quarter that was about 12.5%, so we are seeing price flow through the system. And that doesn\u2019t include, because as you know, with a 12-month policy, it takes 24 months to earn it all that rate. So a lot of the rate we took in 2023 we have yet to earn and we are going to we are going to keep at it in terms of staying on top of loss cost. The underlying combined ratio for the year was 67 improved by about 3 points, mid 60s is where we would like that number to be. So we are getting closer to that, we have more rate that\u2019s going to earn in, and as Tom mentioned, we feel really good about our capabilities in homeowners and we are going to continue to lean-in and look to grow that business. From a bundling perspective, just 80% of our homeowners\u2019 customers have a supporting line are bundled. That\u2019s a pretty meaningful number and it happens at discount, it\u2019s upwards of 15%. And again, what we think with that pricing the lifetime value of that bundled segment is substantial and we will write bundled customers all day long. Our agents are writing bundled business at an all-time high level north of 70% of new business we are incenting agents to write that, we are seeing more bundled business come through our call centers and our direct business. And as I talked earlier Custom 360 going up market is both in auto and home offering. So we think we are well-positioned across all three channels to continue to attract bundled business that we can be even more competitively priced and because of the discounting element, but also it\u2019s a segment that we think generates substantial lifetime value and we are good at it, so we are going to keep that. Tom Wilson : Hey, Josh. I know you are a student of our competitors. So you see both GEICO and Progressive talking more about bundling in their advertising. They obviously see also good customers there. Our difference is we expect to make money in homeowners. Josh Shanker : And if I just close upon that, even though we are going to see some modest decline in auto policy count due to price increases and turning the book a little bit, are you net growing bundlers every day? Tom Wilson : I think we probably don\u2019t give that number out, but let\u2019s just say, we have a high focus on bundling, our agents are doing more bundling these days because we changed the way in which we reward and compensate them. So we are continuing to hunt down. Brent Vandermause : I think we have time for one more question, is that. Operator : Certainly. One moment for our final question then. And our final question for today comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from TD Cowen. Your question please. Andrew Kligerman : Hey. Thanks for sweeping me in at the end. Quick -- maybe some quick questions here. With regard to the impacts of unwinding the restrictions and increasing advertising, could you give us a sense of the impacts of each on the combined ratio? Tom Wilson : Well, I think, the first -- the principal impact of unwinding underwriting restrictions will be to kind of increase the aperture of the types of risks that we will be willing to write. Again, now that in the states that we are going to do that, we feel better and good about our rate adequacy and that\u2019s true across segments. So we have a pretty sophisticated approach to pricing where the prices accurately reflect the specific risks of each individual segment. So as we write more business, it\u2019s going to be written at what we believe to be a rate adequate level. Now, from a new business perspective, as we increase the volume of new business, that does tend to write or run a higher loss ratio due to renewal relativity going forward. So it will have some impact on our overall combined ratio going forward. But we take that into account in terms of how we manage the business. But we don\u2019t open the underwriting restrictions until we are comfortable with the rate level we are at. We price each risk according to its unique characteristics. Having said that, there is a new business penalty associated with higher new business volume. But again, we factor that in in terms of how we manage the overall combined ratio in the business. Andrew Kligerman : Got it. And then with regard to severity, just to make sure I am clear on it, you talked about 8% to 9% in 2023. Is that what you are anticipating for 2024 and how are you thinking about frequency as well going into the year? Mario Rizzo : We don\u2019t do a forecast for either frequency or severity on a go-forward basis. I would say it\u2019s whatever it is, we will make sure we get priced for it. Andrew Kligerman : Okay. Thank you. Tom Wilson : Okay. Thank you all for spending time with us this quarter. Obviously, with the sun shining a little bit and a few less cats, it gave you the opportunity to see the benefits of all the hard work the team\u2019s been doing to improve profitability in auto insurance and making sure we keep our homeowner business strong. We didn\u2019t really get to our other businesses, but they also continue to do quite well and our investment portfolio and team had a great year when you look at our total returns. So we feel good about where we are going forward. Thank you and we will see you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, please be aware that this call is being recorded.  And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Brent Vandermause, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Brent Vandermause : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, and welcome to Allstate's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Yesterday, following the close of market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted today's presentation, along with our reinsurance update on to our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results and our strategy. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2023 and other public documents for information on potential risks.  Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would also like to provide an update on our monthly financial disclosures since early 2022, and implemented rate actions from the prior month have been included in our monthly release and disclosed on our Investor Relations website to provide additional transparency on our proactive response to the rapid rise in loss costs. Going forward, our implemented rate disclosures for auto and homeowners insurance will be disclosed on a quarterly basis instead of monthly within our investor supplement.  And now I'll turn the call over to Tom. Thomas Wilson : Good morning. Thank you for investing your time and have interest in explaining why Allstate's such an attractive [indiscernible]. And then Mario and Jesse are going to walk through the operating performance. And then as Brent mentioned, as there we'll have time for Q&A.  Let's begin on Slide 2. Allstate strategy has 2 components, which is shown on the left there, increased personal property-liability market share and expand protection provided to customers. On the right-hand side, you can see the highlights for the quarter. So we generated net income of $1.2 billion in the first quarter. The profit improvement was broad-based. It reflects successful execution of the auto insurance profit improvement plan, attractive homeowners' insurance margins, and they also benefited from lower catastrophe losses in this quarter. Net investment income was up almost 33%, reflecting the 2022 and 2023 repositioning into longer duration, higher fixed income yields and then yields also went up some. And We had good performance-based valuations this quarter as well. Protection Services also had a good quarter, and that was led by Protection Plans and Roadside Services; if you go; down to the bottom, what do we do from here, we have a broad approach to further increase shareholder value.  First improving auto profitability in underperforming states will increase returns. Secondly, we're focused on increasing policies in force under the Allstate brand while continuing to expand National General. Mario is going to talk about that in a few minutes. Allstate's integrated approach to investing has and will continue to create value for shareholders. Expanding protection services will benefit both our customers and shareholders. And then the sale of the Health and Benefits business to a buyer that can further leverage our success will create more shareholder value. Although I'd point out, it will have a short-term negative impact on return on equity. Let's review the broad-based profit improvement on Slide 3. So revenues were $15.3 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 10.9% increase in Property-Liability earned premium and that, of course, was primarily due to kick rate increases in both auto and homeowners insurance. Over the last 12 months, property-liability written premiums have increased by almost $5 billion on an annual basis. Net investment income in the quarter was $764 million, or $32.9 for the prior year, and that reflects those higher fixed income yields and the duration extension I just mentioned. The strong profitability in the quarter generated adjusted net income of $1.4 billion or $5.13 per diluted share. Now let me turn it over to Mario to go through property liability results. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Tom. Let's start on Slide 4. Property-Liability earned premium increased 10.9% in the first quarter, driven by higher average premiums. Underwriting income was $89 million, the combined ratio of 93%, which improved by 15.6 points compared to prior year was driven by higher premiums earned, improved underlying loss cost trends, lower catastrophe losses and operating efficiencies. The chart on the right depicts the components of the 93 combined ratio. Lower catastrophe losses of $731 million were 8.8 points favorable to the prior year quarter, reflecting milder winter weather.  The underlying combined ratio of 86.9% improved by 6.4 points compared to the prior year quarter. The improvement was driven by higher average premium and moderating loss cost increases. Expense reduction programs also benefited results more than offsetting higher advertising spend. Prior year reserve reestimates, excluding catastrophes, had only a small impact on results. Favorable development in personal auto and homeowners insurance largely offset increases in personal umbrella liabilities and commercial auto reserves for the transportation network contracts we began exiting in late 2022.  Now let's take a closer look at auto insurance profitability on Slide 5. The first quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 96 improved by 8.4 points compared to the prior year quarter, showing that our profit improvement plan is working. The left chart shows quarterly underlying combined ratios. You will remember, we showed this chart last year, which adjusts 2022 and 2023 quarterly reported figures to reflect the updated average severity estimates as of the end of each respective year. As you can see, the underlying combined ratio improved sequentially in each of the last 5 quarters to 95.1% in the first quarter of 2024.  The chart on the right shows that in the first half of 2023, premium increases in dark blue were being offset by higher underlying losses and expenses. Profits began to improve in the third quarter of 2023 as premiums outpaced loss and expense increases and this continued in this year's first quarter. The slight first quarter drop in underlying loss and expense reflects lower claim frequency that benefited from milder weather and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by higher severity. Relative to the prior year quarter, average underlying loss and expense in the first quarter of 2024 was 6.7% higher as you can see at the top of the table. This reflects higher current year incurred severity estimates, primarily driven by bodily injury coverage, which was partially offset by lower accident frequency and the favorable impact on current year severity of favorable prior year reserve development in the Allstate brand.  Given the impact that good weather had on frequency in the quarter, favorable frequency may not persist as the year progresses. While auto margins have improved due to our price improvement actions we remain focused on ensuring that rate levels continue to keep pace with underlying cost trends driving improved profitability in those states not yet achieving target margins.  Slide 6 shows how auto profit improvement supports pursuing policy growth. As shown on the left, Allstate brand implemented rate increases exceeding 16% in both 2022 and 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, we implemented rate increases of 2.4% to keep up with the cost trends and improve margins in states not achieving target margins. The chart on the right depicts the Allstate brand auto proportion of premium in states with an underlying combined ratio of below 96%, shown by the dark blue bars. As more states have achieved target returns, we have started to increase marketing investment, both nationally and in those states. Slide 7 shows that while Allstate brand policies in force decreased compared to prior year, albeit at a slower rate than last quarter, over half that decline was offset by growth at National General. On the left, you can see that total protection auto policies in force decreased by 2% and compared to prior year due to a decline of 5.2% in the Allstate brand, reflecting the continued impact of auto insurance profit improvement actions. Underneath this decline is the positive impact of higher Allstate agent productivity and direct channel sales. Customer retention in the Allstate brand also continued to improve, and that improvement has a significant impact on growth trends. Allstate brand auto retention of 86% improved by 0.3 points compared to prior year, as the negative impact of large rate increases in 2022 and 2023 begins to moderate.  As we discussed last quarter, we received approval for rate increases in the profit challenge states of California, New York and New Jersey, which were affected this quarter. Renewal trends in those states were stable in the first quarter, but the full impact on customer retention had not yet impacted growth. Allstate brand new business also increased 7% versus the prior year, reflecting more advertising and increased Allstate agent productivity and direct sales.  National General was another positive to growth. Policies in force increased by 12.6% over the prior year due to an increase in nonstandard auto insurance and the continued rollout of a new middle market standard and preferred auto insurance product, also known as Custom360.  Slide 8 summarizes homeowners insurance profitability, which generated strong returns in the quarter. Homeowners insurance provides a differentiated customer experience and represents an additional growth opportunity across channels. The chart shows the homeowners combined ratio over time, achieving a 10-year average of approximately 92. The first quarter combined ratio of 82.1 translated to $564 million of underwriting income and improved 36.9 points compared to prior year, primarily driven by lower catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 65.5 also improved by 2.1 points due to higher average premium and lower noncatastrophe claim frequency.  Allstate Protection homeowners generated double-digit written premium growth compared to prior year, reflecting higher average gross written premium per policy and policies in force growth of 1.4%. Allstate agents continue to bundle auto and homeowners insurance at historically high levels. And National General's Custom360 product offers additional growth opportunities in the independent agent channel. Allstate has created an industry-leading business model, and we remain confident in our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns.  Moving to Slide 9, let's discuss the property liability growth opportunities. Starting on the first row. Improving customer retention remains key to improving our growth trajectory. Auto retention levels have stabilized and sequentially improved over the last two quarters and homeowners retention improved 0.8 points to the prior year quarter. Our agents and employees continue to guide customers through the renewal process by offering coverage options and ways to save through innovative programs and discounts like Drivewise and Milewise telematics offerings.  Growth can also be increased by easing new business restrictions. As rate adequacy has been achieved in more states, restrictive underwriting policies have been unwound in states representing more than 75% of Allstate brand auto premium. Increased Allstate brand advertising is also expected to increase growth. The components of transformative growth are being implemented to create sustainable growth. An improved competitive position will result from further expense reductions.  Expanded customer access comes from increased Allstate agent productivity, enhanced direct distribution and the expansion of Custom360 to more independent agents. A new Allstate brand, affordable, simple and connected auto insurance product is available in 9 states on the direct sales side. Online quote completion time has been reduced by 40% to less than 3 minutes within the new technology ecosystem. This platform will be expanded to the Allstate agent channel this year into more states and homeowners over the next several years. With these growth levers, Allstate is positioned to generate sustainable, profitable growth.  Now I'll turn it over to Jesse to talk about other operating results. Jesse Merten : Thank you, Mario. I'm moving to Slide 10, let's discuss the increase in investment income. Before we dig into specifics, let me reiterate that our active portfolio management includes comprehensive monitoring of economic conditions, market opportunities, interest rates and credit spreads by rating, sector and individual names. We seek to optimize return per unit of risk across the enterprise. This approach to portfolio management continued to benefit results in the quarter. Net investment income shown in the chart on the left totaled $764 million in the quarter, which is $189 million above the first quarter of last year. Market-based income of $626 million shown in blue was $119 million above the prior year quarter as the fixed income portfolio continues to benefit from repositioning into longer duration and higher yielding assets that have sustainably increased income. Performance-based income of $201 million shown in black was $75 million above the prior year quarter due to higher valuation increases and was above the trend that we have seen in recent quarters but lower than 2022.  The performance-based portfolio is constructed to enhance long-term returns and volatility on these assets from quarter-to-quarter as expected. Total portfolio return of 0.5% for the quarter and 4.8% for the last 12 months which is shown in the table below the left chart indicates that a balanced approach to risk and return creates shareholder value. The chart on the right shows changes made to the bond portfolio duration in comparison to interest rates over time. Higher income this quarter reflects increases in duration as inter rates rose in 2022 and 2023. The table below the chart shows fixed income portfolio earned yield was 4.1% at quarter end, but 0.7 point increase compared to 3.4% for the prior year quarter.  Slide 11 breaks down the growth and profit performance of the Protection Service businesses. Revenues in these businesses increased 12.2% to $753 million in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter. This result is mainly driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans, which increased 20.5% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting expanded product breadth and international growth. In the table on the right, you will see adjusted net income of $54 million in the first quarter increased $20 million compared to the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to 2 businesses. Profitable growth in Allstate Protection plans resulted in adjusted net income of $40 million, representing an increase of $12 million compared to the prior year quarter, higher revenue and improved claims trends benefited the bottom line. Allstate Roadside had adjusted net income of $11 million, driven by increased pricing, improved provider capacity and lower costs.  Shifting to Slide 12, the Health and Benefits business continued to perform well. For the first quarter of 2024, revenues of $635 million increased by $52 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by premium growth in individual and group health in addition to higher fees and other revenue in those businesses. Adjusted net income of $56 million in the first quarter was consistent with the prior year quarter as individual health fee income growth was offset by lower employer voluntary benefit income.  On Slide 13, we'll wrap up our prepared remarks where we started by reiterating Allstate's strategy and opportunities to increase shareholder value; improving auto insurance profitability, pivoting to growing auto and homeowners' policies in force, proactive risk and return management of the investment portfolio, expanding Protection Services and completing the sale of Health and Benefits, which we expect to occur in 2024.  With that context, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Jamminder Bhullar : So my first question was just on your views on PIF growth. And I realize it's going to be challenging in the near term, just given price increases. But with the expense cuts and coming through and once you're done with repricing, do you think that it's reasonable to assume that you'll have positive growth beginning sometime later this year or early next year in the auto business? Thomas Wilson : Jimmy, we do believe that it's time to pivot to growth that we has had restrict growth so we could get profitability up in the auto insurance business. We're not done with it yet, but we feel that the trajectory is good and we get a path forward on that. Mario went through the long list of various ways we can do it. First, of course, you just keep more of your existing customers. And then we have a bunch of other ways that we think we can grow new business.  When that will actually turn by quarter will be dependent on what happens in the marketplace. But it is, we believe, the really great opportunity to increase shareholder value because when you look at our valuation relative to a higher growth company like Progressive, it's -- there's a substantial discount. And we believe that this pivot to growth will drive more shareholder value. Mario, anything you want to add to that? Mario Rizzo : No, I think that covers it in. The only thing I'd say is in the Allstate brand, obviously, we continue to see the impacts of the profit improvement plan that we've implemented over the last couple of years. But we're starting to see, as Tom mentioned, some positive signs on retention as well as an uptick in production. And first, we need to see sequential growth before we'll get to annual year-over-year growth. And I think it's important to point out in National General. We continue to see really strong growth in that business, along with really strong profitability that we're encouraged by. And we think there's -- most of that growth in National General is coming in the nonstandard auto insurance business, we think there's an additive opportunity that we're going to continue to go after, as I mentioned, with Custom360. So opportunity across all brands and all channels going forward. Jamminder Bhullar : And can you talk about progress on the benefit sale? Obviously, from the outside, we haven't seen any movement. But -- and then just how you think about the deployment of the proceeds that come out of that sale? Jesse Merten : Jimmy, this is Jesse. So as it relates to the process, I would say things are progressing as expected on the pursuit of the divestiture. You'll remember we announced the intention to pursue the sale about 6 months ago, almost to the day. And as you might expect, there was robust interest from a large group of quality potential buyers on both strategic and financial. So diligence on a large complex business takes some time in so to selecting the right potential buyers to stay involved in the process. At this point, we're pleased with how the process is progressing, and we're confident that we'll be in a position to select a buyer that sees the same potential in the business that we do and is aligned with our strategic rationale for the sale. So we continue to pursue the divestiture as we said. And obviously, we'll let you all know as soon as we have a definitive agreement in place and offer more details at that time. Thomas Wilson : Jim, let me make a comment about the capital since it came up -- you mentioned that it came up at a number of the analyst write-ups last night. So first, we're very well capitalized. We've made that point consistently over the last couple of years. Obviously, the divestiture of health and benefits would free up additional capital. We're doing it because we believe it's the right way to harvest value, as Jesse pointed out. We think this is a great business that's shown up in the people who have been interested in buying it, but we also think that somebody else could do more with it than we can do with.it.  When you look at capital utilization, I would say that it's embedded in kind of a like from our strategy to enterprise risk and return to reinsurance to how we price homeowners insurance in a local market. And a couple of things I would say all those decisions are made with math, highly sophisticated math. So sometimes I think that confuses some people when we have more sophisticated math than things like premium surplus ratios.  But when we do that, we're looking at what the impact is economically and what the impact is on shareholder value. And we look at a really wide range of alternatives. First -- the first best opportunities of organic growth, given the high returns in our auto home protection plan businesses, we get really good returns there. And as I mentioned, we think that will drive increased valuation in the stock without earnings. After that, you said, well, share repurchase, a number of people asked about share repurchases. It's another thing that we look at. We've -- as you know, we bought back a lot of stock since we went public we've bought back almost $42 billion worth of stock, which is 83% of shares outstanding. If you look over the last 10 years, it's about half the shares and about $20 billion, you look over 5 years, that's 1/4 of the shares and about $10 billion. So we have no aversion to that. When you say, well, what kind of return do you get on that? Of course, it depends on what price you bought it at and what day you're marking it to market.  It is low point, it tends to look like cost of capital. Today, it looks like it's in the 10% to 14% range, depending on what period of time we look at. So that's a good return, one that we think benefits shareholders. On the other hand, it's not as good as at which we get from deploying it in those businesses. So deploying getting growth is why we believe that we have a whole bunch of other things we look at. We could increase the equity allocation and investment portfolio.  As we've told you, we're -- we have a bimodal approach there. About 60% is illiquid. We hang on to over ups and downs and 40%, it's liquid, we're down at the lowest level we've ever been in liquid equity securities. And we did it because we didn't like the risk in return. We're not trying to be a hedge fund, but we thought we had better places to put the money. We could decide we want to dial up there. Sometimes we put opportunity money in new capabilities, Arity.  If you look at Arity, we've now got 1.5 trillion miles of driving data. We're getting over $1 billion a week. We're expanding that from just pricing people who are our customers to pricing people before they become customers, which makes you be more efficient in marketing and advertising. Sometimes we acquire companies. So if you look at our protection plans business, it's like 10x its size and we bought it for $1.4 billion. We look at National General, we paid $4.1 billion, I think just -- and that's like double its size. So we did -- haven't done as well harvesting the value out of our identity protection business yet, but we're confident we got the right pick there that people are at greater risk, recently figure out how to grow it faster and make more money. So we have a whole bunch of opportunities that we look at. So I don't think you should just automatically default to something that falls into an easy analysis if you got the extra money to do share repurchases. No, we'll think about it hard. We'll do the right thing for shareholders, and then we'll make sure we're communicating with people. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from TD Cowen. Andrew Kligerman : Yes, it seems like your PIF growth is right around the corner of pivoting down only 1.4% year-over-year. So I'm wondering on the Allstate brand your expense ratio on advertising was 2.2%. Historically, if I look back at 2017 to '19, it was roughly 2.5%. So is there First question, is there much to go in terms of your ad campaigns? Or do you feel like you're kind of at a level where you need to be? Thomas Wilson : I'll let Mario talk about how he's reorganizing the business and really going to market in an integrated fashion to drive growth. As it relates to advertising, we don't like to give those numbers out just because we've got other people out there doing their advertising as well. What I will point out is one of the key components of transformative growth was improving our sophistication of customer acquisition. So no matter what percentage it is we want it to be more effective. But Mario, maybe you should talk about how you're changing your go-to-market. Mario Rizzo : Yes. Thanks for the question, Andrew. I guess where I start. First, the good news, as we pointed out, in the presentation as more and more states are achieving rate adequacy. And right now, in about 75% of the states we operate in, we've began to unwind underwriting restrictions. And to your point, begin investing in marketing to look to grow. The other thing we've done in anticipation of that opportunity, not only being there, but continuing to expand, is we're organizing ourselves in what we call go-to-market teams that are local market focused that are really intended to drive kind of bottoms-up opportunity, identification and capture again, at the local market level so that we can get the highest possible return on things like the marketing investments we're making, the continued expansion, up distribution as well as the growth opportunity that exists across channels in those states.  So we're early days in that, but we are putting behind our organization structure to be more focused on local market growth. And you remember, we manage this business state by state, market by market. So having local market insight, intelligence and the ability to move rapidly to capture opportunities is really going to be critical. And we think that alongside the expanded investment we're making in growth, will create significant growth opportunity for us going forward. Thomas Wilson : And we know that it works because we've used it for a long time. So -- and we dismantled some of it about 2 or 3 years ago when we were cutting expenses that didn't want to grow. And now that we're back into growth mode, we're just expanding what we know works. Adam Klauber : That's very helpful. And then the second question with regard to National General, just trying to get my arms around, how much growth potential there? How much of the book right now is nonstandard versus the Custom360s. The Custom360 relatively very small. And are those the right agents to generate big time growth on the more traditional or more standard products? Thomas Wilson : Well, we wouldn't give out that percentage in each, but you're correct. And then it's -- when we bought National General, it was mostly a nonstandard company. And we bought it for the strategic opportunity to leverage our capabilities in, which is called preferred auto and home insurance, and that's turning out to be true. Mario, maybe you want to talk about the success you're having with Custom360. Mario Rizzo : Yes. So Andrew, I guess the place I'd start is, first of all, we're really happy with the acquisition of National General. As Tom mentioned, we've effectively doubled the size of our independent agent business since we bought it in early 2021. And there's really 3 pieces to the business. There's the nonstandard auto piece, which is the by far the biggest component. And then there's what we call the legacy household business, which is think about our Encompass business that we integrated into it along with the legacy National General Standard Auto, Preferred and home business. And then there's Custom360.  And Custom360 is the new product offering. We're in about 17 states currently with the intent to expand pretty much into every state by the end of this year or into 2025. And we think that really represents an additive growth opportunity. The product offering itself is built on the Allstate product chassis. So think about the sophisticated rating plans that we have in standard and preferred auto in Allstate, the host and home product that we have in Allstate.  So those are the products that we're launching in the independent agent channel. And really, to your point, there's a different distribution, a different segment of the independent agent distribution system that we're looking to engage with to really grow that product portfolio. We're early stages. As I said, we're in 17 states. We're really encouraged by the early growth that we're seeing in the states that we've rolled out and more importantly, the agency engagement we're seeing on the IA side. We're going to continue to look to expand on that and leverage that going forward, but we're really optimistic around Custom360 and the opportunity beyond nonstandard auto and the IA channel. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Charles Peters : So for the first question, I'd like to just have you comment on both frequency and severity, frequency trends through the first quarter and sort of how you're thinking about severity for 2024, both inside the Allstate brand and also at NatGen. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Greg. This is Mario. I'm going to make some comments off the slide -- off of Slide 5 that we showed you in the presentation, which really shows the -- starts with the average underlying loss and expense trend that we saw in the quarter. That number is about 6.7%. If you take out the expense component, it drops by over 1 point. So I'd say the loss trend we're seeing in the protection business in the mid-5s, and that's made up of both frequency and severity. As we indicated, frequency relative to last year, just given the milder weather was favorable. And then the other component of it is severity. So it's, I'd say, favorable frequency more than offset by higher severity. But severity is continuing to moderate in terms of the rate of increase that we're seeing. Maybe a little bit of color underneath severity broadly because really, there's 2 different emerging stories both in physical damage and in injury. And physical damage, we continue to see the benefit of things like lower used car prices. Total loss severity continues to drop. But it continues to cost more to fixed cars, and that's made up of continually increasing parts prices and labor costs. So we've seen increasing severity and physical damage repairable -- for repairable vehicles, but not at the same rate we have been seeing before. That has moderated.  The real ongoing severity pressure is in beyond the injury side, which continues to run at higher than historical levels. That's driven by a lot of the things we've been talking about, medical treatments, medical consumption, inflation. It's also being driven by the fact that more of our customers continue to get sued and attorney representation levels continue to increase and that's putting pressure on severity. It's also resulting in higher cost for consumers ultimately. The cost to settle injury claims going up at the level that it is translating into higher insurance prices for consumers.  I'd point out a state like Florida, where last year, they passed meaningful tort reform, and we're starting to see some positive impacts of that tort reform, which I think will bode well for consumers going forward.  Georgia just -- the Georgia legislature just passed some tort reform, which, again, can be a positive for consumers going forward. And obviously, we're a strong proponent of that kind of reform broadening across more states going forward. But Greg, to your question, positive frequency in the quarter, hard to quantify with any degree of precision what the weather was worth, but it was favorable, offset with severity levels that are running lower than they have been running, but still at positive levels, which is why we're going to stay on top of pricing to make sure that our rates fully reflect loss trends and keep pace with loss trends in the states that we've reopened for growth and continue to pursue rates in states where we haven't achieved target profitability yet. And that would be true both in the Allstate brand and National General. Charles Peters : I guess in conjunction with that answer, you brought up rate. And I know you mentioned that you're not going to provide us updates on pricing going forward because you're rate adequate. I know -- if you go back to previous presentations, you've called out 3 states. And even after you reported fourth quarter, you still were I think New Jersey and New York were kind of still in the question mark period. Has there been some updates there in those 2 states that you want to give us that leads you to believe that they are rate adequate now too as well? Thomas Wilson : I'll let Mario go into the 3 states, but I just want to clarify. We decided not to give it to you every month because -- we don't -- we think you get to drill, you know what we're doing, and we don't need to do it. We didn't say we're very adequate so don't worry about it. We're always focused on it. We just didn't think we needed to like burden people sending out every month. Mario Rizzo : Yes, Greg, it's Mario. I'll just give you a little more color on those 3 states. Remember, last quarter, we told you we had just got an approval in the fourth quarter for auto rate increases in all 3 of those states. In California -- and we implemented those rate increases this past quarter. In California, we feel comfortable of where the rate level is with the increase, and we've reopened California for new business. really no change in New York and New Jersey in terms of our underwriting risk appetite, even with the rate approvals that we got late last year.  We still don't feel like we're at the appropriate rate level to want to grow in those two states. The only update I'd give you on one of the states is, New Jersey recently approved a 13.9% auto rate increase, which was one of the filings we had pending. That will be effective in the second half of this year. We're still going to need more rate beyond that before we would look to reopen that market. And in New York, we're having ongoing conversations around a pending rate that's with the department, but really nothing new to report at this point. And in those two states, in particular, we have not lifted any of the underwriting restrictions that we have in place. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Bob Jian Huang from Morgan Stanley. Jian Huang : Maybe just going back to the PIF growth and rates -- for Slide 6, if we look at the states that are above 96% combined ratio, I know that you talked about New York, New Jersey, California, but are there any other reasonably large states where you continue to need rates? And in those states, are you -- like comparing to your peers, is your loss ratio significantly above everyone else? Or in other words, if you were to raise rates in those states, do the customers have anywhere else to go? Thomas Wilson : Well, that's a complicated question. Let's see if I can address it. So in all states, when you have severities going up the way Mario described it. You're going to be increasing rates at levels above what is the general inflation rate. So we expect to continue to have to do that. If our customers quick and sued every time they get an access, then maybe it will back off some. But -- so we're always moving rate up. You're really get into where is your competitive position.  And I think it's difficult right now to determine where one's competitive position is in any individual state given how rapidly rates are moving and how they're moving through books of business, given how -- and so that said, we're confident that with transformative growth by reducing our expenses will end up in a lower cost, more competitive position than when we started this 4 years ago whatever place. It's just this blip in here where everyone is raising prices a lot, including us, as Mario pointed out, in auto alone, it was 16% in each of the last 2 years.  Homeowners is not -- it's slightly lower, but also has the same trends to it. So -- we feel confident that the product offering we have, the technology we have, the agents we have, the broad set of distribution that will enable us to grow. Price is clearly an important part of that. And we're focused on making sure we're competitive, but we're not going to not take rate so that we can grow. One of our big competitors, State Farm's picked up almost a couple of points of market share over the last couple of years because they chose to run fairly large underwriting losses that won't be us. Jian Huang : Okay. That's very helpful. But just curious, are there any other relatively large states outside of New York, New Jersey, California, where you still need rate at this point in time? Mario Rizzo : No. Like if you go back to Page 6 that you mentioned that the top bar on the right, the 26%, the vast majority of that is those 3 states : California, New York and New Jersey. And then the -- both the light blue and the dark blue, when you kind of add those together, and we talked about unwinding underwriting restrictions in about 3/4 of the states. Again, we base those decisions on rate adequacy versus kind of a backward-looking combined ratio.  And we feel good about where we're positioned the growth opportunity, and as we said a couple of times, we're going to stay on top of the loss trend in those states. But the states that are in that top section are the ones that we're going to continue to push incremental rate through because we're not at target margins yet. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question is on the auto. I guess it's more on the underlying loss ratio. I thought in the past, right, the first quarter would seasonally be a better quarter for just an auto book in general, but understanding rate increases that can earn in can kind of mask that as we go through the year. And then I'm also not sure if there was maybe some favorable non-cat weather in the Q1 numbers. So just can you give us a sense of the cadence would you expect on the underlying loss ratio within auto to improve as we go through the year given the rate to earn in? Or is there some seasonality or other factors that we need to consider? Thomas Wilson : Let me start, and Mario, you can jump in. First, you're correct in that first quarter is usually a better quarter in combined ratio in auto insurance than like the summer months when everybody is driving. To be able to do attribution of this current quarter versus other quarters and weather and how much -- what the sustainable [indiscernible] is really difficult to get it with any sort of precision. It's not that we don't try and we look at it when we come up with numbers, but they're not numbers that I would say would be for public consumption. What I would say is we feel really good about the trend in auto insurance profitability. As you point out, we got a lot more rates still coming through. We've gotten good control over our expenses. We're working hard on claims to try to deal with a high inflationary environment. Make, sure we keep costs down and not just accept that they have to go up at high single digits. So we feel really good about the trend, at least I don't know that I feel like one quarter makes a trend in that, I would say, this first quarter x percent was due to just some [indiscernible]. Mario, anything you would add to that? Mario Rizzo : Yes. I think, Elyse, the components you mentioned are the right ones. And while I can't -- I'm not going to give you the guidance on continually improving loss ratio going forward. What we do know are a handful of things. Number one, we took over 16 points of rate last year and another 2.4 points in the first quarter. That's going to continue to earn through the book, and you're going to continue to see average earned premium growth going forward. That's just based on the actions we've taken so far.  I talked a little bit about the loss trend earlier and where that was running -- we'll see how that plays out over the duration of the year. The only other piece I'd give you is the frequency component of that, there clearly is a weather benefit we got difficult to quantify. So the frequency benefit may or may not persist going forward. That would be the only thing in addition to just the Q1 seasonality that exists. But we feel good about where the earned premium trend is going and then we're obviously going to watch both components of the loss trend, and we're going to continue to push hard on expenses to drive cost out of the system, which will also help from a margin perspective. Elyse Greenspan : And then my second question, going back to earlier comments on the Health and Benefits transaction, is your plan still to expect to announce and close the transaction this year? And then I think based on your comments to a prior question, you implied right, that there was conversations with parties. It sounds like you're going down the route of one counterparty instead of perhaps maybe multiple. But can you just confirm, I guess, that that's the thought as well just to find one counterparty to buy the entirety of the business? Jesse Merten : It's a normal process, Elyse. We're not going to go through [indiscernible] it. We still think we'll sell it this year. A lot of people are interested in the business, and we're confident we made the right choice. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Yaron Kinar : Most of my questions have been asked, but I did want to dig a little deeper into NatGen, if I could, in the PIF growth there. So I understand you have the Custom360 that should drive further growth. At the same time, we also see maybe some competitive pressures rising in nonstandard auto, which may actually result in a little bit of a decrease in that segment's growth? Maybe you can help us think through the two combined. Thomas Wilson : I'll let Mario jump in, I know you're probably referring to Klauber's numbers. I'll let Mario jump in on state. But let me just mentioned something, I think kind of we talk about, but I'm not sure if it gets as much focus as I think it should, which is homeowners. The homeowners business is a really attractive business for us. We're really good at it. We have an integrated business model that you can see Mario showed the slide where we've earned a 92 combined ratio over a 10-year period. The industry dynamics today. A lot of that business is sold through independent agents, about half of it.  And industry dynamics are right for us to leverage that position. There's a great interest in independent agents and having what they call markets or we would call availability. And when you look at why that is, this is -- the first customer risks are increasing, right, whether that's inflation in home values, whether it's demographic trends, people moving in the way of where there's severe weather or just increased severe weather. So there's increased need for risks. And then at the same time, the industry has lost money.  So the industry lost money over the last 3 years, last 5 years, over the last 10 years, it made money but we made about 3/4 of that money. So the industry made about $10 billion over a 10-year period, and we made about 75% of that. So we're really good at it. And so we think that one of the ways to grow there is in the independent agent channel is by leveraging our homeowners. So we obviously can grow in homeowners in the Allstate agent channel. You see that our bundling stuff, whether you look at any of the industry reports, we're really good at bundling there.  And you see the PIF growth there even when auto growth is going down, which wasn't always the case. They used to trend more together, but we've got so much better at bundling. So that's -- I don't want to leave homeowners on the cutting-room floor, as it relates to growth, both in the National General channel and the Allstate channel. Mario, do you want to talk about that. Mario Rizzo : Yes. Thanks for the question, Yaron. Look, where I start is the National General nonstandard auto business is a really well-run business for us. And when we acquired NatGen several years ago, it allowed us to get into a business that Allstate was not in at that time in a particularly meaningful way. And we've been able to grow that pretty aggressively and grow it profitably. Over the last several years. Some of the ways we've been able to expand is we've expanded geographically, so we're in a lot more states with nonstandard auto now than when we bought the business. We've also expanded from a channel perspective, we allow Allstate agents to sell nonstandard auto through National General for business that's outside of Allstate's risk appetite. We sell it direct to consumer. So we've been able to expand the business, both geographically as well as across channels.  And the business has been subject to the same inflationary pressures that the standard and preferred auto business has been subject to. But we've stayed on top of rate need. We've taken a lot of rate over the last couple of years, I believe, over 15 points in the last 12 months. So we've stayed on top of the rate need. It's a business that you can effectively reprice most of the book almost every policy period, just given the deflection rates. And we've been able to, over the last couple of years, take advantage of the competitive dislocation in nonstandard auto as a number of carriers have backed off from that business.  We've taken advantage of that opportunity and taking advantage of by leveraging our capabilities in that space. And as much as the competition might be heating up there, we feel really good about our capabilities, and we're going to continue to look to grow that business as well as the standard preferred and homeowners that Tom talked about with Custom360. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : I had a question just on the brand auto PIF. So the brand auto PIF was down about 1.5% compared to the fourth quarter. And I guess I'm wondering how. And now is for the entire book, the entire brand auto book. I guess I'm wondering how that PIF growth trended versus the fourth quarter in the 64% of the book that is at target margins that you showed on Slide 6, are you guys growing PIF in that part of the book? Thomas Wilson : We wouldn't break those numbers out for competitive reasons. When it's big enough, so David, you could do math on it. So you could say, okay, here's when the churn is going to come. We would say it. But obviously, there are some markets, we're growing in other markets, we're not growing in. Some of those are markets. Some of those are states. When we get to the point where you can do the math to show when -- I know you -- I totally get where you're going because you want to figure out when the turn is. But we don't like to show what states were growing in at higher rates than others because then they get our competitors interested in going to those states. And we'd rather grow without having them be aware of where we're growing. David Motemaden : No, understood. It was worth a shot anyway. Just another question, just on the agent productivity. You gave some interesting stats last quarter that agent productivity was up 6% excluding California, New York, New Jersey. I'm just wondering how the productivity looked this quarter. Did that improve significantly? Or just how to think about that as a potential growth driver? Thomas Wilson : Let me go up to transformative growth and get Mario to talk about the specifics of your question. So as part of transformative growth, we said we want to improve customer value. And that meant getting our agents to really focus on there were those things that customers really want them to do for them, which includes helping them buy insurance. It doesn't necessarily include having them there when they have to pay a bill for retention.  They will pay for that, but they won't pay as much as they will for when they get to new business. So we shifted our compensation program to move to lower our cost for customers and better align it with what customers want to pay for. As a result of that, we both lowered distribution expense and we've had some agents who had the word -- had built business models on higher retention [indiscernible]. So our overall agent capacity in the Allstate brand has gone down. That said, to your point, productivity has gone up, and so our overall volume has been even better when you adjust for those 3 states that are not to be named. So Mario, do you want to go there? Mario Rizzo : Yes. Thanks for the question. So I think the short answer to your question is yes. We -- when you look at overall Allstate brand new business production is up about 6.5%. It was up both in the Allstate exclusive agent channel as well as direct. And then if you kind of carve out California, New York and New Jersey. Because you have to remember, the California rate wasn't effective until February. So we really didn't start opening things back up until the really the latter part of the quarter.  We're really pleased with how our agents are responding to the changes we've made that Tom talked about continue to invest in their businesses, continuing to drive higher levels of average productivity. And despite the fact that we have fewer agents and have restricted -- or have been restricting grown in 3 pretty significant states.  Overall productivity is increasing and absolute production is up. So we're really happy with the productivity levels of our agents. And as we look to accelerate growth going forward, they're going to be a core part of how we grow prospectively in addition to things we've been talking about with independent agents and the direct channel. Brent Vandermause : We'll take one more question. Operator : Certainly. And our final question for today comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from BMO. Michael Zaremski : I guess just I know there's been a lot of talk about growth. And the strategy has been clear you guys have successfully kind of transformed your expense ratio lower, which should help grow direct-to-consumer channel specifically. And I know Allstate has a ton of marketing expertise. But I'm just kind of curious, the direct-to-consumer -- customer, my understanding is a bit different than the average current Allstate customer. So is there -- are there any different strategies or maybe you kind of -- or just go slow to learn as you kind of grow into DC? Or anything you'd like to -- you think we should be thinking about there? Thomas Wilson : Yes. The first -- the direct customer does have different needs. So they necessarily want to pay for someone to help them buy insurance, which is why we price our direct insurance under the Allstate brand, cheaper than Allstate-branded insurance bought through an agent. Because we're trying to do exactly what our customers want. They also have different ways they want to interact with us. And so we've -- with our new Transformer growth and new tech stack, it's really everything from what's prepopulated into the thing to the offers it presents to the questions you required to.  As Mario talked about, we're down 40% in the time. We've been able to add other products to that flow and so increase things like roadside services and sell more products, which lowers our acquisition costs. So it is different. We're good at it, we could be better at it. And so we're working at getting better at it. About 2 years ago, we really reformed the business, put some new leadership in place and then are updating everything from the technology I talked about to also who you market to. So you mentioned they're direct, but some of the customers directly, that's where you go to. Like if you go to people who are shopping all time, then you will get higher risk drivers because they shop all the time as opposed to lower risk drivers don't shop as much. So it costs more to get the lower risk drivers on board. So we're working through how do we expand that. We believe that the direct channel has tremendous upside with us to serve those customers who want it that way not just on auto insurance, but things like home insurance and whether it's protection plans or what we're doing in. We get some stuff going on in the commercial space with direct.  So we think it's just another way the customer would interact. Often -- not a lot of homeowners is sold over direct. We'll see how successful we are. I believe we can. I mean, people buy houses direct. So like if your buyouts or probably buy a home insurance from us. And so there's a great upside. You will notice that when you look over the last couple of years, One of the first places we dialed down new business was in the direct channel. So it was down like 50% or 60%, I think in '23 or something. Because we wanted to make sure we maintained our agent force levels of compensation because they have businesses right and this is the revenue that comes into their business. We said, okay, well, this is a temporary window it's easier for us to concentrate that reduction in new business in the direct channel than it is to spread it amongst a bunch of agents who are now also trying to get through a new comp plan. That turned out to be a good choice. It gave us the opportunity to build new capabilities. And now we're hitting the gas side expanding direct. So you should expect to see our direct volume is go up higher as a percentage of new business than it has better in the past. Thank you all for joining us and investing your time in Allstate. We'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes the investor call. You can now disconnect. Good day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, please be aware that this call is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Brent Vandermause, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Brent Vandermause : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted related material on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team will provide perspective on our strategy and an update on our results. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2023 and other public documents for information on potential risks. As some of you know, this will be my final earnings call as the leader of our Investor Relations team since I will be transitioning to a new role. Investor Relations will be in the capable hands of Alastair Gobin, who will be a great partner for you all. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Well, good morning. Thank you for investing your time at Allstate. I'll provide an overview of results. Mario and Jess will go through operating performance, and then we'll address questions. Let's start on Slide 2. Allstate strategy has two components : increase personal property-liability market share and expand protection provided to customers, which are shown in the two ovals on the left. On the right-hand side, you could see highlights in the second quarter. Net income was $301 million in a quarter with elevated catastrophes. The auto profit improvement plan is being successfully executed. National General continues on a 4-year profitable growth trajectory. The Homeowners business had good results with an improved underlying combined ratio and underwriting profit for the first six months of the year. Net investment income was up almost 17% over the prior year quarter as the fixed income portfolio continues to benefit from repositioning into longer duration and higher yielding assets. Protection Services has had another good quarter led by profitable growth in protection plans. Let's move to Slide 3 and show how that operational execution improved underlying results in the quarter. Revenues increased to $15.7 billion, reflecting higher average property liability earned premiums and that was mostly from rate increases in auto and homeowners insurance and increased net investment income. Net investment income for the second quarter was $712 million higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting that fixed income duration extension in 2022 and 2023. And then which also included lowering public equity holdings to take advantage of higher fixed income yields. Adjusted net income was $429 million or $1.61 per diluted share. Now, I'll turn it over to Mario for Property-Liability results. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Tom. I'll start by covering Slide 4. On the top left of the table, you can see Property-Liability earned premiums of $13.3 billion increased 11.9% in the second quarter, driven by higher average premiums. The underwriting loss of $145 million improved by $1.9 billion compared to the prior year quarter due to improved underlying margins and lower catastrophes. The expense ratio of 21.3 was 0.8 points higher than prior year due to increased advertising as we continue to accelerate growth investments in rate adequate states and risk segments. The adjusted expense ratio, which excludes advertising costs and other non-core expenses was down 1.6 points in the quarter. The chart on the right depicts components of the 101.1 combined ratio. Catastrophe losses of $2.1 billion were 6.7 points favorable to the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 85.3 improved by 7.6 points compared to the prior year quarter with the improvement driven by higher average earned premium and moderating loss cost trends. Prior year reserve re-estimates, excluding catastrophes, had only a minor impact on current quarter results as favorable development in personal auto and homeowners insurance offset increases in personal umbrella liabilities and commercial auto reserves related to the transportation network contracts we began exiting in late 2022. Turning to Slide 5. You can see that we continue to successfully execute our profit improvement plan. The second quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 95.9 improved by 12.4 points compared to the prior year quarter. The bars in the chart show consistent improvement in the quarter underlying combined ratio. I will note that we have adjusted 2022 and 2023 reported quarterly figures to reflect the updated average severity estimates as of the end of each of those years to remove the volatility related to intra-year severity adjustments. You can see that the auto business has seen six sequential quarters of underlying combined ratio improvement with an underlying combined ratio of 93.5 in the second quarter of 2024. The dark blue line in the chart shows how rate increases throughout 2022 and 2023 pushed average premiums above underlying losses and expenses represented by the light blue line starting in the second half of 2023. As average premium increases have outpaced loss and expense profitability has improved. Relative to the prior year quarter, average underlying loss and expense was 5.5% higher, as you can see in the second row of the table. This reflects higher current year incurred severity estimates primarily driven by bodily injury coverage, offset by lower accident frequency as well as higher advertising investments. Physical damage severity increases continue to moderate, while bodily injury continues to trend above inflation. Our claims team is focused on operational actions to mitigate the impact of inflationary trends, including identifying injuries earlier in the claims process to improve overall cycle time and focus on fast and fair resolution. Let's review Homeowners insurance on Slide 6 which had improved underlying performance. Allstate is an industry leader in Homeowners insurance, generating low 90s combined ratios over the last 10 years, as you can see in the chart on the right. This performance compares favorably to the industry, which experienced an underwriting loss and a 103 combined ratio over that same time period. Moving to the table on the left. Allstate Protection homeowners written premium increased by 13.7% compared to prior year, reflecting both higher average gross written premium per policy and policy in force growth of 2.2%. The second quarter combined ratio of 111.5% resulted in $375 million of underwriting losses compared to the $1.3 billion loss in the prior year. The underlying combined ratio of 63.5 improved by 4.1 points due to higher average premium and lower non-catastrophe claim frequency, which more than offset modest increases in non-catastrophe severity. For the first six months of 2024, Homeowners insurance generated an underwriting profit of $189 million. Moving to Slide 7. Let's discuss Transformative Growth our multiyear strategy to create a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution. The 5 components of Transformative Growth are shown in the blue panels on the left side of the page, and we continue to make good progress on all of them. On the right-hand side, we show the tangible outcomes and proof points that we're delivering through this transformation, which improve the customer experience and support our objective to profitably grow market share over time. Two examples of those tangible outcomes that I'd highlight are the new affordable, simple and connected auto insurance product that was built on our new technology platform is now available in 19 states. And that in the second quarter, we increased our advertising investment by approximately $300 million to support growth efforts in states with attractive returns. Moving to Slide 8. We'll double-click on the multichannel distribution strategy, which enables us to serve customers based on their personal preferences. Our exclusive agents are available for local customers seeking personalized advice to fulfill broad insurance needs. Agency productivity has increased and bundling rates at point of sale are at all-time highs. Enhancements to direct capabilities and increased advertising attract more self-directed customers with new business production in the direct channel in the second quarter, nearly double that of the prior year. The National General acquisition significantly expanded the independent agent channel. If you look at the distribution of new business we write, shown in the pie charts on the bottom of slide, you can see the power of expanded customer access. The combination of broader distribution capabilities, increased advertising greater pricing sophistication and product expansion has resulted in a 90% increase in new business applications since 2020 with a much more balanced split across distribution channels. Now let's turn to Slide 9 to delve deeper into how the National General acquisition has allowed us to better serve customers who prefer to engage with independent agents. The $4 billion acquisition included a number of businesses, including personal auto insurance, group health, individual accident and health, and digital marketing platforms. Prior to the acquisition, we offered insurance in the independent agent channel through both the Allstate and Encompass brands, with the Encompass brand solely dedicated to selling through IAs. With the acquisition of National General, we now go to market in the independent agency channel, primarily through the National General brand. Through the ownership of National General since January of 2021, we have significantly increased the number of customers we protect through independent agents, having added almost 1.7 million policies in force reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 8% in policies over the past four years and bringing premiums written to over $5.1 billion for the first six months of this year. Underwriting margins remain attractive and National General is now one of the largest independent agent personal lines insurers with expansion into lower risk customer segments supporting additional growth going forward in the IA channel. Slide 10 reviews property liability policies in force for all brands. Given the successful execution of the Auto Insurance profit improvement plan, investments in growth will made in Allstate that offer attractive return opportunities. These higher growth investments led to a 17% increase in Personal Auto new business applications in the second quarter, as you can see at the top of the chart on the left. The green bars show the components of that growth in new policy sales. The first two bars reflect the drivers of the 23% increase in new business volume in the Allstate brand. Higher productivity per exclusive agents drove a 9% new business increase compared to prior year and advertising investments and enhancements to direct operations resulted in a 92% increase in the direct channel compared to the prior year. The last two green bars reflect national general growth in both the non-standard auto business and higher sales volume from the Custom360 middle market offering that we continue to roll out. On the right, you can see that total protection auto policies enforced decreased by 1.6% compared to prior year as the Allstate brand decrease was partially offset by growth at National General. Allstate brand auto policies in force decreased by 4.5% compared to prior year as policies lost from customer defections more than offset the increase in new policy sales. Allstate brand auto retention of 85.7 did improve by 0.2 points compared to prior year as the negative impact of large rate increases in 2022 and 2023 continues to moderate. National General growth of 548,000 policies in force offset almost 60% of the Allstate brand decrease. While margin improvement actions have negatively impacted policy growth, the were necessary to mitigate loss cost trends during a period of rapid loss cost inflation. And now I'll turn it over to Jess. Jess Merten : All right. Thank you, Mario. Slide 11 details profitable growth in Protection Services. In the second quarter, revenues in these businesses increased to $773 million, which was 12.7% higher than the prior year quarter. This result was primarily driven by growth in Allstate Protection Plans. Revenues in our Roadside business decreased 22.7% compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact of exiting a large unprofitable wholesale account. In the table on the right, you will see adjusted net income of $55 million in the second quarter increased $14 million compared to the prior year quarter, with most businesses showing improvements. Profitable growth in Allstate Protection plans resulted in adjusted net income of $41 million, a $10 million increase compared to the prior year quarter as revenue growth and improved claims trends continue to benefit the bottom-line. Slide 12 provides additional insight into the shareholder value created by protection plans. Since acquiring SquareTrade in 2017 for $1.4 billion, this has become a significant growth platform with scale and attractive profitability. Protection Plans provides warranties for a wide range of products, including consumer electronics, computers and tablets, TVs, mobile phones, major appliances and furniture. The power of the Allstate brand has helped to secure partnerships with large retailers in North America. We sell Allstate Protection Plans at point of sale through successful retailers such as Costco, Home Depot, Sam's Club, Target and Walmart, all under the Allstate brand. We're also expanding internationally into Europe and Asia. As you can see from the charts to the right, broad distribution and customer-focused operational execution has resulted in rapid growth in this business. Revenue grown 20% compared to the same 12-month period in 2023, while returns have been strong. Adjusted net income over the last 12 months totaled $139 million and almost $700 million cumulatively since 2017. Now let's shift to Slide 13 to discuss investment results. Result again benefited from active portfolio management that seeks to optimize return per unit of risk across the enterprise. Net investment income, shown in the chart on the left, totaled $712 million in the quarter, which is $102 million above the second quarter of last year. Market-based income of $667 million, which is shown in blue, was $131 million above the prior year quarter as the fixed income portfolio continues to benefit from repositioning into longer duration and higher yielding assets. Performance-based income of $107 million, shown in black, was $20 million below the prior year quarter due to lower real estate investment results. The performance-based portfolio is constructed to enhance long-term returns and volatility on these assets from quarter-to-quarter is expected. On the right, you can see our annualized portfolio return in total and by strategy over a short-term and long-term horizon. The market-based portfolio delivers predictable earnings while the performance-based portfolio enhances risk and return and diversifies the $71 billion investment portfolio. Moving to Slide 14. The Health and Benefits business continues to perform well. Revenues of $620 million increased by $45 million compared to the prior year quarter, driven by premium growth in group and individual health. Adjusted net income of $58 million in the second quarter was slightly higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting increased group health and employee benefits adjusted net income that was partially offset by a decrease in individual health. As a reminder, the decision to pursue a divestiture of these businesses was based on a belief that potential buyers with complementary products and capabilities will unlock value beyond what is achievable by Allstate. The process is progressing well and has confirmed our strategic logic. Slide 15 recaps Allstate strategy in this quarter's results. Auto and Homeowners insurance profitability has improved. National General is profitably growing policies in force. We're accelerating transformative growth to increase auto and homeowners' policies in force. Proactive risk and return management of the investment portfolio continues to generate value. And Protection Plans is expanding with broadened product offerings and distribution. We're confident that this strategy will continue to create value for our shareholders. And with that context, let's open the line for your questions. Operator : Certainly. And our first question for today comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please. Gregory Peters : Good morning, everyone. So for my first question, I'll focus on growth. And Tom, I know you've been talking about transformational growth now for several years. And we're seeing this strong increase in new issued applications. So I'm wondering if you might help us understand how you think that new issued application result is going to drive increased policies in force in the auto stats that we see in some of your supplements. Tom Wilson : Good morning Greg. Thank you for both being here and paying attention over years, appreciate it. Mario talked about the growth by channel. And we highlighted National General this quarter because it's a $10 billion business on an annual basis. And we feel like the market is really not looking through that one in terms of growth as much. Transformative growth includes what we're doing in National General. But to your point, it really also includes remaking a lot of the business processes inside the Allstate brand. So let me make a couple of comments about that. And give it to Mario to talk about specific things he's doing in various geographies. It's just the most macro view growth driven by two factors, sell more, as you point out and keep more. And so we spent a bunch of time Mario talked about selling more. We feel good about the trajectory there. You can see the benefits of the increased advertising and direct volume Mario talked about. And that also will translate into increased growth in productivity in the Allstate agent channel as we roll it out. So the other question then is, of course, how many do you keep? And retention was up slightly in the quarter versus the prior year quarter. If you kind of look over the last 12 months, it's been reasonably flat in Auto Insurance. I assume you're talking about Auto Insurance, by the way, we can talk about Home as well because I think that's a great opportunity for us. But on Auto Insurance, it's been relatively flat and normally, you would expect as rate increases come down, you would expect retention to increase. It's not clear what that trend will be at this point in time. And the reason I say that is not that I think traditional economics of don't ask me to pay a lot more and more likely to stay breakdown. It's just that the price elasticity curves broke down when we raised prices over the last couple of years. So it's a little hard to tell what the tail on that will be because it's hard to figure out attribution of why did in the face of 33% increase in rates we were able to hold retention pretty well. Some have been -- maybe car people understood the cars worth more, maybe they had a bunch of cash the government gave them. Some of it's competitors were also raising rates. So you can't really do attribution as to why we are where we are. So looking forward, we said it's a little hard to tell exactly what retention will do in the future. I take Senate goes up because we are taking fewer price increases. That's almost -- it's pretty close to one to one in terms of movement retention rate and growth, which is really a good thing, obviously. But we're not waiting around to see what happens there. We're working on improving the customer experience. We have a goal of growing 20 million customer interactions on an annual basis by next year, and we're well along the goal on that. So we're doing a whole bunch of continuous improvement. We've got new tech tools out there, new products, all of which are designed around improving retention and growth. Mario, do you want to talk about specific aspects of growth in terms of states or something? Mario Rizzo : Sure. Thanks for the question, Greg. So maybe the place I'd start like Tom said, retention is obviously critically important to growth, and we're pleased with the fact that retention is stabilizing. But we also recognize there's a handful of states that we have taken some pretty significant rate increases more recently, California, New York, New Jersey. Those are going to continue to have an impact on retention going forward. But absent those three states, we kind of like the trends that are emerging. But I want to talk a little bit about new business production and get at your question. So Greg, where I would start would be kind of how did we get here? And the reality is, as we've been implementing the auto profit improvement plan over the past couple of years, that's obviously being executed on a state-by-state, market-by-market basis. But as states have gotten to a rate adequate level, we've begun to lean in and invest more in growth to drive production in those states. And that would include things like unwinding underwriting guidelines to restrict business, increasing advertising spend, both nationally and locally. And as where we sit right now, as I'd say, about two-thirds of our states, the premium volume represented like two-thirds of our states, are what we would consider at profit target levels. And then there's about another 10% or so that are kind of on the path to getting there. So overall, we feel really good about the vast majority of country in terms of geographically where we're comfortable investing. And you see the momentum that's really been building over the course of the year. Last quarter, production was up about 9% in total. This quarter, it was up 17% as we further ramped up growth investments. And we're going to continue to do that. At the same time, you've seen us take less rate, which, as Tom mentioned, helps retention. But we're going to continue to be diligent about staying on top of loss cost trends really broadly across states. And as I mentioned, there are some states that aren't in that growth category right now that we've got to get to target levels of profitability. We're going to continue to focus on taking rates that are necessary there. And when we're successful, those will become additive to the parts of the country where we can invest. So that kind of got us to where we're at in terms of geography and new business and the good news is we're seeing the growth across brands and across channels. Gregory Peters : Great. I guess in a related question as a follow-up -- my follow-up would be on the expense ratio side. You called out the increased advertising expense in the second quarter. I think it was 3 points of your property liability combined ratio. When we look forward, what kind of expectation do you have about how maybe the adjusted expense ratio is going to move through the balance of this year and sort of what your longer-term objectives are there? Tom Wilson : Let me answer that both by first by going up and then coming down a little bit. So Transform Growth had 5 components that Mario walked through. We've -- on each of those, the underlying assumptions between whether that was a good thing to do or not, we've proven out. We haven't -- they all are not working all at the same time right now so that you're seeing the growth we think we can get, which is to increase market share. So we're confident we're going to increase market share in personal property liability. When you get into what's retention next quarter, what happens in new business exporter, we're confident that all of those things will work in the same direction. As it relates to expenses, we think we need to continue. I mean we wanted to affordable simple, connected protection. Affordable means low price. That means we're going to continue to reduce costs. And so we've got a whole bunch of things we're working on now that are -- we've been working on for a couple of years as you point out, that are starting to generate benefits. But we have more to go. Like we don't -- we think there's with the age of digitization and the things we can do in our business, we can still drive cost on. As it relates to advertising, the reason we broke that out separately is that, that does relate to the fact of we don't want people to be to miscommunicate to people that we think taking advertising down and making that lower is a good idea, because we think growth creates value for shareholders as long we're operating at attractive returns. We've got a good set of capabilities there. And I'd be happy to talk about that. If anybody wants to get there, but we're comfortable that we can continue to invest in growth, get good returns, lower expenses at the same time, increased market share, which then will lead to a re-rating of the earnings multiple. Gregory Peters : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your question please. Jimmy Bhullar : Hi. Good morning. I just had a question on, what you're seeing in terms of competitive trends in the Personal Auto market, both in terms of pricing and advertising. It seems like margins for most of the companies are getting closer to normal. So wondering if that, if you're starting to see some of them, get aggressive on price? I know certainly advertising spending has been going up a lot. But what are you seeing out there? Tom Wilson : Let me talk about advertising and Mario, can jump in on pricing. And of course, there's a lot of competitors, but let's focus on the biggest competitors for time being a business is the ones that are mostly in play here. So from a -- as we were just talking about, growth is good for shareholders. It's good, because we're earning good returns. Secondly, we're leveraging capabilities over a broader capital base, which drives more shareholder value creation, and then that should lead to a re-rating other multiple. And then you say, what needs to be true for you to do good advertising and to head into a fight on that one. And first, you got to have a product that's differentiated and appeals to customers. So we have that with our new ASC Auto product. We know it from the close to quote ratios higher with product you've got to have -- you got to be getting attractive returns when we talked about that at length. You got to have a great brand because that increases consideration like if people view the first time people have heard of you your dollar advertisings done is effective, obviously, we a great brand and great consideration. You have to have broad access, and this, ties together with transforming growth. We advertise, you can go to exclusive agent, you can go on our website, you can go to a direct. So you want to make sure that however they want to come to, they had advertising dollars effectively used. Now I would say advertising today, though, is a game of precision, much as Auto Insurance pricing went through this great push on sophistication, those who are good at sophistication win. And you can see that when you look at the combined ratios of people like Allstate Progressive, Geico, we all have really good combined ratios, because we're sophisticated in how we price product. Same thing is true in advertising today. So you have to be good at search. And we don't just listen to ourselves. We had external reviews, and we're really good at search. You have to be good at a bidding strategy. How much you're bidding for Elite? We're good at bidding for Elite. It's not like we're perfect. We got other stuff we need to do. You got figure out how you're using different kind of messaging for different groups. And you can imagine with the refrain of number of media channels, number of messages you can do now, particularly with AI, the number of segments you have, your pricing sophistication, it gets complicated really fast. And we're really good at it. So when we go into this, and we're thinking about us increasing the advertising versus other people, you're like, well, how good are you? And we think we're good at it. If you look at where we are with Arity and our Telematics work, that's to really end run around having more information on who you bid on because we track 15% of the U.S. population they're driving. So we can decide how good a driver you are without even sticking a device on you or an app on your phone or a device in your car. So will competition increase in advertising, probably. Do I -- it will be from those carriers who have the same kind of capabilities we do. So we're fully up to winning that game. I think there will be some other people who hold back or even drop out because they can't -- they don't have the capabilities and expertise to do it. So that's where we are in the advertising, good for shareholders because it's good for growth. And we use the money effectively. Mario, do you want talk about pricing environment? Mario Rizzo : Yes. And Jimmy, thanks for the question. I'll answer the question broadly, but I'd put a caveat around it that, obviously, what I'm going to say is going to vary by company and it's going to vary geographically because the business has just operated that way, and there's a lot of competitors in the market. But I would say, by and large, as we discussed this morning and as many of our competitors have reported profitability in auto is improving as loss cost trends have improved. And all of the things being equal, when that happens and margins are better. There's just less rate activity in the system, and that's what we're saying -- companies generally taking less rate than they were over the last couple of years. Again, that will vary by company. Some started later than others and are still catching up. Others are a little further along. But generally, we see less rate getting pushed through. And then certainly, that varies geographically as well. Having said that, I would just take that along with what Tom talked about in terms of advertising and say that when you take the totality of where we're positioned and what we're building with transformative Growth, we like where we're positioned in our ability to be able to increase growth investments and be successful in a competitive marketplace. That's what we're building, and we like our chances. Jimmy Bhullar : And then just on the benefit sale, we're late in the year, and there hasn't been an announcement, but maybe talk a little bit about how the process is going. And I'm assuming it's probably not going to close this year, but are you still assuming the close within the next few months, even if it drags on to next year? Jess Merten : Hi, Jimmy, it's Jess. First, I guess I would start by reminding everyone, the third great businesses. You saw it in the results that I covered. So we're really happy to continue to focus on execution in the operations. It might be helpful if I give you a little bit of a window into the process to help you understand of where we're at and where we're going. So if you think about our process, we started out with a preference for single transaction. But in the same note, we were unwilling to compromise value for that preference, right? So we spent a lot of time with a single transaction buyer that thought they could, in the end, change the terms and/or that we didn't have better options, quite frankly. So we spent a lot of time on a process there, and ultimately, what we decided was to work with other buyers. And that has created a delay in things, it just has. But we're confident that by making that switch, we'll get a better outcome. A better outcome for our shareholders, a better outcome for the businesses. So what I would say right now, and I don't want to get into timing of announcements to close, what I would say is that we're likely to be in a position to announce transactions this year, and you'll get more details about the what and the how, when those announcements come. But that's just a little bit of window into the process and why you still haven't heard anything, if that's helpful. Jimmy Bhullar : And do you intend to sell a disposal of the entire unit eventually, even if it goes into pieces? Or are there some pieces you might decide to retain? Jess Merte : We still intend to make the divestiture of the Health and Benefits segment. Jimmy Bhullar : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bob Huang from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Bob Huang : Hi. Good morning. Maybe one on homeowner. I think last year, when it comes to cat losses, severe convective storm was a one in 2018 event, if I remember correctly, which obviously was a headwind to your cat numbers. Just given how things are developing so far, curious how is it tracking this year? Is it going to be more of a worse than one in 2018 event? Just pace on what we have in the first half, curious in terms of like how are the weathers are developing for the Homeowner side. Tom Wilson : Bob, it's Tom. Thanks for the question on Homeowners. I would look at Homeowners on a longer-term basis than one year. So if you look over the last 11 years, we've made three-quarter of the profit that whole industry has made because we have a pretty sophisticated business model, we've talked about before and be happy to go into, but we're good at homeowners. It's currently turning into a, I guess, what we do domestically, we called the hard market, but a lot of people are bailing on growth in that market because they were either part of the 25% or they were part of the negative amount that led to us every three quarters. So that entire profit pool when we have less than 10% of the total business. So we think that is a great growth opportunity. As it relates to this year, too hard to predict whether. It comes and goes. For the first six months, we made money on an underwriting basis. That makes me feel better than last year, where we didn't make money for the whole year, prior 10 years. We've made money in each of those 10 years. So I feel good about our business model. As it relates to any individual quarter, they're keeping for us is be there for our customers. Like when I got a problem and we're good at getting there fast. We want to be there to take care of their claims. They tell their friends. Our Homeowners as you saw the unit growth is up. It's particularly -- we're doing extremely well in our Allstate agents with bundling customers. So other people are interested in that segment. We're just killing it right now on cross line sales. So we feel good about that. Some of that is the hard market. Some of it's great relationships. Some of it is the product and the pricing we have it all kind of comes together. So we like the business. We think it's got good long-term growth potential. And we -- on a quarterly basis, I wouldn't get too focused on whether it's up or down this second quarter is -- you can decide it's either higher or lower depending on which period of time you wanted to evaluate it against. And so I would just say focus on the long-term results from it. Bob Huang : Okay. Thanks. My second question, a little bit of a shot in the dark here. For the DOJ lawsuit for National General, there has been precedent where under FIRREA Civil Enforcement Actions, where SEC can potentially get involved under the current litigation environment, do you expect that the National General case should get SEC involved at some point down the road? I'm not sure if that's the question you can answer at this point. Tom Wilson : Well, we don't give a lot of specifics on active litigation, obviously. And I certainly can't speak for what other people want to do when we have -- I don't know what the SEC will or will not choose to do. What I can give us a little bit of information. This is -- the lawsuit is in reference to a lender-placed insurance program, so that stuff sold through agents. It's focused on auto insurance. Our program was transparent. We borrowers are treated fairly. And we're confident that we will prevail in this and at the lawsuits will have no impact on our ongoing business. Bob Huang : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski from BMO. Your question, please. Jack Matten : Hi. Good morning. This is Jack on for Mike. Just a follow-up on the advertising spend strategy. I'm curious how your strategy and focus today compares to the last cycle? And more specifically, how much of your ad spend has historically been geared toward direct-to-consumer targeted sales versus supporting your agents? And then how is that evolving today given the success of your transformative growth strategy in your lower expense base? Tom Wilson : Jack, I would say that the third component of transformative growth was increase the sophistication and investment in new customer acquisition. We didn't talk about it here much, but we've gotten much more sophisticated versus the last time we did this. But I think other people have too. So I'm not -- like I don't want conclude we're 5 miles ahead of everybody else but we're good. And so we feel much better about our sophistication. The way in which we go through the allocation of investment is think about it as upper and lower funnel, upper funnel being get the brand out there, do some TV advertisements to make sure people are considering you when they're getting insurance. So you'll notice that more advertising on TV. Then there's what we call lower funnel, which is you're on the website, you're cruising around for a new car, and we pop something into your web browsing that says, hey, what about Allstate or we use addressable TV to do it. So there's lots of different ways we try to do, what I would call, lower funnel. And the first one, you do because we are off a little bit for the last couple of years in terms of down in advertising, we've increased our upper funnel some just because we want people to remember there, got a great brand because we've been investing in it forever. It's got great unaided recognition, and we want to keep investing in that. The biggest portion of our increase would be in the lower funnel piece. That gets tightly tied to what Mario described, which is really by state by market, by risk class, and it's highly sophisticated in terms of how we do that. As it relates to both of those upper and lower funnel work for both all of our -- all of the Allstate brand channels, so agents and direct. Our agents also do some of their own lead generation, whether they go to mortgage brokers or other people in their local areas and buy leads. I think there is an area where we need to bring increased sophistication to it because we're just better at doing it globally than you would be if you live it to Boeing or something like that. So there's increased sophistication there. But think of it as a large machine has got a number of different levers we can pull, and we have -- it has got good gauges on it, so we can tell what's coming out on the other end. And so we're constantly turning and dialing those levers and watching the gauges so that we beat our current competition. Jack Matten : That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe switching gears to auto loss cost trends. If you look at the average underlying loss you disclosed, it's now running slightly lower compared to 2023. I guess does that mean you're now seeing frequency benefits more than offsetting higher severity. And I'm curious how you view the sustainability of current favorable frequency trends. I know last quarter, you mentioned favorable weather. Just curious how those pieces are moving. Tom Wilson : Jack, I'll let Mario jump into both frequency and severity and by coverage. I can just say it's nice to have it be about halfway through the call on loss costs and be talking about growth, which is much more optimistic. A year ago that would have been in the first, second and third question. So it's a good question. Mario will go to it, but I'm happy we're talking about growth because we think that's where we're going to create a lot of shareholder value. So Mario over to you. Mario Rizzo : Sure. Thanks, Jack. I guess the place I'd start is as much as we dig into the components of profitability. They're all important, but we should lose sight of the fact that the way we manage the auto business is to generate mid-90s combined ratios across the entirety of the system. And we use levers like rates and we look at pure premium, whether that's frequency and severity and expenses, they all matter. And certainly, the loss trend helps inform what we need to do with some of the other levers. What I would say, as I mentioned, the negative trend, the negative 0.8% that you see in the supplement as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there's a little bit of noise in in there terms of year-over-year comparisons because we were moving severity targets around intra-quarter last year. So the adjusted numbers, it's slightly positive, it's about 1%. So not all that different. But I would say it's -- favorable frequency has continued through the first half of the year has been offset by higher severity predominantly in bodily injury, which continues to run above inflation and on the physical damage side, we continue see some good tailwinds with things like used car prices and stabilizing repair costs and so on. But that's kind of the overall loss trend that we're reacting to. In terms of the sustainability of frequency, it's a really difficult question to answer. Things like weather and geography risk segments all come into play. Frequency has been better than it was a year ago. When we look at our telematics data, which gives us a lot of rich information, miles driven per operators up a little bit but trips are shorter. So that could be having an impact on frequency. Weather favorably impacted frequency in the first quarter. And the other thing I'd say is as we've been looking to improve profitability over the last couple of years and not growing, the risk segmentation and the mix of our auto book has shifted around a bit to higher lifetime value, let lower frequency type business, that's having an impact as well. So there's a lot of moving parts in there. One thing I will say is as we go forward and write more new business, that will impact prospective frequency trends, but I'll go back to where I started. We manage the system in its entirety to generate mid-90s combined ratio profitability, and we're going to continue to do that despite however frequency bounces around. Jack Matten : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Your question please. Yaron Kinar : Thank you, good morning. I wanted to go back to growth or continue to focus on growth. I think ever since the Transformative Growth program was announced and launched. Clearly, you've had some issues with COVID and the aftermath of COVID. But now that we're hopefully starting to come out of that transitionary period and all the levers from Transformative Growth are kind of kicking in. Can you maybe help us think through -- I'm not even asking about a one or two-year horizon, but maybe over the cycle, what you think reasonable growth expectations should be on a PIF basis for Allstate. And I say this also in the context of I think we see some of industry leaders in growth, achieving pretty consistent, call it, high -- mid-to-high single-digit growth in PIF. Do you think that you can be at that level? Tom Wilson : So we haven't given out a target for PIF growth, but it's the right way to think about it. Because when you're looking at market share, a lot of times, market share is done in the industry by premiums. Also charge, more have fewer customers and presumably could increase your market share on that basis, that's not our goal. Our goal is PIF growth. If you want to assume that, if you said okay, the U.S. economy in terms of number of cars, house and stuff like that, it's going to be a low single-digit increase, I don't know. So 1% there's not going to be a whole bunch of more new cars in houses in the United States. And so obviously, PIF growth has got to be higher than that. And it is higher than that you can see right now in Homeowners because we're winning in that business. When you look at how far up is up, we don't have a limit on that, if you look at National General, which is one of the reasons we called it out, it's got every bit as good a growth as some of those our competitors who get much higher valuations than we do. And it's got really good profitability. So we know how to do it. And the question is how do you translate it into? And what is the timing? We think there's great growth potential here. And that when you put on, just call it, -- if you take 1% for the overall growth in assets in the United States. You put on top of that what would be modest increases in premiums then you should get revenue growth which is above 5%. And so what does that turn into? You can do the math as well as we can. But we think there's great potential here. When you look at other people, we don't think they figured out how to turn lead into gold. They're just really good at what they do. We think we can be every bit, as good in the Allstate brand and growing that business. Particularly now that we've gotten direct, what I would say is improved and unleashed that. And you can see that from Mario's charts on how much new business we're writing there. So we think there's lots of potential, like we're very optimistic, but we don't have -- here's our magic number that we're going to get to. But whatever the number is, it would lead a higher valuation of earnings than we currently have. Yaron Kinar : Same question. Does the company have reps and warranties insurance associated with the NatGen acquisition that's still in effect? Tom Wilson : If you're relating to the DOJ lawsuit, I don't think that will impact what eventually happens. But let me just reiterate, we're really confident in where we are with that claim, we put it that way. Yaron Kinar : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Your question please. David Motemaden : Hi thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could just talk about within the auto underlying loss ratio. If there's any way to size if there was any one time or unsustainable benefit from frequency in there, one of your peers had called out, I think it was a 2.5 point benefit from unsustainable factors the quarter. I wonder if you could give us any insight in terms of, if any, of the improvement was driven by something that is unsustainable within the auto business? Tom Wilson : No. Let me give you a little -- I'll give you the summary and then go through Mario you can jump in here front. I don't know how you determine what's sustainable or not sustainable in frequency. Examples, if it -- in the winter, if it snows at 3 p.m., and it's kind of wet and then the temperature drops quickly and it turns the ice by time you get to 5 :30 rush hour, a bunch of cars getting accidents. If it snows at 2 a.m., it doesn't matter so much. So I'm not really sure how you -- and that's just one example of the myriad of things that Mario talked about how far are you driving? How often do you drive? How fast you drive? What city driving? Who else drives? Like I don't know how you -- I don't know if they -- I don't know who it was on that remember said that, but I'm not sure how we would be able to with our math and the precision that we were being able to determine what's sustainable or unsustainable. What I would come back to is what Mario said, we price on what it is. So what it is, is what we factor in. Just the frequency goes down in a quarter, we don't suddenly decrease rates. Just like if it goes up in a quarter, we don't suddenly increase rates. We price to get a mid-90s combined ratio in auto insurance, and that's what we'll keep doing. David Motemaden : Got it. That's helpful. Understood. It is pretty complex to do that. So that's fair. My follow-up question is just on the ad spend? And just I think in the past, you've shown -- I think it was the states that are under a 96 combined. I guess, I'm assuming that clearly went up this quarter. And I guess I'm wondering, are there any states where you're holding back on ad spend? And if so, could you just size how big those are as a percentage of the total book? Tom Wilson : I'll let Mario answer the percentage question. I would say in hold back -- I was trying -- think of it as a lever that dialed you turned. Some states were wide open and testing really high levels. Other states were at what we think is appropriate there. So we're constantly managing and testing learning in a live market on how much we bid on stuff. I mean there's just -- it's very sophisticated. So it's not like there's a go or no go level. But there is, to your point, important from a macro standpoint, like how many states you're making money. Mario Rizzo : Yes. And David, what I'd say -- I'd go back to what I said earlier, as we look at that kind of same mix of states, about two-thirds in terms of premium volume of states are at or below our target combined ratio. And I'd say about another 10% or so are on the path to getting there with rate that we've already approved. I guess there's a handful of states that that we're not leaning in, and that's true beyond just the advertising spend, but it would be around things like underwriting guidelines and so on. As much as we've talked about California, New York, New Jersey. California, we got approval for a 30% rate. We are writing new business across all channels in California. As a matter of fact, we filed an additional 6.9% rate to stay ahead of the loss trend because you don't want to get behind in California. But we are now writing in California, and we're spending some marketing dollars there. The two that on the other side of the country, New York and New Jersey are ones that we're still effectively managing what we write. And we're writing very low volumes of business. Having said that, we've gotten rate approvals in New York. We're in active conversations with the department on a 24% rate that we filed that we hope to get resolution on hopefully reasonably soon. And then we'll revisit that stance. And in New Jersey, we got rate approved at the end of last year. We just implemented another low teens rate in July, and we've got another one coming in December. And as we evaluate where that positions us we'll reassess our risk appetite and how much we want to invest. And I'll go back to saying what I've said multiple times is our objective function is to be able to write in every state. But the reality is we need to see a path to attractive returns and profitability to be able to do that once we get there, then we'll expand our appetite across geographies. Tom Wilson : I would just add a couple of things. First, I don't think we'll ever be at 100%. But I also that that the high-growth competitors that your competitor, I guess, you're comparing us to, it probably has the same situation. Like not everything goes well in every state in this business. So I can see what people are trying to do. You're trying to triangulate between the gap of a small decrease in auto insurance to what's the increase is going to be and how does that translate into the increase in valuation multiple. Appropriate thing, we're focused on it as well. I would just say that the gap between the current growth and what potential is probably narrower than the gap that between the valuation, like our valuation multiple could be substantially higher even with small moves in the growth rate. You have to decide what you think that's worth and whether you want to pay for it or not. But I think that focusing -- it's not going to be a one-to-one thing, and it's not all going to happen at the same time. But we're confident we can grow like we know how to run this business. David Motemaden : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vikram Gandhi from HSBC. Your question, please. Vikram, you might have your phone on mute. We're still not hearing you. Would you like me to\u2026 Tom Wilson : Why don't we go to the next question? Operator : All right. Our question then comes from the line of Charles Lederer from Citi. Your question please. Charles Lederer : Hi, can you talk about the new issued app mix on Slide 8, I guess how does your customer appetite differ across channels as you open things back up? And how do you see that impacting your margins given direct tends to have a higher upfront expense ratio as I understand it? Tom Wilson : First, I would say we want all customers all locations or most locations, but all risk levels. Mario, do you want to talk about maybe specialist, not general or non-standard. Mario Rizzo : Yes, Charlie, I'd say from a channel perspective, like in the Allstate brand, we have differentiated pricing between agency and direct. So we have we have the ability to do that to match the cost of doing business in the channel with the price that we charge. In terms of underwriting risk appetite, we write in standard and preferred across the entirety of the risk segment. And if we have the right price in the agent channel, we're right in the agent channel, and we'll also write it indirect. So there's very few exceptions in terms of different underwriting standards across channels. In terms of brands, the one risk segment that I think is new in the sense of we acquired it when we acquired National General is the nonstandard auto business, which historically Allstate really didn't participate in, in a meaningful way. That's a very well-run business. That's the lion's share currently of the nonstandard auto premium, generating really strong growth unit growth just under 12% with really strong profitability. And the one thing I'd say on that segment of business, there tend to be a lot of shoppers in that segment. So you can turn growth on and off a lot more rapidly. You tend to be able to reprice the book pretty quickly because the retention is lower. And I think that's become a real growth lever for us. As you can see in our numbers, we've been able to grow that business grow it profitably because we now have the right capabilities to write in that segment, which we didn't have when we started transformative growth. So but we're -- as Tom mentioned, we're positioned to write across channels, across brand and equally importantly, risk segments through National General in nonstandard Auto. But now, as I've talked about, Custom360 and rolling out middle market standard preferred and homeowner product, we can go upmarket in the independent agent channel as well. But we're positioned to write across the entirety of system. Tom Wilson : Okay. Thank you all for spending your time with us as we move forward, we'll keep doing what do well, which is to serve our customers. We're going work on accelerating our growth in the profit liability business, making sure we're proactively investing and we didn't have spent a lot of time on that today, but we've had really great results in our investment portfolio. And then expanding protection offerings through great platforms like Protection Plans. Thank you all. We'll see you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

After the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, please be aware this call is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Alastair Gobin, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Alastair Gobin : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to Allstate's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, filed our 10-Q and posted related material on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team will provide perspective on our strategy and an update on our results. After prepared remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures, for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2023 and other public documents for information on potential risks. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Good morning. We appreciate you investing your time in understanding the value creation potential at Allstate. I'm going to provide an overview of results. Mario and Jess will walk through the operating performance, and then we'll address your questions. So let's begin on Slide 2. Allstate's strategy has two components, increased personal Property-Liability market share, and expand protection provided to customers, which are shown in the two ovals on the left. We now have more than 200 million policies in force. On the right hand side, you can see Allstate's performance for the third quarter. Total revenues of $16.6 billion were up 14.7%, compared to the prior year quarter. Allstate generated net income of $1.2 billion and adjusted net income of $3.91 per share. Return on equity was 26.1% over the last 12 months. The Property-Liability business, is now positioned for growth. Execution of the auto profit improvement plan has restored auto margins, near term auto insurance policy growth will require us to improve customer retention and increase new business levels, both of which Mario will discuss. The homeowners business had good returns and is growing. The transformative growth initiatives, to build a low cost digital insurer with affordable, simple and connected protection, will ensure that this growth is sustainable. Proactive investing also benefited income as the decision to lengthen duration at the right time increased portfolio yields. In addition, higher insurance prices, and increased reserve levels create a much larger investment portfolio, which also raises income. Protection plans continues to profitably grow, and we recently did a small acquisition to expand mobile device protection capabilities. Let's move to Slide 3. Here you can see the operational execution generated excellent financial results. Revenues increased to $16.6 billion. As you can see in the upper left, Property-Liability earned premiums were up 11.6%. Net investment income for the quarter was $783 million that's 13.6% higher than the prior year quarter. Net income was $1.16 billion. Adjusted net income as I mentioned was $3.91 per share. And then, you can see in the lower right that the return on equity was 26.1%. This shows that Allstate's operational excellence enabled us to dramatically improve results from last year. Now let's hear from Mario on Property-Liability results. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Tom. Before I go into my remarks on the quarter, I want to call out a change we made to our disclosures. You'll notice that we simplified our Protection segment disclosures this quarter, to focus on product and channel instead of brand. For the past several years, we've provided detail on both the Allstate and National General brands separately, to create transparency into National General's performance and allow you to evaluate the acquisition. National General has been a highly successful acquisition, since it is now twice its size, generates excellent returns and gives us strong competitive positions in both independent agent distribution and non-standard auto risk. We're now building on this success by combining operations, such as expanding the sale of non-standard business under the Allstate brand. As a result, performance should be evaluated for the protection business in total, and by distribution channel versus by brand and that's why we made the change. So in keeping with this approach, my commentary today will be focused on performance on total auto and homeowner lines, and production by distribution channel. With that as background, let's start on Slide 4. On the top of the table on the left, you can see Property-Liability premiums of $13.7 billion, increased 11.6% in the third quarter driven by higher average premiums. Underwriting income of $495 million improved by $909 million, compared to the prior year quarter, as improved underlying margins more than offset higher catastrophes. The expense ratio of 21.5 was 0.3 points higher than prior year, due to increased advertising. As we continue to accelerate growth investments in rate adequate states and risk segments. The chart on the right depicts the components of the 96.4 combined ratio. The loss ratio shown in light blue includes losses of $1.7 billion and was 2.8 points higher than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 83.2 in dark blue improved by 8.7 points, compared to the prior year quarter. The improvement was driven by higher average earned premium, and improved loss cost strengths. Prior year reserve reestimates excluding catastrophes had only a minor impact on current quarter results, as favorable development in personal auto and homeowners insurance, was more than offset by increases in personal umbrella and runoff business, primarily related to asbestos related claims, which was recorded this quarter, as a result of our annual third quarter discontinued lines reserve review. Now let's dive deeper into auto insurance margins on Slide 5, where you can see the success of the auto profit improvement plan. The third quarter recorded auto insurance combined ratio of 94.8 improved by 7.3 points, compared to the prior year quarter as average earned premiums outpaced loss costs. Average underlying loss in expense was 4.8% above prior year quarter, reflecting higher current year incurred severity estimates, primarily driven by bodily injury coverage offset by lower accident frequency, as well as higher advertising investments to drive new business growth. Physical damage severity increases continue to moderate, while bodily injury severity continues to trend above broader inflation indices. Our claims team continues to focus on operational actions, to mitigate the impact of inflationary trends. As a reminder, we regularly review claim severity expectations throughout the year. If the expected severity for the current year changes, we record the year-to-date impact in the current quarter, even though a portion of that impact is attributable to previous quarters. For 2022 and 2023, the bars in the graph reflect the updated average severity estimates, as of the end of each of those years to remove the volatility, related to intra-year severity adjustments. Similarly, in the third quarter of 2024, the full year claim severity estimate went down, so there was a benefit from prior quarters included in the third quarter's reported results. This benefit was worth 0.8 points in the third quarter, with the adjusted quarterly combined ratio of 95.6 as shown on the far right bar. Now let's review homeowners insurance on Slide 6, which generates attractive returns and growth opportunities. Allstate is an industry leader in homeowners insurance, generating a low 90s combined ratio over the last 10 years. As you can see in the chart on the left, this performance compares favorably to the industry, which experienced an underwriting loss and a combined ratio of 103 over the same time period. Moving to the table on the right, Allstate Protection homeowners written premium increased by 10.8%, compared to prior year reflecting higher average gross written premium per policy, and policy enforced growth of 2.5%. The third quarter combined ratio of 98.2 resulted in $60 million of underwriting income, compared to a $131 million loss in the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 62.1 improved by 10.8 points, due to higher average premium and lower non-catastrophe loss costs. For the first nine months of 2024, homeowners insurance generated an underwriting profit of $249 million, despite $1.2 billion of catastrophe losses in in the third quarter. Let me provide insight into the growth potential of the Property-Liability business starting on Slide 7. In the chart on the left, you see the composition of the Property-Liability book. Homeowners in medium blue represents approximately 20% of policies in force. Homeowners' insurance policies in force increased by 2.5% as retention has improved by close to half a point, compared to last year and new issued applications are close to 20% above prior year. As you can see in the right hand column. We view homeowners as a growth opportunity. Auto policies in the dark blue account for approximately two-thirds of Property-Liability policies enforced. As you can see on the right side of the page, overall policies enforce declined by 1.5%. This reflects a decline in customer retention to 84.7%, which is 2/10th of a point below the prior year quarter, but much lower than historical levels. We did have a 26% increase in new issued applications, which offset some of the retention losses. Now let's go through each of these components to give you insight into how to assess growth prospects. Let's start with customer retention on Slide 8. This chart shows Allstate brand auto insurance retention over a 10-year period which is primarily standard auto insurance risks. There is a couple of key points I want to make on this slide. First, raising prices leads to lower retentions as customers shop for other options. Second, the large increases in the last several years have led to a significant decline in retention since 2022, which has negatively impacted policies in force. This has, however, recently leveled off as price increases have moderated. Let's look at the three periods with the arrows. In 2015 and 2016, we raised auto insurance prices, which you can see from the dotted line because of an increase in the frequency of accidents. The graph shows how this led to lag declines in retention from 88.2 in 2014 to 86.7 in 2017. Over the next three years, price increases were relatively modest and retention recovered reaching 88.3 by 2019. Now, there are lots of factors impacting retention, such as the amount of new business you write, the risk type of that business, number of bundled policies and specific actions taken in big states like California and Florida, as well as customer satisfaction levels. But the biggest driver is price. Increased advertising and price competition had a modest negative impact over the next several years with retention hovering around 87%. You can see this in the most recent period where retention has declined by 2.7 points over the last 10 quarters, which reflected rate increases of 36% on a cumulative basis. Looking forward, we expect lower rate increases given the profitability of auto insurance. This year, for example, Allstate brand rates have been increased by 6.3% compared to 9.5% in the first nine months of last year. Lower price increases should translate into higher retention. To help you model this out, every point of retention is worth approximately 350,000 policies enforced each and every year, or 1.4% of the current policy count. Moving to Slide 9, let's discuss the success we've had in increasing new business levels this year. We continue to invest in transformative growth while we executed the profit improvement plan. These foundational investments enable us to go to market with a multichannel distribution strategy that serves customers based on their personal preferences and has resulted in a 26% increase in new business in the third quarter shown in the far right column at the bottom. While profit actions previously restricted our new business appetite, rate adequacy has now been achieved in the vast majority of states. Third quarter advertising spend was roughly 60% higher than the same quarter in 2021. In the Allstate agency channel, the compensation structure was also changed to improve growth and agent productivity at lower distribution costs. Allstate Agency new business was up 16% over the prior year quarter with bundling rates at point of sale at all-time highs. The national general acquisition enabled us to grow independent agency new business by 14% over the prior year quarter. In the direct channel, we are back to 2022 levels with fewer underwriting restrictions, increased advertising and the new affordable, simple and connected auto product which is currently available in 25 states. New business is 56% over prior year and we expect to increase to continue increasing volume in this channel which now represents 31% of total auto new business. This level of new business will drive future growth. Every 5% increase in new issued applications above the current run rate increases policies enforce by approximately 250,000 items or 1% of policies in force. Looking forward, the property liabilities business is positioned for growth. Margins are attractive, fewer rate increases should improve retention and the components of transformative growth are working, including new products, increased advertising, lower expenses and expanded distribution. This will enable us to achieve our strategic goal of increased Property-Liability market share. And now, I'll turn it over to Jess. Jess Merten : Thank you, Mario. Let's shift to Slide 10 to review investment performance. A proactive approach to portfolio management that optimizes return per unit of risk across the enterprise generated strong returns this quarter. Our disciplined approach includes comprehensive monitoring of economic conditions, market opportunities, interest rates and credit spreads. The chart on the left shows the fixed income, portfolio yield and assets under management trend over the last several years. Fixed income yield shown with the orange line has steadily increased as we repositioned into higher yielding longer duration assets. Based on interest rates in the third quarter our fixed income yield is now generally in line with market yields. In the gray bars you can see growth in the portfolio book value. Since the fourth quarter of 2021, book value has increased by 14% or $9.1 billion, reflecting the impact of higher underwriting cash flows attributable to increased premiums and reserve levels as well as portfolio cash flows that increased because of higher coupon rates. Growth in assets and higher yields benefited net investment income as shown in the chart on the right. Net Investment income totaled $783 million in the quarter, which is $94 million above the third quarter of last year. Market based income of $708 million, which is shown in blue, was $141 million above the prior year quarter, reflecting the impact of a fixed income yield that is 60 basis points above the third quarter last year. Performance based income of $143 million shown in black was $43 million below the prior year quarter, reflecting lower real estate investment results. While this quarter's result is lower than our long term expectation, our returns continue to be strong and volatility on these assets from quarter-to-quarter is expected. Slide 11 highlights strong results in the protection plans business, which is one of the five companies in the protection services segment that also includes Arity, Roadside, dealer Services and identity protection. The Protection Plans business provides warranties for consumer electronics, computers and tablets, TVs, mobile phones, major appliances and furniture through strong domestic and international retail distribution relationships. Revenues for this business totaled $512 million in the third quarter and increased 23.1% compared to the prior year, reflecting growth in international markets. Profitable growth resulted in adjusted net income of $39 million, a $19 million increase compared to the prior year quarter, as strong operational execution increased margins and enabled successful implementation of the strategy to expand distribution relationships and product offerings. We continue to invest in this fast growing business. In October, Allstate Protection Plans acquired Kingfisher to enhance capabilities in mobile phone protection. Now let's Transition to Slide 12 to focus on the terms and accounting treatment of the sale of the Employer Voluntary Benefits business. As we announced in August, Allstate finalized an agreement to sell the Employer Voluntary Benefits business, which I will also refer to as the EVB business for a purchase price of $2 billion to StanCorp Financial. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, pending regulatory approvals. As a reminder, the EVB sale is the first step in a strategic decision to pursue divestiture of the Employer Voluntary Benefits, group health and individual health businesses to capture value through greater strategic alignment. The EVB transaction is economically and financially attractive for shareholders. Allstate retains the economics of the business until closing and results continue to be reflected in net income and adjusted net income. In the quarter $3.2 billion of assets and $2.2 billion of liabilities related to the EVB business have been classified as held for sale. As you can see on the right of the slide, we're estimating a $600 million gain and had previously disclosed that we expect the transaction to generate approximately $1.6 billion of capital. Moving to health and benefits results for the quarter, Premium and contract charges for the segment increased 5.2% for $24 million compared to the prior year quarter. The individual and group health businesses saw strong growth with premiums and contract charges up by 8.1% and 20.2% respectively. This growth was partially offset by a modest decrease in the EVB business. Adjusted net income for the segment of $37 million in the quarter was $32 million lower than the prior year quarter as increased benefit utilization across all three businesses impacted profitability, underwriting and rate actions are being taken to quickly address the benefit ratio trends and restore margins to historical levels. The process to evaluate disposition of the group and individual businesses is progressing. Let's wrap up with Slide 13 to recap Allstate's strategy and path to value creation. Operational excellence ensures that we react to changing business conditions and maintain margins at target levels. Transformative growth investments are being made to create sustainable growth and Allstate delivers attractive returns. With that as context, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Certainly. And our first question for today comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your question, please. Jimmy Bhullar : Hi, good morning. So first, just had a question around your confidence and outlook for PIF growth in the auto business, and what you're seeing in terms of competitor behavior, both on prices and on advertising. Seems like most competitors are - shifting to a growth mode now that margins have recovered. But are you confident that we can see PIF growth turn positive over the next few quarters? Tom Wilson : Jimmy, let me make a couple of comments and Mario can jump in. First, we don't give growth projections, so we're not going to comment on that. We gave you. We put the numbers in there, so you can do your own analysis of how you think we'll do in retention, and how you think we'll do in new business. We obviously believe we can grow market share, which is what our whole strategy is about. When you look at the competitive environment, you continue to see progressive advertising aggressively GEICO has gotten back into the market, but perhaps not as aggressively as they have in the past. And State Farm continues to try to grow, but as you know, they have an underwriting profitability challenge that they're I suspect they will take out, but we'll only see. But I would also not just focus on those big players, but there's a whole bunch of other players that are more moderate size or smaller that either don't have the firepower in advertising to compete, or don't have the pricing sophistication. Mario, do you want to make comments about how you're feeling about growth? Mario Rizzo : Yes, thanks for the question, Jimmy. At its highest level, obviously to turn positive, PIF growth requires that we keep more of our existing customers, which is the retention component, and then we drive increased levels of new business. Maybe I'll talk about each of the pieces individually. Like we pointed out in the presentation, obviously a lot of the rate actions in the profit improvement plan that we've implemented over the last couple of years has had a pretty negative impact on customer retention. Now going forward, we would expect, just given where our margins are in auto, all other things being equal, we would expect to take less rate going forward, which will have a positive impact on retention, as it has in the past as we create less disruption in the book. But the other side of it is, we're not just going to rely on that. We've got actions in place in a number of areas, both in terms of improving the customer experience. Working with our customers, both through our agents, and our contact centers to help identify opportunities to improve affordability, and really kind of mitigate shopping activity from our own customers. So, we're focused on retention improving going forward, both kind of organically, I'll say through less rate, but we're also not sitting back. We're taking proactive actions to help offset some of the headwind that we've seen in retention. On the other side. On the new business standpoint, just to give you some context, we talked about the vast majority of markets being open for business somewhere between 75% and 80% of our premium volume. When you look at it nationally, those are markets that we are open for business. We're accelerating investments, and we've really seen some good production trends across all distribution channels. Our agents are productive, they're bundling at all-time high levels, which also will help retention. We believe over time we're continuing to see really good traction on the direct business and we think there's ongoing opportunity there. And then as I mentioned earlier, the National General acquisition and what we've been able to do both in the non-standard auto market, as well as in the independent agent space more broadly, is generating some good production trends. So, we feel good about that. We're focused on improving retention, while continuing to build on the growth momentum from a new business perspective, which has improved sequentially over the course of the year. And when those two things come together, that that's what will drive positive growth. Tom Wilson : Jimmy, let me add just a couple of things. On a longer term perspective, what Mario talked about. So when auto profitability went negative, we said first priority, get the rate, don't be too specific about it. And what Mario is talking about is going back in now and saying, okay, well we got the total rate. How many more people should be using Milewise? How many more people should be using telematics? Those are great opportunities for us to leverage our innovation and keep more customers. So there's a bunch of good work going on there. So the priority that we gave to the team was we need to make money in auto insurance. We've done that. Now we're ready to go back in and, which should drive retention. The other thing I would say is on distribution. If you look at our historical growth, this is the first time really we have three fully functioning channels. Like, we've got three horses here, all ready to run. You can see the growth. And direct is up a lot this versus last year. But that's, because direct was the first place we shutdown, too. When it came to how do we get profitability up in auto insurance, we said well, first, if we're losing money on it, we shouldn't write it. Rather than take that hit in volume to the Allstate aging channel, which needs to be maintained in terms of its revenue and growth, we said, let's just do it to direct. So the direct bounce back, is just where we are now. But in that pause, we really built out our capability. So, we're feeling good about having three horses to drive growth. Jimmy Bhullar : Okay. And then on capital, obviously, your balance sheet's a lot stronger with the improved profitability. You've got the pending sale of the benefits business as well. How should we think about uses of capital, as profitability continues to recover and once the sale closes between sort of your priorities for acquisitions, potential buybacks, dividends? Tom Wilson : A very appropriate question. I'll channel Jess for a minute here, and just say, we've always had a lot of capital. So I know not everybody believed that, but we've always been financially very strong. But as we think about capital, it is something we take very seriously. It's really one of the key things we do for shareholders, and we feel like we've been good stewards of that. As you look forward, we think the best and first place to put our money, is organic growth. Particularly when you look at the kind of ROEs we're running at. And if you look at our growth in premiums, you look at the growth potential, we think that will be the first and best place to maximize shareholder value. There's lots of other ways we use it, right. So share repurchases. I know a number of analysts brought that question up. Let me just go right to that. So we're no stranger to share repurchases. Since we went public, we bought back 83% of our shares outstanding for about $42 billion. Last 10 years, it was $20 billion in the last five years it was about $10 billion and a quarter of the shares outstanding. So we know how to and do share repurchases, when it makes sense. In this particular case, we think the growth opportunities outweigh the value of doing share repurchases. And that's because the returns are so high on that. Now if we don't, if you're keeping extra money around and you put it in the bond portfolio, and you're getting 5%, then obviously you should not be doing it. We do have other places we've used the money historically, and places we might use it in the future. So as we dialed down our equity allocation back when, we didn't think the risk and return was right. If we feel like that's appropriate, we'll dial that equity allocation up again. That uses capital. If we've also looked at acquiring growth. So the National General acquisition, Mario talked about it. And the reason we kept breaking it out so you could all see it, is that business just rocked it's twice its size. And the same thing is true with our protection plans business, which is nine or 10 times its size since we bought. And that was a little longer ago, it was seven years, but we paid $1 billion for it, and it's making over $120 million a year. So, we're feeling really good about that business, and its growth potential. So just know we always have our shareholders best interest in mind. We think about it broadly and we'll continue to do that. Jimmy Bhullar : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your question please. Gregory Peters : Good morning, everyone. I'd like to, for my first question, focus on Slide 8, which is your retention slide. And in your comments you mentioned changing of agent compensation. If I'm not mistaken, some time ago you lowered agent compensation on renewals. And I'm wondering if that's having any spillover effect on retention. Obviously, the new shoe daps are doing strong, so your competitive position looks good. Also, as part of transformative growth, I think you've been streamlining some claims costs, some claims functions. Curious if you're seeing any impact of that on retention? Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Greg. This is Mario. Let me take your questions in order. First, on retention, when we isolate and look at, we look at retention a whole bunch of different ways. When we look at retention in the agency channel, it's actually up year-over-year. So what's happening and what you see on Page 8 is predominantly a function of price increases, which I think have the biggest impact on retention. Just from an agent compensation perspective as you mentioned, we kind of changed and have been transforming the model for them to really align with what both we want to do strategically, but also the value that customers see from agent. So we've incented agents to drive more new business, deepen relationships with customers and we see that with kind of all-time high levels of bundling. And agents, we're really pleased with the performance of our agency force and how productive they are and they're going to be a key part of our growth plan going forward. But that's really not the driver of retention that you see on the page. In terms of the claims organization, that's an area where even though the -- when you look at the ratio, it's pretty flat, that's a function of just having higher average premium. We're investing in claims. We actually have been adding staff so that we can continue to build on our claims capabilities, pay what we owe, drive a higher level of customer satisfaction. And again, we look at those as growth levers every bit as much as profit and severity management levers, but nothing really from a claim standpoint driving the retention numbers. And as I said, as a matter of fact, we're adding resources and dollars in claims to help both support the growth that we want to achieve going forward, but enhance customer satisfaction and effectively continue to manage severity levels. Gregory Peters : Thanks for that additional information. I guess as my follow up question, just looking at the homeowners business, it looks like it's really performing well at a 62.1% underlying combined ratio. You're growing that business. I assume you're not growing just your standalone homeowners business with the policy force growth. It's part of a bundle. But maybe you can provide us some perspective on how you're able to grow that business considering all the rates you've thrown in that line of business? Tom Wilson : I'll start and then Mario can jump in. So first, you're right and Mario called that we're just really good in homeowners. And we've made a lot of money at it. And because we've repositioned the business really over almost a 10-year period, everything from how do we underwrite to what's covered by the policy, to how we price, to our specificity and sophistication and pricing and the way we settle claims. So we're doing quite well there. You see, we are growing. Some of that is, as Mario talked about, our agents are really good at bundling and that leads to better lifetime value for us and cheaper prices for customers. So that's good on both sides. We do think that there's more growth potential there. Some of that is many people, because of the industry numbers that Mario quoted, have now decided not to grow in homeowners. And that gives us more opportunity, not just through the Allstate agents, but in particular through the independent agents. And I think we should be able to crack the code on direct. Nobody's really cracked the code on direct yet in selling homeowners, but I think there's great potential there. So I think there's growth in homeowners across all three channels. Obviously Allstate agents are doing well. The independent agent business, Mario might want to talk about what we're doing with custom 360. And then direct, I think we could be an industry leader. And my logic is, people buy houses off the web. Like if you buy a house off the web, you should buy your homeowners insurance off the web. So we'll have to sort that one out. So we're feeling good about it. I would just -- the other thing I would say is not really yet in market, but coming soon is ASC Affordable Simple Connected Homeowners. Mario has talked about Affordable Simple Connected Auto, which is in market in 25 states. Mario Rizzo : Yes, 25 states now. Tom Wilson : And ASC homeowners is even better. And it's got some really nice features to it, sophistication which will leave us behind in our classic product. And our classic product is far ahead of the industry. So we think it's another leap forward. You want to talk about like 360 or how you view homeowners, maybe by state or something? Mario Rizzo : Yes. So Greg, again I just reiterate where Tom started. We're really good at homeowners and we think there is a real opportunity for us to grow homeowners in part right now because of the disruption that exists in the market. There's just fewer competitors out there that are wanting to write new business and we want to take advantage of that opportunity. We feel good about where our pricing is. As you mentioned, average premiums have gone up pretty consistently at a double digit clip over the last several years to keep pace with inflation. But when you look at our profit trends and you pointed out our underlying combined ratio which is currently in the low 60s, I think that's reflective of our ability to stay on top of loss trends and write new homeowners business at an attractive margin. We target low 90s which generates really strong returns on capital. We think we can do that and grow the business across all the distribution channels. And I'll just end with the opportunity with Custom360 in the independent agent channel because I think that becomes additive to our Allstate agents and our ability to grow direct in the Allstate brand. We're in I believe 24 states with Custom360. Currently, that's a standard and preferred auto offering along with homeowners that leverages Allstate's data and mid-market capabilities to price and really design that product. So it's intended to be the same product that we go to market with in the Allstate brand. As you can imagine, in the independent agent space we're getting really good traction on our ability to lead with homeowners which enables us to not just write the homeowners but also capture the auto opportunity from a packaged perspective. So we feel really good about the go forward opportunity in the independent agent space, which I think from a National General perspective becomes additive to the great success we've had in growing the nonstandard auto business and is really another way that we can leverage our homeowner capabilities broadly across all three horses, I'll use Tom's term, to really grow that business and generate really attractive returns going forward. Tom Wilson : And Greg, let me make sure we fully answer your question. Price sensitivity, you referenced the rate of increase and it is high, it's higher than auto insurance right at this point. Not necessarily over the last three years, but pretty high. But that's -- it's just less price sensitive than auto insurance is. There are a whole bunch of reasons. Some of the people like their house a lot. Second, people know their house is actually worth more and so when we're charging more, they know their house is worth more. Mario Rizzo : Not so much on cars. So, we had to raise auto insurance prices because the houses or the cars became worth. But people didn't really think about it that way. They do think about their home value. So we're comfortable with where we're at. Gregory Peters : Thanks for the additional information. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Your question please. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning. I actually have two on renewal ratios. First, maybe conceptually just looking at the slide eight, as the company grows in nonstandard auto and in direct, two areas where I think, and then correct me if I'm wrong, renewal rates for the industry have tended to be a bit lower. Is it fair to think of a run rate renewal rate that would be a bit lower than the call it through cycle 87.5 or so that I see in the slide? Tom Wilson : Insightful question, Mara, you want to take that? Mario Rizzo : Yes. The first just to be clear, the numbers you see on the page are Allstate brand. So there's just not that much nonstandard auto. There's more direct, but at least currently, again, not a meaningful impact in the trends. On a go forward basis, I guess, I'd broaden the statement a little bit, Yaron and say, the more new business we write, that first renewal period or the first policy period tends to be lower than the book overall. So the more new business volume we write, there will be some downward pressure on the overall retention rate. Current volumes aren't meaningful enough to really drive a significant impact. But you're right from that perspective. And then certainly in the non-standard auto space, we've seen it with National General as we broaden the risk appetite in the Allstate brand and kind of do the opposite of what we're doing in homeowners, take advantage and leverage National General's non-standard auto capabilities in the Allstate brand that will have an impact on retention. Again, magnitude, we'll have to call that out for you when we see it. But certainly that business tends to retain at lower levels because those customers just tend to shop more. So those things will have an impact on retention going forward. But I would say what you see in Page 8, pretty much a muted impact on those items at this point. Yaron Kinar : Great. And then just think about the renewal ratio from here on. I think at times you see a little bit of a breakdown of that inverse correlation between rate increases and the renewal ratio. And we saw a little bit of that a bit earlier in this current cycle. Obviously we're seeing that pick up now. But I guess bottom line, is there a bit of a lag currently between the rate increases and the renewal ratio? One that we -- I don't think we was as pronounced in prior years? Mario Rizzo : Yes. Yaron, it's Mario, again. There is almost certainly a lag when you think about implementing a rate increase in auto. It takes six months for that to be implemented across the entirety of the book and then you'll earn it over the six months after that. So there is a lag in terms of the rate we've taken or the industry takes and the impact on retention. And you see that in our numbers. One of the things though that I point out is and we've been clear on this. We believe we will need to take less rate given where profitability is. But again, this is a state-by-state, market-by-market business. So when we need to take prices up to keep pace with loss trends, we're going to do that. And what you saw in the third quarter, about 70% of the rate that we took was in three states. It was in New York, New Jersey, and an increase we implemented in Texas. So we're going to continue to take rate where we need to. We just think there's going to be less of it. And again, we'll look to manage retention alongside that. Yaron Kinar : But I guess what I'm trying to get at here is I think the big rate increases that we saw in the beginning of the year were really first quarter weighted. California, New York, New Jersey. I would have thought that the full impact of those rates taking effect in the first quarter would have been in the second quarter. And by the time we came out of the third quarter, call it August, September, we'd see a little less of that pressure? Mario Rizzo : Yes, the California rate was in the first quarter. New York and New Jersey were actually implemented in the third quarter. So -- and I believe it was over 18% in New York and 13.7 or 13.4 in New Jersey. So again, there's some pretty meaningful rates that we've implemented currently, again, to get those markets back to where they need to be from a margin perspective so we can open up to right new business. Tom Wilson : So, Yaron, I would just say that the leg is muted and it kind of goes up and goes down, right? Like, not everybody shops, the minute they get the price, it's late, they get the bill, they just pay the bill. Then they decide after a couple of months, geez, I should really think about this. So it's not a simple on renewal that happens. Yaron Kinar : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bob Huang from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Bob Huang : Good morning. My question also kind of follows around that line of business. So if we think about your combined ratio and growth, right. In auto, you typically target a mid-90 combined ratio, understanding that pricing has a lagging effect and then retention and growth also does. But if we just look at the combined ratio, is the current level good enough for you to really step on the gas for growth? Or do you feel you probably need a one or two point more on the auto combined ratio side before you're fully comfortable with fully ramping up that growth going forward? Tom Wilson : We think that the auto profit improvement plan has been successfully completed. That's why we dialed up advertising by 60% from 2021. That's not just up, that's way up over last year. It's like we're not even in the same zip code. So yes, we spend the money and are investing the money because we think it will -- there are good returns. And there's like things happen in every state. So, Bob, sometimes you got a state, sometimes you back off. Mario's team is constantly doing that. But when you just look in total, we're feeling good about it in total. If you look at a couple of states, yeah, there's still some work to do. Bob Huang : Okay. That's super helpful. Thank you for that. Second question is around the homeowner side. Understand that you kind of said there are a few competitors now. The technology really makes it easier potentially for homeowner insurance to really grow from here. But isn't it fair to say that the states where there are opportunities, there are also states where people are trying to pull out. So growth, wouldn't that be geography related? Can you maybe talk about what regions do you think is more attractive on the homeowner front or where do you think the opportunity lies in the growth on that space? Tom Wilson : So let me go up a minute and then turn it over to Mario. First, we think homeowners is a good business. There is the challenge of increased severe weather and what it does to increase catastrophe losses, which you referenced. Like why go right where there's a bunch of catastrophes? I mean if you can get the right price, its fine. And then you just buy reinsurance for a risk you don't want. And when you look at increased losses from weather related events, there are three drivers. One just more storms and more severe -- mostly more severe storms actually. Two is houses are worth more and three people are building houses in places that are risk. To your other point, those latter two you can know, like those are known knowns. You can factor those into your pricing effect. You can factor those into your growth opportunities. You can factor that into where you try to get new customers. It's the third one. But the third one tends to be the -- is the smallest according to a couple of external studies of the dry attribution on increased catastrophe losses. So the unknown known of what will happen to the severity of storms is the smallest driver of the increase in catastrophe losses. So we feel good about it in total from a macro standpoint. And then we execute it obviously at a not even at a much below a state level. You get east of Sunrise Highway, we get different standards and if you're west of Sunrise Highway on Long Island. So Mario, do you want to talk about where you see growth opportunities? Mario Rizzo : Yes. Maybe I'll start with where we don't, because I think it gets to the first part of your question. And two states in particular, Florida and California obviously really challenged homeowner markets that there's been a lot of pullback across the industry. Those are not states that we're looking to get bigger in. So certainly those would not be where we focus our growth efforts and then we'll continue to manage PML and coastal exposure to be within our risk appetite. But then once you kind of get away from that, really the rest of the country, particularly the middle part of the country is -- there's real opportunity for us to continue to grow homeowners. And that's not where you get the hurricanes or necessarily the wildfires. It's more severe weather, tornadoes, hail and so on. And what we found is a lot of competitors have pulled back in those states given severe weather experience. I think that's where our capabilities from a product, a pricing, a risk management perspective really enable us to take advantage of the disruption in the market and grow pretty broadly geographically and not have to kind of grow where, I guess where we can, because nobody else wants it, but actually grow where we think we can generate attractive returns. And that geographically is the vast majority of the country. And again, that's why I think being good at homeowners and having an effective system and operating model to write it and write it profitably is a real competitive advantage for us. And I think you see that in the growth trends really over the course of this year. Tom Wilson : And I just said, we grew 2.5% from the last year, and we did grow in two giant markets that Mario talked about, which I'm going to guess are 15% to 20% of the homes in the United States. So, we did quite well there. Bob Huang : Excellent. Really appreciate the answer. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of [Christian Gitzoff] from Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning, Mario. You said a 75% to 80% of your auto premiums are currently open for new business. So is it safe to assume that auto policies grew quarter-over-quarter in those states in the Q3? Mario Rizzo : Yes. I won't go into any state specific detail, but what I will say is we're open broadly. The 26% increase in new business that you saw was not concentrated in a handful of states. It was pretty broad as well, but so -- were the retention decline. So really it's a combination of all those things kind of working together. There's markets that grew in total. There's others that did not. But we're focused on having all of them turn positive at some point. Unidentified Analyst : Got you. And then so with the auto retention being down a point sequentially, and then PIFs were down 50bps, this is auto. Like, is the majority of the declines in those metrics driven by California, New York, New Jersey, just given, like the big rate increases we saw, that were implement, I guess approved in December. They were kind of implemented throughout the year. And then when would you kind of expect in, I guess excluding those three states, right? That PIF improved quarter-over-quarter. Trying to get a sense of how big of a drag those three states have? Tom Wilson : Yes. The quarter-over-quarter change in retention, I know came up across a number of reports that came out. Let me just comment on that because there's really two things going on. Some of the decline, probably about 40% of the decline is attributable to a handful of states. It's California as well as New York and New Jersey that are having a meaningful impact quarter-over-quarter. And again that's driven by some of the larger rate increases that we've implemented this year. There's another portion of it that I think reinforces why we made the disclosure change. We did, which is about 60% of that sequential decline in retention is attributed to -- we're migrating some legacy encompass books of business in some reasonably large states to National General. One of those states is California. And what that does is it drags down the Allstate brand renewal ratio. But as those policies -- as those customers opt to take a National General policy, it shows up in National General's numbers. So that's where looking at it by brand is -- I'm sorry, it was insurance. I misspoke. I said encompass, their legacy assurance customers. But that's why looking at it by brand, you just see -- as we operate the business in total with multiple brands, some of those brand metrics get distorted. So we just think it's more constructive to look at the total. Mario Rizzo : And I think look at the long term number. We're down 2.7 points. We think it should be able to go up from there. So quarter-to-quarter we'll do full attribution on it. We're happy to talk about it. But it's the real drivers who just raise prices a lot, so a lot of people wouldn't shop. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Your question please. David Motemaden : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could just comment on your expectations for the timing of the retention ratio improvements. I know that you mentioned leveling off of rate increases should help retention. So I'm wondering, are you seeing any evidence of that here in October or is it still too early to tell? Tom Wilson : First, obviously sooner is better than later. So we're all on it. The whole team's on it. There's a whole bunch of stuff we're doing that Mario mentioned to make it move and you can see benefits in individual states. So we have some pretty large states that it's actually up. So we have confidence that we know how to manage our way through this. But we haven't really done a projection on that. We're comfortable giving to everybody to say here's the number you should count on. What we do know is as Mario pointed out is we expect to grow market share and personal profit liability and that's by doing transformative growth. In the near term we have to get retention up and continue to expand our new business. But then longer term all the work we're doing there is just even more sustainable. So rolling out ASC auto, ASC homeowners, all that work will drive long term growth. David Motemaden : Got it, thanks. It definitely feels like you guys are pretty confident around just the -- or feel optimistic that the tempering rate increases should help improve that retention. I mean from your standpoint is it really just -- we're sort of just having this timing impact from these three big states that need to just sort of work their way through, and like we're on the cusp here of a turn, or I mean I'm just trying to understand how you guys are thinking about it internally? Tom Wilson : We're thinking about we need to do a better job for our customers. So, we're charging them a lot more, they expect more, they deserve more. Some of that's because their cars and stuff and Bob the injury claims are higher, but like we need to do a good job for them. So it's not just oh let's wait this out and not take a bunch of price increases and it'll bounce back. We're actively working on this year alone we have a goal on double-digit millions of improving the customer experience individual transactions. We'll have another goal for next year that will be similar, but different. We're working on how do, we get more precise on the price. So if you're an elderly person, you don't drive much, you should have Milewise you'll cut your price in half. So we're not, we're not, it's not like we just think oh we're through this. I think this is just provide our - we use our operational excellence and capabilities, to go back in now and fine tune the fact that we had to raise prices a lot, so we can keep more customers. David Motemaden : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your question, please. Josh Shanker : Yes, thank you for getting me at the end. Two questions, one whimsical and one numbers. You talked about sort of cracking the code, on how to get people to buy homeowners insurance online. How far away are we from being able to call Allstate and getting into an AI conversation with Dennis Haysbert or Dean Winters that knowledgeable about what you can do to save money, by switching to Allstate and what you can do for your policy? Tom Wilson : I love whimsical questions, but I would say that one's probably not whimsical really. We have a - I'd say let's call sales sidekick, which will help people do a better job of interacting with customers. It's going to dramatically change the way that the people interact with other people, which is why Mario was talking about how we have to reposition the off-site agents. It gives us an opportunity to do that at lower cost. So work they had to do before where they couldn't do, or they had lower close rates, because they didn't know some stuff will increase their productivity, and make them even better. So, we're feeling really good about where that might go. And I think, if you look at our web stuff on ASC, that's quite sophisticated too. So Mario, what would you add? Mario Rizzo : Yes, the only other thing I'd add, Josh, that makes it not as whimsical as you might think, is we have a lot of data on homeowners, both in terms of customers we've insured in the past and just on the homes across the country in general, which I think facilitates our ability to do what you described, and be really efficient - intelligently being able to price and manage the homeowner risk. So that's the other component I think that gets us and creates the ability to do what you, what you suggested Josh Shanker : And then numbers look, ad spend is way up as you look to grow the business. I'm multiplying your number on that buy premium and seeing it up substantially. You also gave us a lot of data around new issued applications, and we can make some guesses around gross new customers. The ad spend is up significantly more than the new customer acquisition. Can you talk a little about what is sensible acquisition cost per customer, how we should think about it. And clearly are you getting the kind of pack on new business that you can make a return over a two or three year period on that investment? Tom Wilson : A bunch of questions in this, and let me end on this one first. Advertising is a little bit like driving a car when you first, when you hit the gas pedal it doesn't take off right away. It takes a while to get to 60. So you've seen us do that. We like the performance we see in terms of brand consideration. We like the number of quotes that have gone up, and we like our close rate. So but if you said, did we get back every dollar we spent economically as we're ramping it up? No you, you're kind of investing some for the future. That said, we have highly sophisticated metrics around it and it's both upper and lower funnel. If you break it into upper funnel being, kind of brand image stuff, lower funnel being, I send you, I got a specific lead and I buy that lead and I know you're shopping. So we have highly sophisticated math around that. It continues to be a sophistication game. We think we're pretty good at it. Outside people tell us we're pretty good at it. That said, you can always be better. And when you're spending billions of dollars, you ought to be really good at it. So, we're feeling good about the investment to-date. We think we can continue to spend more, and that will drive economic growth. But if it doesn't, we have the ability to just dial it down whenever we want. It's not really that complicated. So thank you all for this. Our goal, of course, is to increase personal profit, liability and market share, which we talked a lot about today. Also broaden our Protection offerings, well capitalized, we have good shareholder returns, and we look forward to seeing you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

To ask a question during this session, you'll need to press star one one on your phone. If your question has been answered and you wish to remove yourself from the program, it is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Alastair Gobin of investor relations. Please go ahead, sir. Alastair Gobin : Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning. Welcome to The Allstate Corporation's fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted related material on our website at allstateinvestors.com. Our management team will provide perspective on our strategy and an update on results. After prepared remarks, we will have a question and answer session. As noted on the first slide of the presentation, our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor supplement, and forward-looking statements about The Allstate Corporation's operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2023 and other public documents for information on potential risks. Our 10-K for 2024 will be published later this month. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom Wilson : Good morning. We appreciate you investing time at The Allstate Corporation. I'll start with an overview, and then Mario and Jess will go through the operating sales. Let's begin on slide two. So as you know, Allstate's strategy has two components : increased personal property liability market share and then expand protection provided to customers, which is shown in the two o's on the left-hand side. On the right hand, you can see Allstate's strong performance in 2024 and the topics we're gonna cover this morning. Total revenues were $16.5 billion in the fourth quarter, up 11.3% compared to the prior year quarter. Allstate generated net income of $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, and $4.6 billion for the full year. Adjusted net income return on equity was 26.8%. Let me just repeat that, 26.8% over the last twelve months. Successful risk return management resulted in excellent underwriting and investment. Transformative growth has strengthened our competitive position. We'll spend a few minutes on that today. The sale of our group health and employee voluntary benefits to companies with greater strategic alignment will generate $3.25 billion of expected proceeds representing attractive valuation multiples. Let's move on to slide three. That shows the operational execution produced excellent financial results in the quarter and for the full year. Revenues increased to $64.1 billion in 2024. Property liability earned premiums were up 10.6% in the quarter and 11.2% for the full year. Net investment income was up 37.9% about the prior year. Tom Wilson : And up almost 25% for the full year. Income was $1.9 billion in the quarter and $4.6 billion for the full year. Adjusted net income, which, you know, we make a few changes on amortization of intangibles, things we just can walk you through. The amount was $7.67 per share for the fourth quarter. On the lower right, you can see the adjusted net income return to that equity was 26.8%. So 2024 was an excellent year for Allstate both financially and strategically. Let's move on and talk strategically about transformative growth at slide four. We launched this project in December of 2019. So five years have gone by, so that'd be a good time to give you a five-year look as to where we are. And as you know, there's five components at the plan to increase market share and property liability, two of which we'll cover today. Improving customer value requires us to lower our cost and provide differentiated products. As you can see on the right-hand side, the adjusted expense ratio, which excludes advertising cost, has improved almost five points since 2019 by eliminating work outsourcing and digitizing activity using less real estate and lowering distribution. That's just lower cost enable us to offer more competitive prices. Tom Wilson : Without impacting margins. Substantial progress has also been made in introducing products. New products. So affordable simple connected auto insurance is now in thirty-one states. And the new homeowners product is in four states. Differentiated custom three sixty middle market standard and preferred auto and homeowners price have also been introduced to the independent agent channel in thirty states. One of the most significant changes is the expansion of customer access to improve growth. So this effort has three components. Improve Allstate agent productivity, expand direct sales, and increase independent agent distribution, all of which have been successful. Allstate agency productivity has increased. Enhancement to direct capabilities, lower pricing, and increased advertising is attracting more self-directed customers. The National General acquisition significantly expanded our presence in and capabilities in the independent agent channel. As you can see on the right, in 2019, more than three out of four new business policies came from the Allstate agent. Last year, new business was 9.7 million items. Seventy-six percent higher than 2019, significant contributions from each channel. Policies in force have increased from thirty to set from the two thirty-seven point three million despite the negative impact of those pandemic price increases. Transformative growth has positioned us for personal profit liability, market share growth, you'll hear more about from Mario. So now let me move on to Mario on property liability. Mario Rizzo : Thanks, Tom. Let's turn to slide five. At the top of the table, you can see fourth quarter property liability underwriting income of $1.8 billion improved by $507 million compared to the prior year. Auto insurance generated $603 million of underwriting income, an improvement of $510 million compared to the prior year quarter and reflecting the successful execution of the profit improvement plan. Homeowners insurance underwriting income was also strong at $1.1 billion. This was $99 million lower than the prior year quarter due to increased catastrophe losses. The bottom half of the table, you see the strong margins delivered during the quarter. With the total property liability recorded combined ratio of 86.9 reflecting a 2.6 point improvement compared to the prior year. Auto and homeowner combined ratios in the quarter were both better than the targets for those businesses of mid-nineties for auto and low nineties for homeowners. Now we'll expand on the auto insurance margins on slide six. We you can see how successful execution of the auto profit improvement plan has restored profitability back to target levels. The fourth quarter auto insurance recorded combined ratio of 93.5 was 5.4 points below prior year quarter as average earned premium outpaced loss cost. As a reminder, we regularly review claims severity expectations throughout the year. If the expected severity for the current year changes, we record the year to date impact in the current quarter even though a portion of that impact is attributable to previous quarters. For 2022 through 2024, the bars in the graph reflect the updated average severity estimates as of the end of each of those years to remove the volatility related to entry year severity adjustments. The table at the bottom of the graph shows actual reported combined ratios. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the full year claims severity estimate went down there was a benefit from prior quarters included in the fourth quarter's reported results. This benefit was worth 1.5 points in the fourth quarter with the adjusted quarterly combined ratio of 95 shown in the furthest bar to the right. Let's turn to slide seven where you can see that homeowners insurance produced attractive returns and group policies in force in 2024. With an industry leading product, advanced pricing, underwriting, and analytics, broad distribution capabilities, and a comprehensive reinsurance program we will continue to win the homeowner's business. On the left, you can see some of the key factors that contributed to strong results. Including increased written premium of 15.3% in the fourth quarter compared to prior year. Reflecting higher average gross written premium per policy and policy enforced growth of 2.4%. For the full year 2024, the homeowners insurance business recorded a combined ratio of 90.1 in line with our low nineties target, while generating total underwriting profit of $1.3 billion. Mario Rizzo : So the combined ratio for 2024 improved by 16.7 points primarily driven by lower catastrophe losses and strong underlying loss performance. The chart on the right shows Allstate's strong track record of profitability in homeowners insurance. Allstate produced a recorded combined ratio of 92 over the past ten years which compares favorably to the industry which experienced an underwriting loss a combined ratio of 103 over that same time period. Now let's go to a homeowner pertinent topic on slide eight. And discuss the California wildfires. So Allstate responded quickly empathetically to help customers and communities after the tragic wildfires in Southern California. Deployed mobile claim centers and over nine hundred team members to assist customers. Helping our customers recover from the fires, is our principal priority. The financial impact of the wildfires reflects the comprehensive risk and return approach we've taken to managing the homeowners insurance business. Allstate made the decision to reduce California exposure beginning in 2007. Our homeowners market share has been reduced by over fifty percent since that time, as you can see on the chart on the left. While it is early and we have not been able to adjust many claims, current gross losses are estimated at $2 billion which includes loss adjustment expenses, and an estimated California fair plan assessment. Reinsurance recoveries of $900 million net of reinstatement premiums would reduce the net loss to $1.1 billion which will be reflected in first quarter 2025 earnings. Each additional $100 million in gross losses above our current estimate would result in $10 million of net losses since we are above the reinsurance attachment point of $1 billion. We will continue to monitor the development of this event and provide any updates with our January catastrophe release which we'll make on February twentieth. Looking forward, let's discuss policy and force trends in the property liability business on slide nine. The chart to the left shows the composition of property liabilities thirty-seven point five million policies in force. Auto is the largest at twenty-four point nine million. Homeowners represents approximately twenty percent of policies enforced. As you can see on the right side of the page, auto insurance policies in force declined by 1.4%. A decline in customer retention particularly in states with large recent rate increases more than offset a nearly thirty percent increase in new business applications in the quarter. Auto policies enforced did increase in thirty-one states representing approximately sixty percent of countrywide written premium on a year over year basis. Mario Rizzo : In the middle column on the right, you can see that homeowners insurance policy is enforced increased by one hundred and seventy-three thousand or 2.4% driven by strong retention and a 20.5% increase in new business. We view homeowners as a growth opportunity across all distribution channels. Our objective in 2025 is to grow property liability policy and continuing strong new business sales. We are proactively contacting customers to lower the cost of protection to increase retention. Completing the rollout of affordable simple, and connected auto and homeowners products will also enable growth. In addition to improving the customer experience, these products contain our most sophisticated rating plans and telematics offerings. Which will deliver profitable growth and position us to compete effectively in a market where more carriers are looking to grow. We will also continue to invest in marketing and leverage broad distribution to grow property liability market share. To provide transparency to investors on our progress on growth, monthly disclosure of policies in force will be provided beginning with our next monthly release in a couple of weeks. Now I'll turn it over to Jess. Jess Merten : Alright. Thank you, Mario. Slide ten provides insights on performance and asset allocation. By taking a proactive approach to portfolio management, Allstate optimizes return for you to the risk across the enterprise. This disciplined approach includes comprehensive monitoring of economic conditions, market opportunities, interest rates, and credit spreads. The chart on the left shows a quarterly trend of net investment income our fixed income earned yield. Market based income of $727 million, which is shown in blue, was $123 million above the prior year quarter, reflecting a higher fixed income yield and increased assets under management. Fixed income yields shown below the chart has steadily increased as we repositioned into higher yielding longer duration assets. Increasing forty basis points from point zero percent to 4.4% over the past year. Performance based income of $167 million shown in black was $107 million above the prior year quarter where reflecting higher private equity and real estate investment results. We've mentioned previously, our performance based portfolio is intended to provide long term value creation and volatility on these assets from quarter to quarter is expected. Pie chart on the right shows our asset allocation as of year end 2024. As you can see, our portfolio is largely comprised of high quality, liquid, interest bearing assets. Public equity holdings were increased by $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter and now comprised $3.3 billion or approximately 5% of the total portfolio. Fixed income duration was 5.3 years, which is in line with prior year quarter and up from 4.8 years at the end of last year. Let's turn to slide eleven and discuss protection plans business which is a key component of protection services and advance our strategy to expand protection while generating profitable growth. Jess Merten : Protection plans offers protection that prepares or replaces a wide range of consumer products, including electronics, computers and tablets, TVs, mobile phones, major appliances, and furniture that are either damaged or broken. The products are distributed through strong retail relationships. Revenues of $528 million in the fourth quarter grew 20.3% prior year, driven by both domestic and international expansion. Profitable growth resulted in adjusted net income for the quarter of $37 million, which is consistent with the prior year quarter, and an increase for the full year of $40 million to $157 million reflecting the benefit of higher revenues and claims cost improvements. The business has profitably grown to approximately 160 million policies adding 60 million since 2019 through broad distribution and protection offerings as well as geographic expansion. Additionally, revenue has increased to nearly $2 billion in 2024, reflecting 23.9% in annual compounded growth since 2019 while generating more than three quarters of a billion dollars in adjusted net income 2019 to 2024 as growth offsets expansion investments. We continue to invest in this driving business as evidenced by the recent acquisition of Kingfisher, which enhances our mobile phone protection capabilities. I would like to transition slide twelve into discuss how the sale of the employer voluntary benefits and group health businesses create shareholder value. As a reminder, the decision to pursue the sale of health and benefit was based on the assumption that these businesses would have greater strategic value to other companies and selling them would maximize shareholder value. The transactions we've announced support this assumption. In August, we agreed to sell the employer voluntary benefits business to Stancorp Financial for $2 billion. We expect to close that in the first half of 2025. Last week, we marked another major milestone with our agreement to sell the group health business to Nationwide for $1.25 billion which we expect to close sometime in 2025. Both of these transactions are economically and financially attractive for our shareholders, The combined proceeds of these sales are $3.25 billion with an expected book gain of approximately $1 billion. Using trailing twelve months adjusted net income, the combined estimated impact of the transactions on adjusted net income return on equity then a decrease of about 180 basis points due to lower income and higher equity resulting from the gains on sale. As a reminder, the Group Health business is part of National General, which we acquired in January of 2021 for $4 billion. The proceeds from this divestiture combined with about a billion dollars in dividends that we received from National General statutory legal entities represents a return of more than half of the original purchase price while the sides with the National General Property Liability business approximately doubled. Touching briefly on the results of health and benefits for the quarter. Premium and contract charges for the segment increased 3.2% or $15 million compared to the prior year quarter, Individual and group health business saw strong growth with premiums and contract charges up 8% and 9.8% respectively. This growth was partially offset by a modest decrease in employer voluntary benefits. Adjusted net income for the segment of $35 million in the third quarter was $25 million lower than the prior year quarter as increased benefit utilization across all three businesses impacted profitability. Underwriting and rate actions are being taken to quickly address benefit ratio trends and restore margins to historical levels. Options for the individual health business, which has adjusted an income of $30 million for 2024, are being evaluated and the business will either be retained or combined with another company. Let's close on slide thirteen by reviewing Allstate's strategy to create shareholder value. As you can see on this page, we create value by delivering attractive financial returns executing transformative growth to increase property liability market share, expanding protection offerings, completing the sales of employee voluntary benefits and group health businesses. So with that context, I'd like to open up the line for your questions. Operator : Certainly. And our first question for today comes from the line of Rob Cox from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please? Rob Cox : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So first question for you, I had on advertising. I think you all had previously said that you were pretty comfortable with the 3Q 2024 level of advertising spend. Was hoping you could talk about the decision to ramp it up here in the fourth quarter. And I'm curious, what your measures of ad spend efficiency are telling you in the current environment, and how does that compare to history? Tom Wilson : So, Rob, we're comfortable with our advertised spending. We adjusted obviously, by quarter to point out, and it also depends which markets we're after. Sometimes we do some heavy up tests in particular months to see what the sense is. I can assure you we have state of the art analytics on that. It's everything every kind of lead we bid on leads automatically. We just to make sure we were good last year, we had a number of outside people come in and look at our analytics. And we appear to be at least contemporary, if not industry leading. Now, you know, some of these are people you're buying ads from, they're not gonna come tell you stupid. But when we look at it in total, we think we're really good at it. And we have all kinds of allowable acquisition cost measures that look at everything from quote to close ratios to lifetime value. Rob Cox : Got it. Thank you. Secondly, I wanted to ask a question on the comment in the press release about expecting growth in total property liability PIF in 2025. You know, we've been thinking that you could certainly grow PIF in both home and auto in 2025. Is there any reason why you would be hesitant to commit to growing in both of the segments, or am I looking too deeply into that statement? Let me make a comment and then turn it over to Mario. Tom Wilson : So first, as you know, we don't give forward-looking projections on PIF growth. So what we've said to help bring some clarity to it is we're just gonna give you the numbers every month like we do with cats, and you can decide what you wanna do with that. We're obviously already growing at home, and we have plans we talked a little bit in the press release on where we're growing at auto. But in total, we're not growing in auto. So Mario is working on that. Mario, you wanna talk about what you got going? Mario Rizzo : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Rob. Look, I'd say look, the objective of transformative growth is to grow policies in force and gain market share in the property liability business. That's our goal. That's our objective. Having said that, as Tom mentioned, we're currently growing the homeowners business. We think there's a real opportunity in the market. We're gonna continue to lean in on that one. A, because we've got really strong capabilities. B, there's disruption in the market that we can take advantage of, and we like the prospects of continuing to grow homeowners. On the auto side, we think despite the fact that policies are declining, we're really well positioned to lean into growth going forward for a variety of reasons. I think the first is, you've seen the new business momentum build over the course of 2024. In part due to your first question, our advertising investment that we've increased throughout the year, but we've also been doing things like unwinding underwriting restrictions and looking to accelerate growth across all distribution channels. We're gonna continue to fully leverage our broad distribution capabilities alongside that marketing investment continue to roll out new affordable, simple, and connected product. We are currently in thirty-one states. We'll continue to expand that. Over the course of this year. That has our most sophisticated pricing our most contemporary telematics offerings included in that. We're gonna continue to leverage capabilities on the Allstate side. International General just talked about the growth that we've seen in National General. We're gonna leverage middle market capabilities in Allstate to grow National General in a part of the market that they have less penetration in. We're also gonna use National General's capabilities in the nonstandard auto space and leverage the Allstate brand to begin to accelerate growth in that space. So we've got a lot of things that we've both been doing and expect to do in 2025 to accelerate growth and, really, that was the genesis of the statement. Oh, yeah. One last point I should have brought up is retention. Yeah. Everything I talked about was on the new business side. You know, we've seen the adverse impact of retention as we've been having to raise prices over the last couple of years. To improve margins. The good news is auto margins are back where we would want them to be in the mid-nineties range. The downside of that is, retention. Has taken a hit. Some of that will come back as we are less active in taking prices going forward because of where margin sits. But additionally, and more importantly, we're gonna proactively lean into reaching out to customers, helping them save money, by making sure they're getting all the appropriate discounts, they've got the right coverage levels that meet their specific needs, and the objective there is to improve affordability, improve customer satisfaction, and retention and that will be added into our growth trends. Rob Cox : Very much for the answers. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Your question, please. Gregory Peters : Good morning, everyone. So for my first question, feedback on the last answer there, Mario. And you know, you said on slide nine here for the auto policies, you said that you're proactively contacting existing customers. You mentioned that in your answer. Can you give us an updated perspective on how you think your pricing is on a competitive positioning basis versus your peer group and as you shift gears and proactively contact existing customers, does that mean that there's gonna be some sort of corresponding adjustment in agent compensation that's gonna give more weighting to retention versus just flat out new sales? Tom Wilson : Right. Let me the pricing was complicated, so I'm gonna let Mario do that one. But I would make one point on the retention part. I think having branded agents who work exclusively with you is the best channel to be able to do what we're talking about. So, you know, we've raised some people's prices thirty, forty percent. We had to do it quickly because we're losing money. Now we can go back in and help them get the absolute right coverage. That could be deductibles. It could be coverage limits. It could be using telematics. It could be paying differently. So there's lots of different ways we can help them do that. And that would be very difficult to do in through an independent agent channel. It would be harder to do with a direct channel because you don't have the skills and capabilities built in your call centers necessarily do that. Our agents the Allstate agents are used to doing this all the time. They certainly did it when we were raising rates. But now Mario has a new program going on, which is a safe program to which has specific goals, numbers. We are not planning on changing agent comp. Margaret, do you wanna talk about competitive position in? Mario Rizzo : Yes. Thanks, Greg. The and competitive position, I'd say a couple of things. First, when you look at the ramp up in new business over the course of the year, and, you know, we made a comment that we're growing in thirty-one states currently. I think that's indicative of having competitive prices and being able to, you know, fully leverage the marketing investment that we're making. It is a complicated question. It's hard to answer it on a national basis because, obviously, we compete market by market, state by state, and we're constantly looking at our competitive position and making tweaks to, you know, the tiers within our pricing plan to adjust prices when we think it's appropriate to adjust prices. Good news is, you know, we've achieved target margins. So we're comfortable with where our rate level is currently. And we would expect that we would need to take less price going forward. But when you look at our new business trends, we feel good about competitive prices. We've taken a lot of cost out of the system over the past several years, as Tom mentioned earlier, which is helpful. We're gonna continue to pull that lever going forward. But we think we're priced competitively and we have the broad distribution capabilities to continue to grow in the auto space. The only other point I'd make on your second question about the proactively contacting customers and agency compensation a meaningful portion of the agent compensation currently relates to renewal. So they've got a strong economic vested interest in retaining as many customers as they possibly can. And as Tom mentioned, they've been doing that. This is a way through the same program where we're gonna really scale it and do it much more broadly. To help drive retention proactively versus just relying on less instability in the market from rate increases. Gregory Peters : Thanks for that information. Tom, in as my follow-up question, Tom, in your opening comments, when you were going through the information on slide two, you emphasized the ROE of 26.8%, which I could believe is one of the best results I've seen from your company in recent history. Can you provide some view of how you are thinking about the ROE going forward and maybe what the board how the board's viewing it. I guess the reason why I'm asking is, you know, you've disposed of some underperforming assets, you know, over the last decade, and it feels like there's just a natural migration that the ROE objectives for the organization can be moving up certainly this result for last year sort of puts an explanation point on that. Tom Wilson : Good question, Greg. And with longitudinal perspective on it. So as you remember, I don't remember how many years ago it was. At one time, we put out a target of fourteen to seventeen percent. But I would say that was a different company and a different time. It was a different company and that we had a life business. It was a different time and that interest rates were a lot lower. People were thinking it was low for bond. Since then, of course, as you point out, we've made a bunch of changes. We've sold the life business. We bought back a substantial amount of stock, which takes some of our investment earnings down. Our premiums are up substantially. Not just because we've grown total policies, but also because there's just higher cost per policy which I think the market isn't really affected and that that includes requires more capital. So when you look all through it, we feel really good about where we're at. When we put that fourteen to seventeen percent out there, it was really because investors were not sure given the time and given the nature of the company where our returns would be and would they be acceptable. We never said it was capped. And so, obviously, now we're doing better than that. I would say the most important thing for us to do now is to increase growth. So increasing returns won't drive that much more shareholder value. What will drive more shareholder value is growth. And we've obviously growing and are growing a bunch of our other businesses. So whether that's our homeowners business, whether that's for growing premiums, which people kind of get all focused in on auto pay, and AutoPIP is important, and we're gonna grow AutoPIP. But when you look at just growth in premiums, you know, we're up double digit single low low teens percent depending which measure you wanna look at last year. So we feel good about overall growth think and the key to unlocking the value we've already created through growth is to get auto unit growth up. Gregory Peters : Got it. Thanks for the answers. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski from BMO. Your question please. Michael Zaremski : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. And my first question is on the expense ratio and kudos to to kinda, you know, lowering it over time and and meeting your goal. Curious. I think in the in the past, Tom, recent past, you said that you have plans to to improve it even further. Maybe I'm maybe that's the expense ratio x add expense. If that's the case, are you able to kind of elaborate on what the building blocks are going forward to to to continue the improvements. Tom Wilson : So yeah. So the answer is yes. We always expect to keep reducing expenses, and we think we have an opportunity to even lower them farther from where they are now. We're not done. I would say, you know, maybe we're sixty percent of the way done. And, you know, and I but I wouldn't, like, take that and multiply that by some percentage change because part of that percentage change just to be completely transparent is because premiums have gone up faster than general inflation. So you kinda can't count can't count that as as much. So we are constantly work I think the where is we're after will be digitization. Leveraging the new technology platform we built the affordable simple connected is all designed around doing that increasing our marketing effectiveness. So even though we carve marketing out from that number, that doesn't mean, like, we're just gonna spend wild on marketing. It needs to have the same level of precision and to it that everything else does. And we also still need to lower distribution cost. You know, the distribution costs are still higher than we would like them to be, so we have work to do there as well. Michael Zaremski : Great. And my final follow-up is just more high level on the devastating tragedy in California. I know it's kinda still a fluid situation, but I think a few of your competitors have, you know, expressed as a vet they might need to retrench even more in California given the payback the potential payback on the losses are going to be many, many, many years. Curious if you think this could cause Allstate to also rethink its ambitions of growing or or just just overall growth in in California might might My My a different direction. Thanks. Tom Wilson : Well, every state's different. We don't have any growth aspirations in homeowners in California at this point. And we haven't since 2007, really. We had a small window in there where we thought we had some arrangements where it would make sense for us to grow, that didn't turn out to be the case. So we had turned off the spigot for new customers. We didn't go nav for new people, but we just said we're not gonna take add new customers. Starting in 2007. Then in about 2017, eighteen, I'm looking at my here. Yeah. We said, you know, we think we can take on a few new customers to That didn't turn out to be true, so we stopped that then in 2022. But we've been at this a long time. And so we don't have any growth aspirations in California right now. That said, we're really good at homeowners. We make more than half of the industry's profits. We've got a good business model. We think it's a great growth opportunity. And it doesn't have to be the way it is in California. So Texas has just as many types and dollar amount of losses as California does, yet the homeowners market works there. And so we believe that there's a way to make that work. We'd like to work with a state to make it work because people want to insure their homes. They need to ensure their homes. And we just need to make sure it's done on a basis that is fair to consumers, but also gives our shareholders an appropriate return for the risk. So example, we don't wanna have to do things like in California. Mario talked about the numbers. We have a substantial amount of reinsurance recoveries. We're a cost plus business. We did not the cost for that reinsurance that we just now got back to with lower losses. Which means that, you know, we need to have a structure. The departments talked about that. They're open to that. So I would say that these things you know, they happen over a long time, and it takes a while for them to get. So I don't think anything's gonna change in the next you know, it's not like in twelve months. Everybody's gonna be rushing into California to write homeowners. It just doesn't happen that fast. Michael Zaremski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christian Getzoff from Wells Fargo. Your question, please. Christian Getzoff : Hi. Good morning. My first question is on retention. I didn't see any retention numbers in the press release for supplements. I was wondering if you could provide that. And then you say the majority of the headwinds on retention just from, like, know you guys called out Esurance migration and then the New York, California, New Jersey rate hikes. Are those is the majority of that headwind paid it by now, or do you expect some further headwinds kind of in the first half? Tom Wilson : I'll make a couple comments then, Jess. May wanna comment. So at first, we've paid a lot of attention to attention in it. In more granularity than you just even mentioned, whether it's this book of business, this state, his risk cover, his whatever, you know, his price changes. We're like, we're all over retention. Just made the decision that rather than give you the components which are complicated and we spend a bunch of time helping you spend a bunch of time trying to figure out retention on this much and how much policy too. Just just so why don't I just give you the numbers? I'll just give you the fifth numbers every month. You'll know what the numbers are. You don't have to get caught up into what's your projections on new business, what's your projection on retention, presurience policy. So the our goal was to increase transparency and give you more information you can use to make your investment in recommendation decisions rather than less into an So that that's what we've set out to do. Maybe Jess or Mario, you guys wanna talk about the retention and how you're feeling about it and other ways to measure it. Maybe I'll just touch on this round out the disclosure, and then, Mario, you can talk about your thoughts. You know, I think the other thing, you know, to keep in mind is, as Tom mentioned, we gave you component a component. We didn't even give you all of the components. We believe by giving you tip on a monthly basis, you'll have more transparency. Recall, what we gave you was Allstate brand, gift or Allstate brand retention rather. So it was a piece of the puzzle and we spent a lot of time explaining movements between brands which we wanted to move away from. So I really believe that that what we're giving you now on a monthly basis will be much clearer and actually, you know, reduce a lot of the complication that came from our disclosure. And as Tom said, put you in a better position to understand new business and retention trends and frankly with the total policy in force trend is. So it was definitely a move to increase transparency by taking away and really completing that move away from brand to line of business and distribution channel. Mario Rizzo : Yeah. The only thing I'd add on on retention, I think it's important to take a step back and look at what we've really been saying over the last several years, which our principal focus would say, you know, heading into 2024, was to improve auto margins. I think we were pretty clear on that. That was our principal priority. We had to take prices up a lot to do that over forty percent when you look over the past several years. The good news is, you know, margins are back to where we want them to be and where they need to be. And as from a new business perspective, as best kind of played out, you've seen us kind of lean back into the market and really accelerate new business growth over the course of last year. The downside to that approach and that strategy with retention as you mentioned, which has stabilized in a number of states as we've cycled through what we needed to do to improve profitability. But as we talked about before, there were a handful states that were a little later to the game in terms of getting margins back to where they needed to be. We talked extensively about California, New York, New Jersey, The good news is we've been making good progress in those three states. We've been making it by implementing some pretty meaningful rate increases. That is having a drag on retention as we cycle our way through that. We should see that stabilize. I will say though, New York and New Jersey, we still got some work to do. We're our margins are better, but they're not where we'd like them to be. We're gonna continue to pursue rate in those states. But we, you know, believe we can overcome that. Because we got a lot of growth opportunity in the rest of the country. Christian Getzoff : Gotcha. Thank you. And going back to the California wild losses, I know you provided a $2 billion gross s You provided some sensitivity, but what are you assuming in terms of the industry losses so we could, like, flex that sensitivity up or down depending on how the losses develop. Mario Rizzo : Yeah. Look. And the this is Mario. The way I'd answer that question is, obviously, there's a lot of moving parts in in our estimate. We know our data with a lot of specificity because we have that. We've made assumptions around a fair plan assessment just given the, you know, the the the magnitude of the of the losses we've seen and also when you when you look at the fare plan surplus level as of the end of the third quarter, their reinsurance and their co participation in that, we think it's pretty likely that they're gonna you know, kind of exceed their their surplus levels and there will likely be an assessment. We've got that in there. And we you know, our our our number includes a view of what the industry loss is. I really don't wanna to kind of disclose what our view on that is, but there's I will say we've made certain assumptions to come up with our number both in terms of ourselves and the fair plan. We'll keep looking at those because it's a pretty fluid process and we'll update it as we get more information. If we need to update. Tom Wilson : So here's if you want a sensitivity. For every hundred million, it's ten million bucks. So for every five percent or often total, it costs us ten million dollars. So if we're off by fifty percent, so it's another billion dollars, it costs us a hundred million. Right? So the I don't think you need to worry about sensitivity on the gross loss. Christian Getzoff : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timmy Peller from JPMorgan. Your question please. Timmy Peller : Hey. Good morning. I had a question first on just the auto business. You mentioned PIF turning positive in thirty-one states, I think. And I'm assuming what's unique about those states is just the fact that you're not raising prices as much. And advertising more. So if that is true, then could you talk about of the remaining that you're not growing in, should that begin, happen throughout the year gradually, or is there more of a cliff event? Some point later in the year? When you will lap those comps and you're not gonna be raising prices just to sort of be able to assess when those stocks, states will begin to show better growth. Tom Wilson : Timmy, I'll let Mario talk about the pace, but I don't think he's gonna give you an answer by quarter. Alright. I got it. It's more complicated though than just those two factors. Alright? So it's not just, are we not taking price? And how much are we advertising is what's everybody else doing? What kind of coverage are we offering, where are we with our ASC roll out, where are we with our custom three c. So it's a really complicated machine that Mario's running. And but the goal is sometimes attribution helps explain why you are you're on Sometimes attribution leads to excuses. And we're not interested in excuses. We're interested in results, which grows. So Mario can talk about how these thinking about that maybe you wanna talk about both the impact of retention and the impact of new business over the course there, but we can't give you, obviously, a per quarter PIP number. Just watch for Jess's monthly number. Mario Rizzo : Yeah. Timmy, thanks for the question. Look, at lower where I'd say is like, we wanna grow in every state where it makes economic sense for us to grow and where we believe we can grow profitably. That happens to be thirty-one states now. We think the opportunity is beyond that level. And as Tom mentioned, there's a lot of components that factor into our ability to grow price is part of it, competitive position, and where our price hits relative to competition. The growth investments we're making, our risk appetite, there's a lot of factors that play into that. Retention is a key component of our ability to grow. Right? So what you saw in total this year was we had really good new business trends, and in the quarter, they kind of peaked in 2024. At almost thirty percent. Yet despite that, our units declined year over year. Because of the drag of retention. So we're focused through the same program on not just waiting for retention to bounce back because of less rate disruption in the system, gonna proactively do things to work with customers help them save money, improve affordability, and drive retention up. We think doing that well alongside all the other things I mentioned earlier new product rollout, new technology, distribution, and continued investments in marketing and all the things that helped us drive new business volume. That's the key that will drive growth broadly, and that's the plan we're executing on. Timmy Peller : And then maybe just following up on capital. Like, the business is obviously profitable now. I think you'll make money even with the California buyers. In one queue, and then you've got the money coming in through the sales of the benefits and the health business. So how should we think And I'm assuming capital is not a constraint for growth given how much money you're gonna get from the sales, but should we think about capital deployment between growth, m and a, and share buybacks. And is it unreasonable to assume that you wouldn't be in the market buying back stock at some point assuming results come in as expected over the course of the CVA. Tom Wilson : Timmy, if we consider proactive capital management to be a significant strength of Allstate. And it's added tremendous amounts of shareholder value. So and you're right. Share repurchase are obviously one of those. And we've used that extensively. But would encourage you to hold us accountable as you started to mention on really a broader basis. Right? So there's organic growth, there's risk and return on economic capital, there's inorganic growth, and then there's capital structure, which includes the share repurchases. And so let me just go through each of those. First, organic growth is a twofer. And based on the returns we're getting in our business today? It generates absolute dollar growth in earnings. Secondly, with that higher growth rate and we should have a higher PE, because if you look at our price earnings ratio versus any other insurer, and you look at our top line growth, the average premium growth is getting discounted, and it's basically all hung on auto unicorns. You can start whether that's right or wrong, but we think that that the unlock of in deploying capital to grow the property liability business both in units and premiums is will drive growth. So we think that's really important. Marketing, we talked a lot about that this morning, so I don't wanna And We don't need to go back through that. If you look at risk and return on economic capital, we have a really sophisticated way in just talked about this a lot within the last couple of years of how we manage capital, and associate a risk and return on that. That helps us do things like leverage our investment our investments, and that capability generates good returns. And I think it needs to be valued in its own right. It's but for example, the duration calls we made used additional economic capital. We knew that. We decided on it. It was part of the enterprise decision, and it's clearly generated good returns. Same thing is true with the reinsurance in California. We look at all those things economically. I think acquisitions also need to be assessed on the actual return on capital. So National in general and Square screen, both both both on the standpoint. When you look at National General, it's more than double its size on apples to apples basis from when we bought three years ago. SquareTrade is substantially bigger as maybe ten times bigger and making a hundred and fifty million bucks a year when we paid a billion four four nine. Just when you look at what was the net cost of National General and SquareTrade? Jess Merten : Tell me, you take a look at you know, both of them, the net cost is about half of what we paid. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we paid $4 billion for National General. When you add up the recently announced group health transaction, and the dividends we've been able to take out of the statutory entities which are about a billion dollars, we've reduced that purchase price by about $2.25 billion. So to $1.75 or less than half. The same will be true if you look at SquareTrade in the $1.4 billion acquisition. Since owning it, we've taken about half that back in, dividends based on earnings. While also and this is important, investing in growth, doing acquisitions. So we've gotten about half of it back and still invested. In growth on SquareTrade. Tom Wilson : So and and then, of course, share repurchase is is an also thing, but you have to really look at how you manage your capital. Stack better. So for example, We issued a perpetual preferred stock. I don't remember how many years ago. We we issued two billion of stock. We bought back two billion in common, swapped fixed equity cost and left all the remaining upside with our common equity. Today. Preferred just has a what's current cost on the preferred? Jess Merten : Oh, we have three different issuances, Tom. So we're our lowest is about 4.75% and then we have a tranche that was more recently issued at 7.375%. So we've got a range, but most of it the largest issuance actually is a 5.1%. Fixed for life. So, you know, obviously, and it the math is not exactly right because you got gap, capital, and gap. But if you look at our returns, On equity, on just actual market equity, it's substantially above that. So that's a that's a good trade. The we also look obviously, look at dividends and everything else. Share repurchases, we've done a lot of. And so so just you wanna just go through the numbers of what we've done on share repurchases. We have been a lot of time. So I took a look back and went all the way back to when Allstate went public. Since going public, we've repurchased about $41.5 billion of our stock, and that represents about 83% of the outstanding shares. If you bring that time frame in a little bit, I have over the last ten years, the number is closer to $17.5 billion. And about half of the outstanding shares over the last ten years. Bringing in again five year period, $7.8 billion of repurchase is about 25% of our outstanding shares and in all cases, at an average cost, it's very attractive. We even go through and look at the returns in all cases over any period, whether it's thirty years, five years, the return is significantly above our cost to cap. So we've had really good returns. And to your point, Tom, you know, buying back 83% since going publish public just shows our commitment to reverse. Tom Wilson : Yeah. So, I mean, we've got plenty of things we do. And I would just you know, like, don't like, yes, share repurchases are important. I know it's a number of analysts wrote that up over the evening of, like, when you're gonna be back. I'm like, you should hold us accountable for manager and capital to drive shareholder value. And if that means growing faster, and using our capital to grow faster, then holds accountable for that. If we if we have extra capital, we don't hold on to it. And we buy back stock because we think, you know, when you look at our our value relative to our growth potential, the size of our business, our our PE. We still think it's cheap. Timmy Peller : Yeah. Still better to get those questions and questions about adequacy of capital, I guess. So Tom Wilson : And I thought those those were those were thoughts for sure. Timmy Peller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bob Huang from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Bob Huang : Yeah. Good morning. I'm gonna stay away from capital. So the first question is on auto. And I mean, an investor astutely pointed out that on your first quarter 2024 slide, you talked about 64% of your total premiums were profitable. So fast forward today to today, then we're talking about about 60% of that premium is now growing. Is this fair to kind of make some type of causal correlation between the time you achieve profitability and the time that you you start to grow the business? In other words, is it fair to say that six to nine months from now, essentially, California, New York, New Jersey, they're only state you're unable to grow and everything else should be growing and that rather than the 60% of total premium is growing. Probably call it eighty or ninety percent of it should be. Is that a fair way to think about this? Tom Wilson : I think the construct is right. I don't know if I would automatically extrapolate that extrapolate that into the future. I mean, it is true when we were losing money, we shut down advertising, shut down growth, be intentionally, because we said there's really no sense going to get a bunch of new customers we're gonna have to raise their price by fifteen percent relatively quickly, and it maybe then lose them. So what's the point to spend the money to getting a new customer to lose a bunch of money on, and you know you're gonna lose money on. So that is was true, and that's what we did. We also know that by driving that and going your crush we that it was going to her retention. And so now we're about so there it is a there are, you know, pieces you rolled in. I don't think you could automatically go to say, like, like, do an analysis of two line lines on a graph going up, and they would follow each you know, each sit each state's different, each position's different. You know, if if if if Mario wish to get adequate prices in New York, tomorrow, we have a great agency plant there. We have we got pretty we got huge share down in the in the New York area. And we could really leverage it to grow fast. When that will happen, who knows? So I think you should just hold us accountable for growing auto units, and I keep coming back to auto units is the unlocked A lot everything else is growing and it's like, so let's you know, it is it is an important part of our business. But we've got we got higher premiums, the reserve balances are up, the investment balances are up. That's all driving increase you know, protection plans is back in and out of the park. So we got lots of growth. We are focused on the unlock of auto unit growth. Bob Huang : Got it. No. That's that's helpful. If I can just have a follow-up on that. I I I don't know if you'll address this, so apologies if you did. The question is really around adverse selection. Right? As we go into 2025. More and more auto carriers are profitable, and more and more auto carriers are talking about growth. Should we expect your current level of combined ratio to hold for auto as you head into a environment where everyone is looking for growth? Like, how do you feel about the the broader competitive environment as a whole? Tom Wilson : Well, you're you're talking well, the auto market has obviously been competitive. And both Progressive, GEICO, State Farm, the big carriers that we compete with all the time have been out in the market and competitive this year. So people are advertising. It's it's last year, 2024. So it's not like it wasn't competitive and it's suddenly turning into competition. We think we have the capabilities to compete and grow. I would say that's a different market in homeowners where most people are backing out. There is a secular trend there. Where we have an opportunity to grow, and as we look at capital, one of the things we like to do is get a higher valuation on our homeowners growth. So when you look at our homeowner business and I said, jeez, if you have a business that's growing, you know, revenues in the mid-teens, it's it's picking up, not huge market share, but it's got you real unit growth. It's an industry leading model. It's earned money good money eleven out of twelve years. And and it has high returns on capital you probably wouldn't put it at the kind of PE that we have for our overall enterprise. And I suspect that if you actually looked at analysts, they might even give it a lower p e than our total. So we need to figure out how to have that fully recognized in our valuation. And it might mean doing something differently in reinsurance and lowering the volatility of that line. But just know that our goal is to increase shareholder value. Maybe we're close. I think we're in time. Our goal is to increase shareholder value, whether that's buy shares back grow, manage our capital structure differently, figure out how to compete differently, do more advertising. We're all about driving growth for shareholders. We think we have the tools and capabilities to do that, and we have a track record that shows we know how to get. Got So thank you all. We'll see you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
