Strayer - Acting Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President Analysts : David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division Gregory Burns - Sidoti & Company, LLC Michael Latimore - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division Daniel Toomey Rohit N. Chopra - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division Josh Goldberg - G2 Investment Partners Management LLC Operator : Good afternoon, my name is Lucy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Plantronics Quarter 1 Fiscal Year 2014 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Greg Klaben. You may begin your conference. Greg Klaben : Thanks, Lucy. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. Welcome to Plantronics' Call for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2014. Joining me today are Ken Kannappan, Plantronics' President and CEO, who's on a temporary medical leave of absence; and Pam Strayer, acting CEO, Senior Vice President and CFO. I'd like to remind you that during the course of today's conference call, we may make certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties as outlined in today's press release. As we've highlighted before, the risk factors in our press release and SEC filings are not standard boilerplate. We update these risk factors quarterly for material changes, adding and dropping language and changing the order depending upon our assessment of the timing and potential impact of risks. We believe forecasting our results of operations is difficult, and we ask you to focus particular attention on these risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. For further information, please refer to our Forms 10-Q, 10-K, today's press release and other SEC filings. For the remainder of today's call, we will be providing only non-GAAP metrics related to gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and EPS. We've reconciled these measures on -- in our earnings press release and in our quarterly analyst metric sheet, both of which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Unless stated otherwise, all comparisons of the first quarter fiscal 2014 financial results are up to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. Plantronics' first quarter fiscal 2014 net revenues were $202.8 million compared with guidance provided on May 7 of $198 million to $205 million. GAAP's diluted -- Plantronics' GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.62 compared with $0.55 in the same quarter of the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.70 compared with $0.63 in the prior year quarter. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter fiscal 2014 consists of charges for stock-based compensation, early exit lease termination, accelerated depreciation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and restructuring other related charges all net of the associated tax impact, as well as the tax benefits from the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and other tax benefits that are not reflective of ongoing operations. Please refer to the full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP in our earnings press release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. S. Kenneth Kannappan : Thank you, Greg. I'm very happy to be on the call with you today. My treatments are going well, and the doctors believe my recovery is on track. The difference you can hear in my voice is not a reflection of cancer, but rather, a side effect of the treatments and will improve. I remain actively involved in the management of the company to the extent I've been able. We will be able to communicate more about my return to full-time work following the results of diagnostic tests towards the end of September. The team has been quite busy during my leave, delivering steady results and showing wonderful progress in all fronts. I'm excited to share the financial highlights of our first quarter. We continue to evolve our UC ecosystem and strengthen our position to take advantage of the growing market with our innovations and contextual intelligence. Our first quarter fiscal 2014 revenues and earnings per share met our expectations as result of improved economic conditions in the U.S. and a mostly stable economic environment in the rest of the world. We achieved record Office & Contact Center revenues, highlighted by UC revenues growing 51% to a quarterly revenue record of $42.1 million, which represented 28% of our OCC revenues. OCC revenues, excluding UC, or as we refer to it, core OCC revenues, grew year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. We believe the growth in core OCC is attributable to a favorable timing during the quarter. This is only our second quarter of year-over-year core OCC growth. It remains unclear if this will continue as a trend. We remain optimistic that business conditions in the U.S. will remain favorable in Q2, however we anticipate the core OCC revenues will be down in the September quarter, given the favorable timing we experienced in Q1. We believe our product set -- feature set and innovation advances are allowing our OCC product category to realize stable margins and ASPs. This is also true in a very competitive UC market, where we continue to benefit from a price premium through product differentiation. We expect continued strong growth in UC in fiscal 2014 and believe that the majority of the UC market opportunity is still to come. As we reviewed last quarter, we expect the average CAGR for UC revenues is roughly 40% over the next 5 years with growth slower in the earlier portion of this timeframe. While we exceeded this growth rate in Q1, we've refrained from making quarterly forecast for UC. The UC market is still in its nascent stage, susceptible to uneven growth quarter-to-quarter, making it challenging to forecast. In the Mobile product group, revenues grew 15% year-over-year as we saw a continued but diminished lift from the hands-free driving law in China. Additionally, our 4 flagship Voyager Legend Bluetooth headset continues to enjoy global success. We recently announced an update for the stereo wireless category with our BackBeat GO 2, which is receiving great reviews. It provides improved sound and new power management features including DeepSleep technology, allowing the earbuds to keep it charged for up to 6 months. It also comes with a charging case that, when fully charged, can triple the battery life while concurrently providing users with safe and convenient storage. Additionally, we added voice prompts, popular in some of our other products, to alert users the amount of battery life remaining and to which external device it is paired. We continue to invest in our UC ecosystem to improve the contextual intelligence we provide to our UC partners. This ecosystem consist of hardware and tools for developers and integrators. The platform for development is our headset, whose features and capabilities allow for functions significantly exceeding conventional communications as a result of our open APIs and Spokes software. Our strategy is to connect our devices to applications, platforms in the cloud to make our devices indispensable for users, simplifying everyday activities to increase productivity. The Voyager Legend platform is the starting point for our investment in advanced headset capabilities, and we're exploring the potential for other form factors as well. This platform has crossover success from the consumer market to the UC market. It started with the prerequisite for headset success, superb audio quality. We then built on that core capability with sensors to capture user information and provide a development platform for our partners and developers upon which they could create custom applications. In Q1, we made strides in harnessing and delivering contextual intelligence to improve the offerings of our UC partners. At Cisco Live, we demonstrated new proximity features of the Voyager Legend and how it is uniquely integrated with the new Cisco DX650 desktop IP phone with HD video. One feature we exhibit was Smart Lock, the ability of our headset to utilize proximity information and voice authentication to lock and unlock the new Cisco phone. We also demonstrated our Smart Transfer feature, allowing users to seemly transfer mobile caller ID from your mobile handset to the DX650. At the Wearable Tech Expo, we unveiled a new concept device based on the Voyager Legend, which integrates sensors, such as a gyroscope, a compass and a pedometer, which will allow us to track head orientation in 3 dimensions. Our demonstrated integration of this with Google Street View earned us an award for Best Application at the event. We believe there is potential for a multitude of applications through such real-time device orientation data streams, including head gesturing that can provide instructions to an application, such as answering a call, advanced gaming functions, real-time navigation, for instances, when GPS isn't available, and a pedometer for health tracking. While the term is relatively new, we've been building wearable technology since our inception. Over the years, we have broadened our scope and introduced a number of new technologies that position us as a leader in this space. Our goal is to provide relevant information about a personal and physical world into applications. This marks a dramatic shift from decades of working with closed telephony systems and then serving as a catalyst for increased innovation. We continue to aim for a balance between the right level of investment in UC and ongoing innovation activities while maintaining non-GAAP operating margins of 20% to 23%, and we expect to achieve this range in fiscal 2014. At Plantronics, we take pride in utilizing the full potential of UC to enhance our workplace and corporate culture. Besides the upgrades to our facilities and Smarter Working environment, our aim is to empower our associates or, as we put it in one of our fiscal year 2014 goals, optimize the culture. Our unique culture is gaining a global reputation for excellence. We were recently recognized by WorkplaceDynamics as one of the top 20 best places to work in the San Francisco Bay Area. Similarly, for the third consecutive year, we've been recognized as the best place to work in Mexico. We continue to attract world-class talent of all levels, which is crucial to our ability to adapt and grow for the upcoming UC opportunity. Other goals for fiscal year 2014 are to deliver profitable growth, extend our brand, expand consumer reach and scale for growth. We believe achievement of these goals will allow us to continue to increase long-term stockholder value and cash flow generation. On behalf of everyone at Plantronics, I want to thank you for your continued support. We're very excited about our upcoming product introductions in all of our product groups and sharing further innovations and contextual intelligence with you. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Pam to discuss our first quarter results in more detail. Pamela J. Strayer: Thanks, Ken. I want to start with an overview before getting into more details the financial results for the quarter. First quarter net revenues were approximately $203 million, representing 12% growth over the prior year. Non-GAAP operating income of $42.4 million is an increase of $5.5 million or 15% versus a year ago. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.70 is $0.07 higher, an increase of 11%. As Ken had said, we're very pleased with this quarter's results, we had record-high revenues in the Americas region and strong growth in UC, both of which were driven primarily by growth in the U.S. Our revenues in the U.S. did benefit this quarter from a handful of large deals, more than we typically see in a single quarter. A quick note on gross margins before I get into revenue detail. Our gross margins in the first quarter were 52.6%, a decline from 54.3% in the prior year. We're seeing the impact this quarter as UC product mix has grown to a record 28% of OCC revenues. Now I'll cover revenue in more detail. Total net revenues for the first quarter of $202.8 million were up $21.4 million or 12% compared to the first quarter last year. While all of our regions experienced growth, the revenue strength in Q1 was driven primarily by the U.S., which grew 17% overall. The following are key product line comparisons to Q1 last year. OCC net revenues of $151.2 million were up roughly $17.2 million and 13%. Net revenues from OCC products had good growth in the Americas, but were relatively flat in the rest of the world. UC was the major driver of OCC growth, up roughly $14 million and 51% over Q1 of the prior year with strong double-digit growth in both the Americas and our Europe and Africa region. Revenue from core OCC products also grew by about 3% on strength in our CS500 family of products. Net revenues from Mobile products were up roughly $5 million and 15% compared to a year ago. This makes Mobile revenues roughly 20% of our total revenues, consistent with Q1 of last year. Mobile revenues were down as we expected from the peak in Q4 when we saw significant benefit from China's hands-free law, and we expect the current sales rate in China to be similar to this level going forward. Non-GAAP gross margins was down 170 basis points compared to Q1 of the prior year. Product mix was a significant factor, as I discussed earlier. In the June quarter, UC was 28% of total OCC, up from 21% in Q1 of last year. In addition to the mix change, we recorded approximately $1.8 million in excess and obsolete inventory this quarter, which is significantly higher than what we recorded in Q1 of the prior year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $64.2 million in the first quarter, up $2.7 million or 4% versus the prior Q1 and dropping from 33.9% of net revenues a year ago to 31.7% in the quarter just ended. The major drivers of the $2.7 million increase were headcount associated with R&D investments and the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities around the world. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 20.9%, 60 basis points higher than in Q1 last year on lower gross margins. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 27%. As a result of all of these items, our Q1 non-GAAP net income of $30.6 million was 14% higher than a year ago, yielding non-GAAP EPS of $0.70, up $0.07 from last year's Q1 results. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights. We finished the quarter with $444 million in cash and investments on our balance sheet and generated over $34 million in cash flow from operations during that period. Of the $444 million in cash and investments at quarter end, $41 million was domestic. DSO was flat at 54 days compared to Q1 of the prior year. Net inventories were up $6.4 million versus a year ago and down about $2 million from March at $65.3 million. Inventory turns were up to 6.0 compared to 5.7 in Q1 of last year. Turning to our capital expenditures. Our Q1 investment was $13 million or 6.4% of net revenues. Approximately half of that investment relates to our new building in Tijuana, Mexico. Depreciation expense on a GAAP basis for Q1 was $4 million and was only slightly higher than in the first quarter of last year. During July, we completed the move of our manufacturing operations into the new building, and I'm happy to say it was a smooth process with no impact to our customers. Turning to the outlook. There continues to be mixed economic news. The economic environment remains uncertain in Europe while the tone in the U.S. is cautiously optimistic. Our second quarter is typically characterized by a slow start with low bookings in July and early August with an expected pickup by September, when people return from summer vacations. As a result, we typically experience a small seasonal decline in Q2 compared to Q1. Although we remain very optimistic for the full fiscal year and beyond and we continue to see UC adoption grow, typical seasonality, in addition to the handful of large transactions we booked in the first quarter that are not likely to recur in Q2, are resulting in the expectation of a new decrease in Q2 from Q1. We believe total net revenues for our second fiscal quarter ending in September will be in the range of $192 million to $200 million. This forecast assumes similar growth margins as we experienced this quarter. Depending on revenue mix and other factors, we believe non-GAAP operating income will be approximately $36 million to $40 million. Based on all the above, we currently expect non-GAAP EPS to be $0.62 to $0.68 on average diluted share outstanding of approximately 44.1 million. The GAAP reconciling items we expect in the coming quarter include approximately $7 million in stock-based comp expense, accelerate depreciation, early exit lease termination charges and amortization of purchased intangible assets. Therefore, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.51 to $0.57 for the September quarter. With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator for the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question come from the line of Dave King with Roth Capital. David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : I guess first off, just on the gross margin. Pam, in some of your comments -- I'm not sure if I heard it correctly. Did you say there was a write-off of obsolete inventory in the quarter? And maybe -- and I think you said it was higher than last year. Maybe -- can you quantify to what extent that weighed on the gross margin this quarter, if at all? Pamela J. Strayer: Yes. I think -- so the write-off was $1.8 million this quarter. And in the prior year, I don't remember exactly, but it was below $500,000. So it was pretty low. David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : Okay, okay, that helps then. And then in terms of the Mexico facility, it sounds like you completed that move in July. How should we think about that benefiting you guys on the cost front going forward? When should start to take hold, and what do you guys think in terms of potential cost savings there from doing so? Pamela J. Strayer: Yes. So in the past, we have estimated an annualized savings of a couple of million, $2 million to $3 million, and that's still a good estimate. I wouldn't expect to see the savings of that for a full quarter until Q4. We're still consolidating some of the buildings. We still have some operating expenses for multiple buildings. So -- and we're still installing solar panels. So that's going to take a little while. We'll see about that. David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : That helps. And then, Ken, maybe -- or Pam, the -- just more of a general question kind of away from UC. Just to -- I don't know if we've focused on this as much recently. But just in terms of the Gaming business and the Clarity business, can you guys talk about some of the initiatives you guys have there? Maybe talk about some of the -- I think there was a revenue decline in the Clarity business, for example, this quarter. Maybe just talk, generally, about how you guys are thinking about those businesses in the overall scheme of things at this point? And what, if any, investments you're making there at all and just how you think about the prioritization versus some of your other businesses? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Sure. First, let me just hit the Clarity business very quickly. Of course, it's been very hard hit because it is a business that, although it serves a very favorable demographic market, which are people with hearing impairments and with the aging of society, it's basically a growing demographic. The -- many of the products are distributed for free by state programs, and that funding has been clearly severely impacted. And then particularly, a couple of the programs, they also did some restructuring some of their business activities that bit -- created a bit of a hold in the market. We've come out with some great product innovations there though, that are very exciting in terms of taking advantage of some of the new platforms that are available for people on tablets and other technologies. So we feel very, very good about the business and its long-term demographic appeal, even though it is going through a rough patch at the moment. And we continue to be the leaders in that market, although the market is certainly depressed for now. But we do view it as one with good, profitable, long-term growth potential. Relative to the gaming market, we are very, very pleased with the position that we're in. We had a partnership with the League of Legends people. We've got some new products that we're getting ready to launch. We see there's a market that has got excellent growth potential and one that is -- at the end of the day, for the high-performance gamer, they're interested in winning, and we can provide the best products. And therefore, we think that we have some tremendous strategic fits with that market. I don't want to kid you, our priority remains UC, and after that, it remains OCC. But having said that, we think we have enough room to fund these and to sustain these investments as well. Operator : And your next question come from the line of Greg Burns with Sidoti & Company. Gregory Burns - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Just another question about the gross margin. I guess, Pam, you mentioned the mix of UC impacting the gross margin. But within UC, what are you seeing? I know historically, you've talked about seeing higher gross margins than you would expect over the long term. Can you just give us some more color on what's going on within UC itself in terms of the gross margins you're seeing? Pamela J. Strayer: Sure. So in -- within UC, our ASPs and our gross margins are holding up very well. We haven't seen any significant changes there at all. And consistent with what we've said, our long-term model assumes UC becomes a larger portion, and the 50% to 52% is what our UC products will support. So our standard margins or our product margins there, we're not forecasting for those to change dramatically. It's just going to be a larger portion of our total revenue. Gregory Burns - Sidoti & Company, LLC: Okay. And with the -- I guess a few larger than expected orders hitting this quarter in OCC. At least, by my model, it's looks like the Mobile segment came in a little under what we were looking for. Now did the China fall off a little more than expected? Could you just give us any color on what's happening in China? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Actually, we weren't 100% sure what to expect in China. The fact is that what we have experienced with hands-free laws, we did not have experience in a country of the nature of China, and we were not sure the degree to which, in a slightly less developed country, we would see -- how we would see the pattern of revenues. In fact, it wound up following the developed country model. And so actually, it was very close to what we have actually expected would occur in China. But we weren't 100% confident with the forecast we have. Operator : And your next question come from the line of Mike Latimore with Northland Capital. Michael Latimore - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : The -- did you comment on, generally, what you expect the Mobile business to do in the September quarter? I thought you said something, but I might have missed that. Just from a general kind of sequential trend. Pamela J. Strayer: Yes. So we don't provide forecast at that level, by product category. But generally, I think what I had said -- what I was talking about was seasonality overall in total revenues, in that we typically see some decrease in revenues from Q1 to Q2. And I think Mobile follows that seasonality as well. Michael Latimore - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. And then are you seeing either in -- actually, in Europe, in particular, but maybe U.S. as well, just kind of a refresh cycle in some of the traditional product areas? Meaning, just employees being allowed to buy, upgrade traditional headsets, non-UC? S. Kenneth Kannappan : We had a little bit of that helping us and, as we said in the last quarter, where there was a little bit of pent-up demand and some budgets allowed people to do that. I think that having said that, in general, that business remains more steady than volatile. Michael Latimore - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : I got it. And then any view as to the federal budget sequester impact or furloughs? How do you view that impacting, particularly, the U.S. market, I guess? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Sure. We still think that's something to worry about. But having said that, we don't actually believe at this point in time, it's likely to affect our September quarter. It seems at this point in time, we're only less than 2 months that are left, that very little is really likely to have an impact. But I think beyond that point in time, there's still a significant risk that the sequester will affect some of the defense prime contractors, as well as some federal government expenditures. Michael Latimore - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : And just last, the -- how many salespeople are you adding this fiscal year? Pamela J. Strayer: Well, we're adding sales headcount globally. I don't have the exact number in front of me. We'd get back to you on that. Greg Klaben : It did -- it's also dependent on revenue growth. We did highlight in the call that we're targeting that target operating margin range of 20%, 23%. So it's somewhat dependent on that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Toomey with Raymond James. Daniel Toomey : Most of it has been covered so far, but I guess if you could just give a little more color on the large onetime orders and if you have any sort of visibility on any of those in future quarters. S. Kenneth Kannappan : Sure. We always get a certain amount of onetime deals, and it was just a quarter that was a little bit stronger, in that, again, I think there was a little bit of pent-up demand. It wasn't all end market orders. It was also some that was just timing from the standpoint of the channel, not that the channel inventories were up, but just there was a little bit there. So between the 2 of it, it just wound up being a quarter that was a little bit better than normal from the standpoint of larger types of buys. Daniel Toomey : Okay. And as far as your guidance goes, is next quarter's operating expenses going to be roughly in line with the current -- recent quarter, or are there any changes going on there? Pamela J. Strayer: There will be an uptick in operating expenses that's built into our guidance. There's a couple of things going on there. We continue to invest heavily in sales and marketing, but Q2 is also our first quarter where we've got full quarter of merit salary increases for our staff. So there's items like that that's going to increase OpEx. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Rohit Chopra with Wedbush. Rohit N. Chopra - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : Ken, I hope you're going to be well soon. I had 3 questions. I just want to come back to large deals. We -- I know you didn't mention this, but are these related to the new Microsoft Lync released in first quarter? Anything coming out of that? Any growth? S. Kenneth Kannappan : No. Actually, related to other things. And one of them related to a product that we launched, and there was some pent-up demand for that. Some of it just related, as I said, I think to some pent-up upgrades, actually, some of that being, again, in the core OCC legacy, things where people got budgets and just went ahead with existing upgrades. We obviously had a good quarter for UC, but that's not as much of the -- at some of the large deals, but it's not as much as the change in the large deals. Rohit N. Chopra - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : Right. And so is Lync becoming a contributor? Do you see that in your pipeline with the new... S. Kenneth Kannappan : Absolutely. Lync has been a big contributor in the UC growth. It's been a big contributor. But we were talking about the change in the large deal part. Rohit N. Chopra - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : Yes. And then there was something else you mentioned, and you talked about wearable technology. And I know you guys put out a press release on this, but it's been something big. Should we think about the company strategically moving into or further into that direction related to, say, biometrics, where you would compete with, say, Fitbit, Jawbone, Nike. Is that an area that you're looking to get into? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Well, it depends how you phrase it. Yes, we absolutely believe that biometric is -- can be part of the information that we intelligently provide. Is the goal to compete with Fitbit or Nike? Not necessarily. Perhaps we would look at it as being something where we should be complementary to the things that people want to have and the things that we can provide. Rohit N. Chopra - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : okay. My last question, Pam, this just comes back to you. I know you don't do this by category, but I'm just trying to get the implication here with the guidance. Does that mean that UC is actually flat, or do you still expect UC to grow sequentially next quarter? Pamela J. Strayer: Yes. Well, that's hard to say. let's say even worst case, if UC was flat, it would still represent 40% year-over-year growth rate for the quarter. So not a bad result. But yes, it's hard to know how the revenues are going to fall between our different product category. Operator : And your final question come from the line of Josh Goldberg with G2 Investment Partners. Josh Goldberg - G2 Investment Partners Management LLC : Ken, glad you're feeling better. Just a couple of quick questions. First, I guess, as you go back almost 3 or 4 quarters now, you've been near the high end of your original guidance range. This quarter, you came in more in the middle of the range. Can you just tell me, kind of in terms of the puts and takes, what came in sort of less than what you expected? It sounds like UC was better. Where kind of did you see some pockets of weakness? And I have a follow-up. S. Kenneth Kannappan : Well, first of all, it's -- probably seems to you like we have a really wide target. To us, it seems like a really narrow target, where it's $7 million and we're predicting pretty far in advance. And $203 million or something like that when the range was $198 million to $205 million, to us, it's really pretty close there. We certainly had potential in the higher numbers that we would see less falloffs in the China number for Mobile, because we weren't really sure what kind of pattern we would see with that. But there are other variables, too. Certain regions, globally, India and Japan have gotten a little bit weaker. There's been some volatility. But having said that, again, there's also been strong areas. So to me, that variation is pretty small for us predicting it, at least, in our minds, for a quarter result. Josh Goldberg - G2 Investment Partners Management LLC : Okay. And then just to follow up. I mean, obviously, without the inventory reserve in your gross margin, your gross margins moving closer to 53%, a little over 53% and you're guiding next quarter to be roughly the same number on gross margin percentage. I'm just wondering why that would be the case with, obviously, Mobile being lower again this following quarter. Your higher-margin businesses should be a bigger part of the mix. What -- where are we missing that would cause your margins to be roughly in line with this quarter, with the inventory being less of an issue and Mobile being less of an issue? Pamela J. Strayer: Well, I am including a conservative estimate in there for more E&O charges going forward. As our -- as we continue to innovate in our products and our product life cycle shorten, forecasting that demand and managing those product transitions are becoming very challenging for us. It's an area that we're working on. But I just included conservative E&O numbers there. So overall, it's -- and by product mix, I mean, it's hard to know. Our gross margins change a lot based on what our product mix comes in at. But it's primarily E&O for next quarter. Josh Goldberg - G2 Investment Partners Management LLC : Can you give us a rough sense of how much you're expecting that to be next quarter? So that way, we realize how much it's going to affect you. I mean, you called out a $1.8 million this quarter. Pamela J. Strayer: Yes. I don't think I'd want to try and guess at that number. I don't -- yes, I don't want to forecast. I don't make a habit to forecast that number. Josh Goldberg - G2 Investment Partners Management LLC : Okay. And in terms of the tax rate, is it still going to stay around 27%? Pamela J. Strayer: Yes. That's our current estimate for the full year. Josh Goldberg - G2 Investment Partners Management LLC : I guess the last question -- obviously, your cash balance continues to grow nicely, over $100 million in the last four quarters. Can you give -- I know you bought back some stock this quarter. Can you give us any other color on your cash balance at this point? Pamela J. Strayer: Yes. So we are continuing to repurchase shares with that cash. And in the last quarter, we repurchased over 300,000 shares and spent $11 million on share repurchases. And we'll continue a similar approach going forward, as well as returning cash to shareholders through our dividend, which we've been doing for some time now. Operator : We now have a follow-up question from the line of David King. David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : Actually, my follow-ups just got asked and answered on gross margin and cash. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. Greg Klaben : Okay. Thanks very much for joining us, everyone. And if you have any follow-up questions, you can reach Pam and myself after today's call. S. Kenneth Kannappan : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Strayer - Acting Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President Analysts : John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Michael Latimore - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division Rohit N. Chopra - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Candice, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter fiscal year 2014 conference call. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Greg Klaben, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Greg Klaben : Thank you, Candice. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Plantronics' financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. Joining me today are Ken Kannappan, Plantronics' President and CEO; and Pam Strayer, Plantronics' Senior Vice President and CFO. The information presented and discussed today includes forward-looking statements which are made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The risks and uncertainties related to such statements are detailed in our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and today's press release. For the remainder of today's call, we will be providing only non-GAAP metrics related to gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and EPS. We've reconciled these measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly Analyst Metric Sheet, both of which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Additionally, after the conclusion of today's call, the recording of the call will be available with information on our website as well. Unless stated otherwise, all comparisons of the second quarter fiscal year 2014 financial results are to the same quarter and the prior year. Plantronics' second quarter revenues were $194 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.53 compared with $0.61 in the same quarter of the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.64 compared with $0.70 in the prior year quarter. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS consist of charges for stock-based compensation, early exit lease termination, accelerated depreciation, amortization of purchased intangible assets and restructuring and other related charges, all net of the associated tax impact as well as the tax benefits from the expiration of certain statutes of limitations and other tax benefits that are not reflective of our ongoing operations. Please refer to the full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP in our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. S. Kenneth Kannappan : Thank you, Greg. First, I'd like to provide an update on my medical status. My leave of absence has ended and I'm very pleased to return as President and CEO. My doctors believe that the cancer, for which I took my medical leave in April, has been successfully treated. I'd like to thank everyone for their support during my leave. In particular, I would like to thank Pam Strayer for assumption of additional responsibilities as acting CEO and her excellence in carrying out those duties over the past period. I'd also like to thank the entire management team at Plantronics and all of our associates for furthering our progress on our UC strategy and corporate goals. I'm on the path to complete recovery and look forward to seeing you at investor conferences when I resume a normal travel schedule. We achieved revenue and earnings just below the midpoint of our guidance, with year-over-year revenue growth in the U.S., Europe, in Africa and Asia Pacific regions. Office & Contact Center revenues grew by 5% with core OCC revenue being flat year-over-year. As expected, core OCC was down sequentially due, at least partially, to the timing of deals in the June quarter. Voluntary job turnover, the key driver of headset replacement sales, remain sluggish, still down about 20% from prerecession levels. UC revenues grew by 22% year-over-year, with growth in every geography. Revenues were down sequentially for the first time and down in every geography sequentially. See outline in last quarter's conference call, we believe this is primarily due to the timing of UC deals. Our year-to-date UC revenues are up 36%, and this growth is in line with our long-term expectations for the market. In the past, we've emphasized that the quarterly forecasting of UC is challenging and that we may experience volatility. Our third quarter UC revenues are off to a solid start and the long-term fundamentals behind the UC opportunity remain as strong as ever. Our position in the UC market remains excellent and we continue to believe we are widely recognized as the leader in market share and innovation. In the Mobile product group, revenues were up 28% year-over-year through a combination of market share gains in the U.S. and abroad in mono Bluetooth and positive market acceptance of our new stereo Bluetooth headset, the BackBeat GO 2, which showed revenue growth in stereo of over 50%. We've introduced several innovative products recently. For the office, we introduced the Voyager Legend CS, building on our popular Legend headset platform with a new base to connect the Bluetooth Legend headset to your office desk phone, while also providing connectivity to your mobile and computer. It has all the features of the Voyager Legend, including advanced sensors, voice commands and superior sound quality. It intuitively directs calls to your phone or headset and allows you to automatically answer calls by placing the headset on your ear. We also introduced the CS500, a wireless office headset for high-density headset environments. Which allows approximately 3x the number of headsets be used in a small area. In the gaming area, we introduced and recently started shipping the RIG headset, the first gaming headset designed with mobile connectivity in mind, utilizing the mixture to combine gaming with music and mobile communications and the versatility of the game on PC, Mac, Xbox 360, PS3s, smartphones and tablets. Given that we are now halfway through our fiscal year, I'd like to provide an update on our goals for fiscal year 2014 : first, deliver profitable growth; second, extend our brand; third, expand our consumer reach; fourth, optimize the culture; and fifth, scale for growth. Delivering profitable growth is one of our top priorities as we aim for the right balance between investing for the future and maintaining a high level of profitability and cash flow generation. In Q2, our operating margins were slightly below our long-term target range of 20% to 23%, although we are on track for the first half of fiscal year. We do expect operating margin to be below 20% in the third quarter due partially to mix in gross margin, investments we expect to pay off in growth over the next year and increased legal expenses related to litigation with GN. We've indicated we don't intend to let these legal expenses reduce our investment in the business, and we expect these expenses will primarily occur during the next 4 quarters. We continue to believe that our long-term model is correct and achievable. For the full fiscal year, we expect to be close to the range for operating margins excluding litigation expenses. Our second goal is to extend our brand association among consumers. We're undertaking new digital marketing initiatives, channel marketing programs and, as I've discussed in the past, we made investments in wearable technology and contextual intelligence that are increasing the value and relevance of our brand. Our website will be relaunched shortly to provide a better experience for enterprise and consumer customers. We made good progress on our third goal, improving consumer reach. Bluetooth market share in the U.S. has improved throughout the year. We've also grown our share internationally. Our expansion of share of Bluetooth category has proved successful in the BackBeat GO 2 launch and our new gaming portfolio is generating rave reviews. In addition, our innovations team is making good progress with incorporating advanced sensors and tracking into our products for greater consumer appeal. Our fourth goal relates to scaling for growth. In the first half this year, we've invested in a new more efficient manufacturing plant in Mexico, going online in August. We anticipate being at the full annualized savings rate of $2 million to $3 million beginning next fiscal year. We're on track with our Oracle R12 implementation which will allow us to simplify our processes, saving time and money, invest in our workplace and associates including greater investment in training and performance tracking. Finally, last quarter, I covered how we've been working to optimize the Plantronics culture and make it a great place to work and attract talent, combined with making institutional changes to support faster growth and increased innovation. On behalf of everyone at Plantronics, we want to thank you for your continued support. And I'd like to now turn the call over to Pam to discuss the second quarter results in more detail. Pamela J. Strayer: Thanks, Ken. I'll start with an overview of the quarter before getting into more detail. We achieved our revenue and earnings guidance for the quarter, although both were towards the lower end of our range. Second quarter net revenues were $194 million, representing 8% growth over the prior year. Non-GAAP operating income of $38 million is a decline of 5% compared to Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.64 is $0.06 lower than the prior year, a decrease of 9%. As we discussed last quarter when provided guidance for Q2, our second fiscal quarter is typically a seasonally low quarter. Summer holidays result in a slow July and August. We typically see a strong pickup in bookings in early September, but the timing of that pickup can vary and have a large effect on our results for the quarter. This September quarter was the most back-end loaded we have seen in 3 years. The good news is that we did see a strong pickup entering the December quarter, but several metrics for Q2, including DSOs and cash flows from operations, were negatively impacted as a result. Now, I'll cover revenue in more detail. Total net revenues for the second quarter of $194 million were up $14.7 million or 8% compared to the second quarter last year. All of our regions experienced growth. The U.S. grew 8%, E&A grew 11% and Asia Pac grew 17% over the prior year. The following are key product line comparisons to Q2 last year. OCC net revenues of $140 million were up roughly $7 million and 5%. Net revenues from OCC products grew in all regions of the world. UC was the driver for that growth while core OCC was generally flat compared to the prior year. UC was up roughly $6.8 million or 22% over Q2 of the prior year, with strong double-digit growth in all regions of the world. Net revenues for mobile products were up $9.4 million and 28% compared to a year ago. This growth increased mobile revenues to roughly 22% of our total revenues compared to 19% in Q2 of the prior year. Our growth in mobile products was driven primarily by sales of our Voyager Legend and our Backbeat GO product. During the second quarter, we launch our new Backbeat GO 2 and the sales are outpacing the sales of the Backbeat GO 1 in the first full quarter of shipping. Non-GAAP gross margins were 52.3% this quarter, down from 54.7% in the Q2 of the prior year. Product mix was the primary reason for the decrease and accounted for a gross margin decline of approximately 130 basis points. As mentioned earlier, mobile revenues as a percentage of total increased to 22% from 19% last year. UC revenues as a percentage of OCC revenues increased to 26%, up from 23% in the prior year. In addition to product mix, higher E&O expense accounted for a decrease of 40 basis points, and increased freight out charges accounted for a decline of 30 basis points compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $63 million, up $5 million or 9% versus the prior Q2. The major drivers of the increase were $3 million related to higher headcount and annual merit increases. In addition, we spent an additional $2 million for product launches in the quarter which increased our marketing expense compared to the prior year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 19.6%, down from 22.3% in the prior year. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 27%. As a result of all these items, our Q2 non-GAAP net income of $28 million was 6% lower than a year ago, yielding non-GAAP EPS of $0.64, down $0.06 from last year's Q2 results and in line with our guidance. Now turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with $439 million in cash and investments on our balance sheet and generated over $23 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter. Of the $439 million in cash and investments at quarter-end, $40 million was domestic. We used $16.5 million to repurchase shares during the quarter. DSO was up 57 -- was 57 days, up from 54 days at the end of Q2 in the prior year. The increase was due primarily to the higher bookings in the third month of the quarter than in the prior year. These bookings are due after the end of Q2 and, therefore, we end up with a higher percentage of our quarterly revenue still in accounts receivable at the end of Q2. Net inventories were up $7.5 million versus a year ago. Inventory turns are up to 5.5 compared to 5.3 in Q2 of last year. Turning to our capital expenditures. Our Q2 investment was $14.2 million or 7.3% of net revenues. Approximately half of that investment relates to the completion of the building construction and furniture and equipment for our new manufacturing facility in Tijuana, Mexico. Depreciation expense on a GAAP basis for Q2 was $3.7 million and was down from $4 million in the second quarter last year. We're forecasting to spend $16.5 million in capital expenditures next quarter and $5 million for the fourth fiscal quarter for an annual total of roughly $50 million in the full fiscal year 2014. Turning to the outlook. Our third fiscal quarter is typically the strongest quarter for our mobile product due to the holiday season, therefore, we expect our percentage of revenues for mobile products to increase and our gross margins for the quarter to be down from Q2 levels. In addition, after a down sequential quarter for UC, we expect the third quarter to return to a more typical growth pattern for revenues from UC products. We believe total net revenues for the third fiscal quarter ending in December will be in the range of $202 million to $210 million. This forecast assumes gross margins to be closer to the low end of our long-term range of 50% to 52%, primarily due to a higher percentage of revenue coming from mobile products. And while we don't know if there will be one, we are conservatively including in our guidance the possibility of an E&O charge of approximately $1 million. Between our revenue mix and other factors, we believe our non-GAAP operating income will be approximately $36 million to $39 million. This results in an operating margin which is below our long-term targeted range. If you compare our forecasted operating margin in Q3 to this latest second quarter operating margin of 19.6%, approximately 3/4 of the decrease quarter-over-quarter is related to the decline in gross margin due to seasonal mix and conservative forecast for E&O. Approximately 1/4 of this decline is related to litigation expenses from the GN lawsuit. Our guidance expects that we will spend a little over $1 million on this lawsuit in Q3. As a reminder, we are including GN litigation costs as part of our non-GAAP results based on our policies for non-GAAP reporting. The GN lawsuit has recently entered the discovery phase and the impact to operating income from the associated legal expenses is particularly difficult to forecast. Actual expenses can vary significantly from our forecast. Non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 27%. Based on all the above, we currently expect non-GAAP EPS to be $0.60 to $0.65 per share on average diluted share outstanding of approximately 43.8 million. The GAAP-reconciling items we expect in the third quarter include approximately $6 million in stock-based compensation expense and purchase accounting amortization net of associated tax. Therefore, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.50 to $0.55 per share for the December quarter. With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from John Bright with Avondale Partners. John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : Ken, welcome back. The UC revenues this quarter, down. It feels like it was a timing issue not only in the June quarter -- not only from the strong June results but also maybe some slipped out into the December quarter. Does that sound about right? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Yes. I think that there -- we had a number of large deals. Some of them were OCC rather than UC that hit in the June quarter, and we pretty much had expected we would have a bit of a dip into the September quarter based on what we knew of the likely timing. A number of the large UC deals in our minds remain very much on track. They're not all necessarily going to all hit in December, but some of them do begin, or at least are scheduled to begin in the December quarter. John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : Can you give us an update on the competitive dynamics within the UC market? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Sure. I mean, I don't know if you want to narrow the question, but I guess, from my perspective, what we're continuing to see is that -- in terms of the providers, that Cisco and Microsoft continue to aggressively pursue the market with a good deal of success. We're believing that, frankly, we are very much recognized as the leading player in our part of the business not just in terms of market share, but in terms of innovation, in terms of support, in terms of thought leadership. And we're -- we feel very, very good about that position and how we've been strengthening it. John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : Ken, when you mentioned your FY '14 updated goals, the third one, expand the consumer reach, I think, is what you said, or customer consumer reach. As I look forward to FY '15, you're going to have some capital allocation decisions, I think, because you're probably going to build up a bit of cash. This quarter, you, I think, completed the plant in Tijuana. You've done the work in Santa Cruz. So from a CapEx standpoint, I don't think there's any major projects out there, correct me if I'm wrong. Is M&A still something that is really unlikely, it's more just something that was compelling and very opportunistic? Is that how we should think about that within capital allocation? S. Kenneth Kannappan : So our -- just to separate for a second because the plant in Plamex actually did not use domestic cash, okay, which -- and we're not able to return the international cash effectively to our shareholders at this point in time. Of course, we're hoping for a tax holiday, but right now, that's the case. So with our domestic cash, we do attempt to return roughly 1/3 of it in the form of dividends and 2/3 of it in the form of share repurchases, more when the stock is lower, less when it's high, and then we accumulate a little bit more. We have not found many acquisitions that were material, and we're not aware of any that we think are appropriate. Now it's not a kind of question I'm going to answer all the time because you never know when something to your point could pop up. But in general, most of the plans that we have seem to be obtainable through organic growth. If something comes along that is a really good fit and made a lot of sense, either because we couldn't do it internally or because it was a product that really fit our portfolio and our distribution channels and we thought we can successfully sustain it, than we might do it. But that has not been our primary orientation. John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : Final question for Pam. Pam you talked about the legal expense over the next 4 quarters. Difficult to measure -- and maybe I missed it, did you break it out for this current quarter? Pamela J. Strayer: We didn't have significant expenses related to GN in Q2, if that's what you mean by this quarter. For Q3, our guidance includes a little over $1 million for GN. I don't have -- no. John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : Is that something -- and should we think about that, $1 million each over the next 4 quarters, best guess? Pamela J. Strayer: Yes. I mean, I don't -- it's really going to be tough to know. So we don't have really have guidance on that. Operator : And your next question comes from Dave King with Roth. David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : I guess in terms of your revenue guidance and kind of thinking about some of your other businesses beyond UC, it sounds like UC, you do expect some -- a little bit of re-acceleration there. But maybe looking at kind of core OCC -- Ken you talked about there've been timing of deals there as well, I think last quarter or seen this quarter, you got -- you were hit by that, cascaded last quarter. I mean, how should we think about that? Should there be a re-acceleration there as well? And then as we think about mobile, I understand that, obviously, it's higher seasonally, but -- or could it be stronger seasonally, but how are you thinking about it from a year-over-year standpoint, maybe? Just any color you guys can provide on -- along those lines would be helpful. S. Kenneth Kannappan : Sure, I'll try to do that. First, yes, we do think that we have a great secular growth trend with UC and, even though there's some volatility, we expect that to continue. Relative to core OCC, I would look at this as being largely tied to economic conditions. And the single most important economic condition is the robustness of voluntary turnover. When the employment markets are robust, people are confident, more willing to take risk, more willing to leave, secure jobs where they know people and go elsewhere. When their housing markets are more robust, they are more willing to relocate. And those things all feed into voluntary turnover. As I mentioned in the call, the reality is we haven't seen yet that rebound in voluntary turnover which you would normally expect, frankly, a couple of years back. And so, a lot of the UC growth has been offset by this continued weakness in the OCC markets. Now if we start to see a more robust broad-based recovery, we absolutely would expect that. Do we expect it right away? Not really. I mean, we had a little bit of a lift in the June quarter, but it's been -- it's a little bit flattish right now. I think there's been a lot of headline concerns still about economies around the globe and some uncertainties around the U.S. economy. So what we would hope for, really, in the absence of better GDP growth is fairly slow growth in the OCC market rather than something that's really robust. If in a better economic environment, then we would hope to see some better growth in that business. Relative to the mobile business, the -- there's been a couple of things that had driven the business, one has been new hands-free laws. And although there have been some, the most recent large one being China, we're not aware of anything large coming up. Illinois is coming up, but the truth is that Chicago already had a hands-free law, so it's a much smaller lift that we expect than if we had the whole state, including Chicago, suddenly coming online. The Bluetooth stereo market is absolutely growing and we are intending to participate in that. And then the gaming market is also growing and we do intend to participate in that. So I don't know if that's helpful and responsive. If not, let me know if there's a further question. David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : No, sir. That's helpful. I mean, I guess, in terms of on the core OCC side, it sounds like it's going to remain challenging due to the macro. I guess it just -- had shown some signs of improvement for a couple of quarters there, and so it sounds like maybe it's not going to necessarily improve all that much until we really see a more robust recovery, so... S. Kenneth Kannappan : Yes. Part of that was some institutions, some of the financials had bought earlier, they'd kind of gotten their balance sheets in place, they're a little bit bitter able to recover. But the broad-based kind of upswing, we haven't seen them in this. More recently, we've seen a little bit of upturn in the U.K. but again, it's just not been a full global recovery. David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then one other question related to kind of the expense guidance and, I guess, operating income guidance, is a better way of saying it. In terms of -- I think, Pam, you laid it out as being 3 quarters related to gross margin, back-end gross margin, and some of that's happening in 1 quarter litigation, if I heard that correctly. I guess , can you just help us out in understanding how much of it's investments in the business and where -- future investments in the business? And so, where -- how to think about that and where you're allocating those investments in terms of people or R&D and some of those things and kind of a run rate as we look out even further to the next quarter, what to kind of expect. Pamela J. Strayer: Sure. Yes. Well, one of the challenges with providing more details on the guidance is that we are providing a range. We are going to be investing in more sales and marketing to take -- to cover GO expansion and continue to invest in the UC opportunities. So there are those investments in there for the quarter. As you know, we're making those investments ahead of any revenue payoffs for them, so we expect that those will return over the next year or so. But because it is a range that we're providing, it depends on the timing of when the headcount comes on, when we can hire people, that type of thing. So I didn't really highlight it necessarily, but the plan doesn't include that investment there. Operator : And your next question comes from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : A couple of questions, Pam, and then I want to dig into the mobile business, a little bit, Ken. First on the CapEx, I want to make sure I heard you right, was the $5 million number for the fiscal fourth quarter? And is that a kind of reasonable quarterly run rate now that kind of the big capital spending is done or are there other you would expect to do in the near future in terms of CapEx? Pamela J. Strayer: Yes. So the $5 million was for the fiscal fourth quarter. And I think prior to the Plamex building investment and some of the other facilities investments that we're making here at Santa Cruz, our CapEx run rate per quarter was somewhere in the range of $5 million to $10 million a quarter, so that's how I would think about it going forward. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Great. And the $2 million to $3 million in savings, that's an annual number? Pamela J. Strayer: It is an annual number. And the challenge with that is a big part of that savings is going to be coming from our solar installation and the savings we're going to be getting using solar, which is going to be much higher in the summertime. So it's tough right now to predict exactly when that would fall, but it is an annual number. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then, Ken, the mobile business that -- you've had, obviously, for a number of reasons, a good couple of quarters year-over-year. So as I think about seasonality in the December quarter, should we think about sequentially a similar seasonal ramp as you guys have seen in the past or is the September quarter, we're coming off kind of so strong that maybe not quite as much seasonality? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Yes, I think it will probably mute a little bit the typical seasonal lift. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : And when you talk about -- I think, in answering another question, you mentioned Bluetooth stereo, I presume you're talking headsets. Did you plans to get into the speaker market again or is that really related to the headset commentary only? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Yes, that was really related to headset commentary only. I mean, it's certainly an adjacent market, but -- so I'm not -- I'm certainly not ruling it out, but I was really referring to headsets. Operator : And your next question comes from Mike Latimore with Northland Capital. Michael Latimore - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : Great, and also, congratulations, Ken. And then, I guess on the -- I'm just thinking about the long-term operating margin of 20% to 23%. I know that you used to invest for growth for a while here. I guess, I mean, as long as there's a pretty big Unified Communications opportunity, I mean, when would you sort of slow investments for growth as long as an opportunity's kind of pronounced? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Yes. I think that -- it's a matter of looking, of course, at the ROIs, at the -- what we need to do to maintain or enhance our competitive position in the market. But the truth is that we are probably at a point where our portfolio is very, very strong relative to that growth, and we are actually beginning to shift a little bit of the investment on the R&D side back towards some other parts of the business. And the -- so the UC investment is, in my mind, pretty full. We're expanding a little bit on the go-to-market side, a little less, as I say, on the development side. And so, I think that after we get done with a couple of things, including this litigation expense that will largely run for 4 quarters or so, we would expect our margins to properly be able to lift back a little bit. Michael Latimore - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. I didn't hear any commentary around sort of the federal government. Did that -- does that have any influence on the September, December quarter kind of activity there? S. Kenneth Kannappan : So when you say any influence, of course, it's possible that it did. But having said that, we do not think that we have a significant impact from the sequestration or the budget issues. The sequestration primarily affects some of the contractors, and a lot of that is not really rippled through to a significant degree, so we might have had a small impact. A lot of the government is still investing, though, in productivity. And so, our category continues to be reasonably favorable. From the budget slowdown and the government shutdown, we probably had a small dip in revenues in the December quarter, but we expect that we'll recover that during the course of the quarter. Michael Latimore - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. And then is the general view is though that the Unified Communication, your Unified Communications business, is on track for the year? And then in -- by your own track, I guess, how would you define that? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Well, so we look at it in terms our performance and that's -- our performance is really relative to the potential, which we don't control. We don't intend to really cause the adoption of the market. We're letting Cisco, Microsoft, the other big UC vendors really spread those solutions. And the pace at which those voice deployments occur is determined by the big companies and we're just trying to follow along, do the best job we can, providing great solutions, capture market share and satisfy our customers and try to make a profit from it as well. So from our perspective, the market is, overall, very much on track. We continue to see very good momentum towards the market. Again, the timing of particular deals is a little bit volatile, but in terms of our market position, in terms of the market, we think it's very on track. Michael Latimore - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : And lastly, the pricing environment. Any comment on the pricing environments for Unified Communications products, maybe Europe versus U.S.? S. Kenneth Kannappan : So overall, we continue to feel that our value proposition is very strong and that's allowing us to maintain margins. So most of the mix effect on our margins is due to a larger portion of UC rev and any deterioration of our UC margins. We certainly find that there's nothing but price out there. I mean every competitor has the same strategy which is, if you're not better, then you're going to be cheaper. And so, we certainly see a lot of price competition out there. But an awful lot of people want their systems to work, too, and so, we continue to be the leader. Operator : And your next question comes from Rohit Chopra with Wedbush. Rohit N. Chopra - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : And Ken, great to have you back. I wanted to ask you about Cisco, if you don't mind. Cisco released a brand-new set of products, I guess, it's a full-on launch that they did last week. Do you think that this has any impact -- or did it have any impact maybe on the timing of the orders that you're talking about? S. Kenneth Kannappan : So I don't actually think so. Don't get me wrong, Cisco is massive and very, very important to our ecosystem and that can affect their orders. But I think that the timing of these rollouts and the replacement cycles for our products are still a little bit independent of that. We're excited by some of these new products. We've got some great integrations with them. It allows us to show some new features. And it's, again, really good stuff. But it's more of a long-term driver that it is affecting, I think, the timing of our orders. Rohit N. Chopra - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : Okay. And I take it you're part of this whole rollout, so you're well aware of what I'm talking about, right? The integration of the new products and you're part of that? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Yes. Rohit N. Chopra - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : Okay. The other piece that I wanted to ask you about on these cancellations or timing of the orders. Is that... S. Kenneth Kannappan : There weren't any cancellations. Rohit N. Chopra - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : Okay. The timing of the orders, is that really related to U.S.-based companies or is that just, globally, you found that was the same everywhere? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Yes, that was a global comment. Now don't get me wrong, it was certainly true in the U.S. and -- but, and some of these deployments are global. Some major companies, some of which were in the U.S., did some large purchases in the June quarter, and that was just their timing and so that happened. Rohit N. Chopra - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then one other question. I just wanted to follow up on a question I asked last quarter and you sort of alluded to pushing a little harder into consumer. If you could provide an update on to wearable technology beyond the Bluetooth headset, what you're doing in that area, that would be very helpful. S. Kenneth Kannappan : Well, so I'm not going to provide a complete snapshot on that point, even though it's a very legitimate question and we are investing some dollars and resources into the area, because we do think it is a very interesting area, but it's premature at this point in time for us to get into that. I will say that a lot of the contextual intelligence that we've developed is of immense value for organizations, but it also depends upon a greater degree of ubiquity and usage that we can currently provide. So many people are excited with the information that we can provide, in our ability to communicate it to systems and what that means for other systems, processes and so forth to be able to leverage that. But if our sensors are only attached to, in a non-UC example, 7% or 10% of people, and even in a UC example, if people are not wearing them all the time, then that information has less value. And so, people are very interested in a lot of the intellectual property that we've developed and a lot of the connection we developed and how can we get those into more ubiquitous platforms. So we are working all the time on increased sensors and other things to -- and interconnections that will add value, which are things that we have talked about, but we're also definitely exploring other areas and showing other technologies that leverage some of that. Rohit N. Chopra - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division : Ken, that was extremely helpful and I appreciate it. If I could ask one quick follow-up on that. Does that mean, from what you're saying, that there's also a potential for licensing opportunities or partnership opportunities with the intellectual property you've developed? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Again, I think it would really be premature on that one also. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we have no further questions at this time. I'm sorry, we do have another question from Dave King with Roth. David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : I guess, just some real quick ones. On the gaming side, in terms of the new product introductions, I guess, just a quick question regarding the console replacement cycle that we have kind of ahead here. What, if any, kind of promotions are you guys planning to do around that, if at all, in terms of new products to kind of play on that? And are you expecting any kind of benefit from this console replacement cycle on the gaming business? I guess that's the first one. S. Kenneth Kannappan : So the gaming area is really a new initiative for us. We haven't -- we've been in the PC gaming area, but we have not been in the console gaming area. And so, this is really more of a new effort for us. We do believe that some of these new platforms will represent an opportunity to potentially work with -- I mean, we're not a part of their launch because we're new to the market, but we do believe that they will represent an opportunity to form partnerships now and be part of these new platforms. And that was part of the reason that the timing was good for us to establish our credentials and then develop these relationships and, ultimately, expand into it. But it's not a near-term promotion with these platforms. David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : Okay, that helps. And then, Pam, in terms of the E&O charges, it sounds like you are expecting a kind of another big one this upcoming quarter and would now have a few quarters of those. Is this something we should kind of be modeling in and thinking about as kind of an ongoing sort of run rate? Is it fair to be thinking about some of these charges as fairly one-time in nature? Any context there, I think, would be helpful. Pamela J. Strayer: Yes. So it's a good question, and one of the things that we're going to be looking at in Q3 is really trying to benchmark excess and obsolete charges, what do -- what should we be expecting as a normal E&O charge. In the past, we had charges ranging from $250,000 a quarter, up to $1 million a quarter. So it's a wide range there. I guess, I'm thinking that, over the long term, annual charges of $2 million to $3 million is probably about where we're going to land, but it's kind of early for me to really be too firm about that. That's just kind of what I'm thinking at this point. David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : No, fair enough. And then lastly, Ken, sort of a big picture question. You talked about your initiatives being delivering profitable growth, one of your key initiatives is delivering profitable growth. Obviously, you do have some of these charges, like the E&O charges, like some of the litigation stuff. But even if I back some of that out, it looks like net income has kind of been not necessarily growing at the same pace as revenue. I guess, how should we be thinking about it -- or I guess, how do you think about it when you say delivering profitable growth? Is that something in terms of on a net income line and sort of long-term kind of growth rate, where you expect to be? Obviously, there's different impacts when you get to earnings per share just given your stock options and things of that nature. But just how should we be thinking about that when you talk about that as being a key initiative? S. Kenneth Kannappan : So I mean, partly, you make that kind of initiative because you think you need to do so, obviously, and we were expecting that we would probably have a little bit of downward pressure this year. But as I said, I think we'll still be holding close to that 20% x litigation this year. And then, as I say it, after a few things get done including some of those litigation expenses, then we would expect it to be heading back. In some of the initiatives, I didn't go through all of them because they're not complete, that we're working on them, and some of those will occur next year. We think we'll substantially improve our business efficiency and reduce our cost, increase our speed. And those are things we also think will enhance profitability. So what I would like you to take out of it is that we feel very good about our operating model. I think that, that margin structure is right and, to the extent that we deviate slightly, intend to make those periods of time modest in duration at best and then get back into our target range Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to our presenters. Greg Klaben : Great. Thanks, everyone for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, we'll be available afterwards. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Sharon, and I will be your Conference Operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 FY14 conference call. (Operator Instructions) Mr. Greg Klaben, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Greg Klaben :  Thanks, Sharon, and welcome everyone to Plantronics' third quarter FY14 conference call. Joining me today are Ken Kannappan, Plantronics President and CEO, and Pam Strayer, Plantronics Senior Vice President and CFO. Information presented and discussed today includes forward-looking statements which are made under the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The risks and uncertainties related to such statements are detailed in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K in today's press release. For the remainder of today's call, we'll be providing only non-GAAP metrics related to gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and earnings per share. We have reconciled these measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly analyst metric sheet, both of which are available on the investor relations page of our website. Additionally, after the conclusion of today's call, the recording of the call will be available with the information on our website. Unless stated otherwise, all comparisons of the third quarter FY14 financial results are [to] the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Plantronics third quarter of FY14 net revenues were $212.7 million. Plantronics GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter -- third fiscal quarter was $0.80 compared with $0.66 in FY13. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.76 compared with $0.73 in FY13. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter consists of charges for stock-based compensation and purchase accounting amortization, both net of the associated tax impact and tax benefits with the release of tax reserves, transfer pricing, tax deduction and tax credit adjustments and the impact of tax law changes. Please refer to the full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP in our earnings press release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken Kannappan :  Thank you, Greg. Our third quarter was marked by strong financial results, progress in strengthening our position in key markets, and progress and support of future growth and organizational agility. Revenue growth of 8% was driven by a rebound in Unified Communications revenue combined with strong Mobile headset sales. Operating income and EPS were above expectations, aided by stronger than expected gross margins as a result of a one-time benefit that Pam will discuss. In addition, operating expenses were below our expectations due primarily to lower-than-expected legal costs. OCC revenues grew 5% as a result of the pickup in UC and strength in Asia Pacific and Europe. As we expected, UC rebounded from the September quarter; and the overall growth trajectory of the UC market is in line with our expectations. Our UC revenues grew by 20% over the prior-year quarter. With three quarters of FY14 reported, we are on track to achieve UC revenue growth of slightly under 30% in fiscal year 2014. The market model in our corporate presentation by Frost & Sullivan suggests 40% average compound annual growth rate in UC. And as previously communicated, we expect to be below that rate for the next several years. We also expect continued volatility in the UC market. Accordingly, it is entirely possible to have another down quarter although we are not expecting it in the near term. We remain confident that UC will be the primary mode of Enterprise communications and will reach mass-market adoption from the low single-digit rate of adoption today. While it is impossible to predict with precision the growth of the market, we expect FY15 to be another good year of growth. As we do every year, we'll communicate updates to our market model when we report our Q4 results. Our market position in UC, our technology leadership and overall solution set are as strong as ever. Turning to the Mobile product group, revenues grew 20% year over year due to strength in the stereo Bluetooth headset market combined with market share gains in both mono and stereo Bluetooth. I'm pleased with our execution in the Mobile product group, especially with the line up of products in our pipeline. We previewed some next generation mobile products with leading buyers at the Consumer Electronics Show, which were well received by attendees. We received two CES Innovation, Design and Engineering Awards at CES. We've also won two prestigious iF design awards. Our Gaming revenues grew by 4% year over year. Our newly-introduced RIG Gaming headset received a rating of excellent from PC Magazine and generally stellar reviews from other market influencers. We are still an early entrant into the console space and believe we are making progress building the right partnership ecosystem for long-term success. Our investment in innovation over the past year is focused on extending the capabilities of our core parts beyond excellent communications toward solving everyday customer problems. We formed a group within Plantronics known as PLT Labs. And the solutions they are focused on increasingly combined hardware, software and firmware to anticipate user intentions and manage connections to communicate devices intelligently. Our capabilities in the field of wearable technology are increasingly being recognized. For example, at a recent Cisco CIO Summit, John Chambers demonstrated how our headset combined with Cisco solutions can provide a revolutionary new and improved consumer experience. Among other features, the demonstration depicted a consumer in a retail establishment wearing the Cisco System for a specific product and utilizing in-store GPS linked to sensors in our headset and ultimately directing the consumer to the specific aisle and shelf where the product was located. Technology is real and functional, and we've opened up the headset for development, meaning the application creators can capture a broad set of sensor data from the wear of our headset such as who you are, where you are and what you are seeing. The potential for our headset in the wearable field is broad with possibilities in fitness, commerce and gaming. We continue to invest and build our organization to support future growth and improved organizational agility. On the operation side, we smoothly transitioned manufacturing to our new 800,000 square foot facility in Mexico with no material disruptions or complications. The grand opening ceremony was held in December, and we are on track to realize savings of several million dollars annually. We're also making good progress on our ERP re-implementation to provide better financial reporting and management. Additionally, we've been focused on improving sales coordination for global accounts and key partners, introducing new channel marketing programs. The objective of our infrastructure building is to be prepared to scale for growth and improve everything we do, including improving the overall customer experience and solution set, speeding innovation, improving quality, and reducing cycle times for all processes and activities. Our investments for growth, including innovation and advanced technologies, and strengthening our presence and position among strategic partners, channel partners, and end customers as the provider of choice. As we plan for FY15, we intend to grow earnings commensurate with revenue growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pam. Pam Strayer :  Thanks, Ken. I'll start with an overview of the quarter before getting into more detail. We exceeded revenue guidance on strong results in both Mobile and UC, with strong growth in the Europe and Africa and Asia Pacific regions. However, the global macro economic environment remains somewhat choppy. Profitability was also well above our expectations through a combination of factors which I'll cover shortly. Second-quarter net revenues were $213 million, representing 8% growth over the prior year. Non-GAAP operating income of $44 million was an increase of 5% compared to Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.76 is $0.03 higher than the prior year, an increase of 4%. When we gave our guidance for the quarter on October 29, we expected non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.65 per share. There are several things that contributed to our EPS this quarter and pushed us above the high end of that range. First, we recorded a one-time adjustment to our warranty and RMA accruals, which contributed $0.05 per share to EPS. Second, revenue was higher than guidance and operating expenses were lower than guidance, driving another $0.03 per share. Further, our non-GAAP tax rate was lower than guidance expectations, largely due to the tax benefit on the warranty adjustment, adding another $0.02 per share. Finally, we had lower-than-expected share count, driven by greater volume of stock repurchases and fewer stock option exercises during the quarter adding another $0.01 per share. Now I'm going to cover revenue in more detail. Total net revenues for the third quarter of $212.7 million were up $15.3 million, or 8% compared to the third quarter last year. All of our regions experienced growth. The Americas grew 2%, Europe and Africa grew 16%, and Asia Pac grew 26% over the prior year. The following are key product line comparisons to Q3 last year. OCC net revenues of $146.6 million were up roughly $7.2 million and 5%. UC was the driver for the growth, while core OCC was generally flat compared to the prior year quarter. UC revenues of $43.2 million were up $7.2 million, or 20% over Q3 of the prior year. Net revenues for Mobile products were up $8.7 million and 20% compared to a year ago. This increased the mix of Mobile revenues to roughly 25% of our total revenues compared to 22% in Q3 of the prior year. Our growth in Mobile products was driven primarily by strong sales of our Voyager Legend and BackBeat GO 2 products. Non-GAAP gross margin is better than expected being flat compared to last year's 52.2% even with the higher mix of Mobile revenue. Our gross margin this quarter benefited from the one-time adjustment related to the correction of our [counting] for product warranty and returns. This adjustment involved improved gross margins by 130 basis points. Excluding this adjustment, gross margins would have been 50.9%, with a decrease driven primarily by product mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $67.1 million, up $5.8 million but below our high-end expectations by about $1 million, primarily as a result of lower-than-anticipated legal expenses. The discovery phase of our GN lawsuit started later in the quarter than expected, but it has begun now; and we expect higher legal expenses for the fourth quarter. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 31.5%, up 50 basis points from the prior year of 31.0%. The major drivers of the increase were higher headcount, annual merit increases and higher variable compensation. Additionally, product launches drove higher marketing expenses compared with last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 20.7%, down from 21.1% in the prior year. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.1%. As a result of all of these items, our Q3 non-GAAP net income of $33.1 million was 6% higher than a year ago, yielding non-GAAP EPS of $0.76, up $0.03 from last year's Q3 results and better than our guidance. The warranty adjustment was a one-time correction in Q3, which improved EPS by approximately $0.05 per share. Now on to balance sheet and cash flow highlights. We finished the quarter with $429 million in cash and investments on our balance sheet and generated over $34 million in cash flow from operations during the period. Of the $429 million in cash and investments at quarter end, $27 million was domestic. We used $29.4 million to repurchase shares during the quarter. DSO was 56 days, up from 51 days at the end of Q3 of the prior year. The increase was due to slow customer payments, primarily by one of our largest distributors who paid slowly due to the holiday schedule this year. We expect our customers to return to normal aging levels at the end of this quarter. Net inventories were flat versus a year ago. Inventory turns are up to 6.2 compared to 5.7 in Q3 of last year. Turning to our capital expenditures, our Q3 investment was $10.4 million, or 4.9% of net revenue. The largest single item in Q3 related to capitalized cost of our Oracle R12 implementation. In addition, we invested in furniture and equipment for our new manufacturing facility in Tijuana, Mexico, and building improvements at our corporate headquarters in Santa Cruz. We are making good progress in investing in our infrastructure to scale for future growth. Our building consolidation in Mexico is complete, and our new ERP system is on track and expected to go live in Q1 of FY15. This new system will be instrumental in supporting global processes, improving global data and analytics, and reducing our cost of maintenance on the system. Depreciation expense on a GAAP basis for Q3 was $3.7 million and was down from $4.1 million in the third quarter last year. We're forecasting to spend approximately $12 million in capital expenditures next quarte,r for an annual total of about $50 million for the full fiscal year. Turning to the outlook. We believe total net revenues for our fourth fiscal quarter ending in March will be in the range of $200 million to $210 million. This forecast assumes gross margin to be similar to this quarter's gross margins. Our product mix will shift back to lower Mobile revenues, and we will not have the one-time benefit we reported in Q3. Depending on revenue mix and other factors, we believe our non-GAAP operating income will be approximately $36 million to $40 million. This resulted in operating margin which is just below our long-term targeted range.  Our guidance expect that we will spend roughly $1 million on the GN lawsuit in Q4. As a reminder, we are including GN litigation costs as part of our non-GAAP results based on our policy for non-GAAP reporting. The GN lawsuit has recently entered the discovery phase, and the impact to operating income from the associated legal expenses is particularly difficult to forecast. Actual expenses can vary significantly from our forecast. Non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 27%. Based on all of the above, we currently expect non-GAAP EPS to be $0.62 to $0.68 per share on average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 43 million. The GAAP reconciling items we expect in the fourth quarter include approximately $6 million in stock-based compensation expense and purchase accounting amortization before tax. Therefore, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.52 to $0.58 per share for the March quarter. Our operating margins were better than expected in Q3; and as we plan for FY15, we will be targeting operating margins within the 20% to 23% range. Our investments in product and processes continue to distinguish Plantronics among its peers in the market and in the price premium we are able to maintain in certain product groups. As Ken mentioned, one of the foremost priorities is to invest for long-term growth while maintaining a level of profitability within our targeted range. We believe we can do this while maintaining a level of profitability which is above the technology industry average.  With that, I'll turn it back to the Operator for Q&A. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Dave King from Roth Capital. Your line is open. Dave King \u2013 Roth Capital Partners : Hello. I guess, first off, Ken, do you see growth this quarter, I guess, for the the second straight quarter is coming and decelerating a bit? I'm wondering if you could just talk about what may be going on there. Is there anything in terms of contract getting pushed out? Anything you want to allude to? Or anything you want to talk about in terms of what may be happening in the industry that, you know \u2013 versus that three percentage-ish kind of rate plus that you talked about before? Ken Kannappan :  Yes. You know I don\u2019t think that we had net contrasting pushed out at the quarter. I think that reflected the largely speaking the growth rate in the industry. It is and has been always a little bit bumpy. There are a lot of companies that we believe are in the pipeline that have not yet moved forward. We continue to think that pipeline builds but it\u2019s a market that is not unfortunately a rocket ship. It\u2019s the kind of system that makes sense \u2013 is far more perspective, flexible, greater performance and yet people have working communication system so they don't have to change right away and there\u2019s some work and effort in doing that as we have talked about. So you know we\u2019re very sure about the future because really there is no effective alternative for people. The legacy systems aren't going to get continued investment but the pace at which it happens is still to be determined. Dave King \u2013 Roth Capital Partners : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Pam, in terms of gross margin, if you could kind of back out the 130 basis point gain that you had and then understanding that a lot of the contraction year over year was due to mix, looks like there was some other things that may have been driving it a little bit more than that. Anything that you can touch on whether it\u2019s in certain segments more so than others that might be driving some of the remaining contraction there? I guess that would be helpful. Pam Strayer : Yes. So, product mix itself contributed 130 basis \u2013 sorry 110 basis points decline year over year. Now, really those two things, the warranty was just an offset by product mix are by far the largest. You know we did take an E&O charge of this quarter. That was roughly 50 basis points impact to the gross margin but that was the highlight. Dave King \u2013 Roth Capital Partners : Okay. Now, and then as we think about, you know, charters on a go-forward basis, you know, given that you\u2019ve had some for a few quarters, how should we think about that also, you know, as you think about that charge or gain you got this quarter? You know was that \u2013 I mean I may have missed it in your comments you\u2019ve had \u2013 was that driven by some of the stuff you recognize invested you were able to recover? And then, how should \u2013 I guess just how should we think about that on a go-forward basis quick? Pam Strayer : On E&O charges going forward, I would still estimate roughly $500,000 to $750,000 per quarter is what we expect to be in the normal range. We're not there yet. But I will say that we've done an awful lot of work on all of the processes around E&O, things that contribute to E&O, and we expect that number to be coming down next quarter. Dave King \u2013 Roth Capital Partners :  Got it. Thanks so much. Great quarter, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Daniel Toomey from Raymond James. Your line is open. Daniel Toomey \u2013 Raymond James : Yes. Thank you. You've answered part of my question, but as far as Mobile, the growth rate, looks like that's also decelerating and wondering if you had any comments for us about your forecast for growth in the Mobile part? Ken Kannappan :  Well, you know, actually we thought it was a really good year in Mobile. The category has declined this year, and outside of China had declined for a couple of years, as well. And so, growing the revenues in the face of that is a pretty good result in terms of the mono segment and we had a pretty significant lift in market share. You know I think that within the stereo area, which is growing, we had a good entrance into the stereo area. We've got some other good products there that we think can expand the segment that we're in. So we feel very good about how we're executing. That said, I do think the mono category, absent new hands-free laws, is unlikely to see significant category growth, and that's certainly going to limit the growth that we're likely to have in that part of the market. Overall, we still expect to grow primarily due to the opportunities outside of mono. Daniel Toomey \u2013 Raymond James : Okay, thanks. And the two new products that you had commented received good reception, has sell through continued to be good through the quarter and into current quarter? Ken Kannappan :  Well just to be clear, those two new products are not products that have launched yet, but products rather that we were previewing. And relative to your other question, I don't have complete sell through data post Christmas. We get some data weekly, we get some data at the end of the month. I would say that generally speaking, yes, we had good sell through data for the Bluetooth business. Daniel Toomey \u2013 Raymond James : Okay, thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from Paul Coster from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Paul Chang \u2013 JPMorgan:  Thanks for taking my question. This is actually Paul Chang for Paul Coster. Most of my questions have been answered, but can you comment on if you see new competitors in the UC space? And also on a second question, can you comment on headcount turnover or job mobility in the Contact Center of space and what you're seeing there? Ken Kannappan :  Sure, so first of all in terms of new competitors, we -- the primary competitor that we have remains GN Netcom, Jabra. There are actually many other competitors that we see from time to time. Those include certainly Sennheiser, certainly Microsoft from the hardware side of the business. There are other smaller players that are in the business. We certainly expect that those will be in the business at some point in time, we haven't actually seen a product from them in this part of the business as yet. But so I would say, I don't think there's been a significant change in competitors to this point. I think there was a second question that you asked me and I'm trying to remember what it was. Paul Chang \u2013 JPMorgan: Right. Just on headcount turnover or job mobility in the Contact Center space. Ken Kannappan :  Sure, so I think that in terms of overall headcount turnover, we think that the tone, and this is not specific to context there, we think the tone has slightly improved. The housing market definitely firmed some, that was one barrier to labor mobility, at least in the US. I think we've finally had a little bit of an upturn in Southern Europe, or at least stabilization. I think the US economy, the UK economy have both improved some and those are encouraging in terms of the potential for overall turnover. Now, I do think it's been clear that the labor market participation has declined and that that is the primary reason the unemployment rate has gone down. So it's not directly helping us. There was some improvement in the quits number which is more directly related and encouraging. Now, we don't get that by Contact Center versus other market segments, but my general feeling is with the tone of that market has also improved a little bit. Paul Chang \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay, great. Thanks. Operator :  Your next question comes from Mike Latimore from Northland Capital. Your line is open. Mike Latimore \u2013 Northland Capital Markets :  Yes. Thanks a lot. In the past you've given some general color on segment revenue in the following quarter. Do you think Office and Contact Center would grow, Mobile would be down? Generally how do you think about some of the\u2026 (CROSSTALKING) Ken Kannappan :  Sure. I mean Mobile of course is a seasonally weaker quarter in the March quarter compared to the December quarter. That said, we still expect to have what we would consider to be a good quarter in Mobile, as well as a good quarter in Office and Contact Center. So -- and that's all implicit of what we've already put out in the forecast. But ordinarily and at times we've certainly seen a slightly larger drop from the seasonally strong December quarter to the March quarter. So yes we have a -- we're expecting good prospects in both areas. Pam Strayer :  I will add that for Mobile in Q4 our forecast assumes a year-over-year decline. If you recall Q4 last year was when the China hands-free law went into effect and we had unusually high Mobile quarter, at that quarter. Ken Kannappan :  Yes, that's it's spike. So, you look at the business in part without the spike. Mike Latimore \u2013 Northland Capital Markets : Right, right, okay. And then you talked about generally 20% to 23% target margins, that would be I believe -- I think achievable in fiscal 2015. I wonder is that true, a clarification question there? And second does that include legal expenses? Ken Kannappan :  So, let me answer the first part and then I'll let Pam talk about the part with the legal. So yes, we do expect to be north of the 20% on our true business basis which is how we are managing the business. Whether or not the legal drops us below that, can you comment on that? Pam Strayer :  Well I would say that right now our forecast for legal expenses would again bring us down to the low end of the range, but we plan to be between 20% and 23% next year. Now it's anybody's guess how much we end up spending on legal, so that's very difficult to forecast. Ken Kannappan :  So, probably including the legal, we're going to be getting very close to the bottom end of that range. Mike Latimore \u2013 Northland Capital Markets : Okay, great. And then last question for me, you talk in the past about some R&D and sales and marketing investments to support, particularly the R&D side to support UC initiatives. How do you generally think about that? Is that something that you're finishing up in the fourth quarter here, and then you start curtailing from there, or where are you in that investment pattern? Ken Kannappan :  We're really in a very good place. We've done a lot of work over the past years. We think our portfolio is well ahead competitively. We think that our investments in the ecosystem have again put us well ahead of everyone. We think we're really driving innovation in the industry. We have opportunities to further innovate to drive long-term growth in the business but these are not things that we have to do. We're also working pretty significant project to improve our efficiency and our platforming, R&D investments to allow us to be faster and more effective per dollar that we spend.  So we're expecting if you look going forward to be able to leverage the fact that we're ahead, leverage some improvements and still have some pretty good innovation investments. These are not quick things. These take probably a couple of years, but I would expect over the course of that it's more likely that we will see our R&D expenditures, particularly over the second year, begin to decline a little bit as a percentage of revenues, and maybe not decline so much as a percentage of revenues in the coming year. Mike Latimore \u2013 Northland Capital Markets : Great, thanks. Operator :  Your last question comes from Greg Burns from Sidoti & Company. Your line is open. Greg Burns \u2013 Sidoti &Company : Afternoon. Question on PLT labs, could you give us an update on the kind of interest you're seeing from the developer community, and when we might see a commercial headset with some of the new capabilities being rolled out? Ken Kannappan :  Sure. Well first of all, we had a hackathon just before the Consumer Electronic Show, which was about three days long. And we showed our concept and one headset at that time and people were writing applications on it. And ultimately the leader of that team was on a panel at the end of the hackathon.  We've gone to a number of these wearable technology conferences, have been recognized as the leading innovator at a number of these and had people write applications for it. But it's less about independent applications, not that there can't be some great ideas there, and more about the integration with key partners into some of their applications. And that's part of the reason I gave the example of Cisco, because it's a key partner for us and we have other key partners integrating or looking to integrate with our products as well. And some of these new products will be able to leverage all the integrations that have already occurred. They create additional capabilities for things beyond that. So we have things that are already out there. We expect with more capabilities that people will do more. We have in our minds the UC Voyager Legend is a product out there out there already was significant sensors, significant contextual intelligence that provide APIs to communicated and software that is taking advantage of that. With these new capabilities, it's always -- take some time to productize that and so it will be some time before we put it out there, I'm not providing a date at this point in time. But this is a continuous process that we're embarked on. Greg Burns \u2013 Sidoti &Company : Okay, thanks. And in terms of UC sales, in any given quarter could you give us a sense of how much are greenfield or new deals as opposed to cultivating more season deals and getting further penetration? Are you seeing some of your older deals then come back and take more headsets as they mature? Ken Kannappan :  So, the answer to the question is, it's almost all greenfield. There are absolutely early adopters who are replacing or they took all corded and some people want cordless and that kind of stuff. Having said that, this UC market is really amazing. Let's remember that it's only been a few years that we've been selling these headsets. And therefore there weren't really, if you look at our revenues three years ago, there's not that much out there to replace. Almost nobody replaces within two years. So you don't really have a big pool of replacement revenues to go to. Greg Burns \u2013 Sidoti &Company : Okay, thank you. Operator :  We have no further questions at this time. Greg Klaben :  Thanks again for joining us today. We'll be available after the call if you have additional questions. Operator :",

My name is Bobby and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 fiscal year 2014 conference call. (Operator Instructions). Thank you Greg Klaben, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Greg Klaben : Thanks very much Bobby. Welcome everyone to Plantronics Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Conference Call. Joining me today are Ken Kannappan, Plantronics President and CEO, and Pam Strayer, Plantronics Senior Vice President and CFO. The information presented and discussed today includes forward-looking statements which are made under the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The risks and uncertainties related to such statements are detailed in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K in today's press release. For the remainder of today's call, we'll be providing only non-GAAP metrics related to gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and EPS. We have reconciled these measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly analyst metric sheet, both of which are available on the investor relations page of our website. Additionally, after the conclusion of today's call, the recording of the call will be available with the information on our website. Unless stated otherwise, all comparisons of the fourth quarter fiscal 2014 financial results after the same quarter and the prior fiscal year. Plantronics fourth quarter fiscal 2014 net revenues were $209.1 million. Plantronics GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.65 compared with $0.67 last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.74 compared with $0.71.   The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter consists of charges for stock-based compensation and purchase accounting amortization, both net of the associated tax impact and tax benefits from the release of tax reserves. Please refer to the full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP in our earnings press release. I would like to remind you that we will be holding an Investor Day at our new manufacturing plant in Tijuana, Mexico on June 25th. For more information please contact me. Finally I would like to also note that a change in our naming convention for two major revenue categories beginning next quarter we will begin reporting revenues for consumer as a single category comprising mobile, gaming and entertainment and clarity revenue. We will also begin referring to office and contact centers enterprise. There is no change in the reclassification of revenues within enterprise and this change reflects larger opportunity being driven by Unified Communications and our evolving solution for how and where people work. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken Kannappan :  Thank you Greg. At fiscal 2014 we achieved record revenues of 818.6 million, record operating income of a 166 million and record earnings per share of $2.85. I like to highlight five key takeaways from our fiscal 2014. First, the year was a year of investment and our organization scaled for significant anticipated growth driven by Unified Communications. We opened our new manufacturing plant in Tijuana which is significantly more efficient by consolidating operations for multiple facilities into one. Recently we were named the Best Place to Work in Mexico for the fourth consecutive year. We just invested in our workspaces around the world to enable what we refer to as smarter work feedback from the employees and customers and partners visiting our locations, it has been overwhelmingly positive. Literally 1000s of visitors, many of them seeking to emulate the technology and productivity that we have achieved. We continue to build our R&D capabilities opening a software center in Austin. We just went live today on an upgraded ERP system from improved global processes and scaling. We have invested heavily in UC over the past several years and as a result operating expenses grew faster than revenues. Fiscal 2015, we\u2019re planning for future profits to grow at a rate similar to revenues and anticipating an improvement in operating margins as the year progresses. Our second point is with 27% growth in revenue in fiscal 2014, Unified Communications continues to be our key strategic focus. Revenue from our UC product portfolio represents 28% of our OCC revenues up from 24% the prior year. We believe that we are in a very beginning of the long term growth opportunity with the vast majority of the UCC opportunity still in front of us. Third our long term expected growth rates in the size of the UC business remain unchanged and we continue to believe that we\u2019re in very early stages. Our combined markets are expected to grow approximately 13% per year. This is identical to the growth estimates that we provided last year, the only difference being the five year time period beginning in calendar year \u201913 versus calendar year \u201912 last year. This growth rate is being driven by increased headset usage and as a result of the use of Unified Communications Technology. We anticipate more modest growth in the near term similar to recent growth rates. However, we\u2019re seeing evidence that UC will begin to pick up. Greg will cover additional details of our market growth expectations later in the call. Fourth, we have consistently returned substantially all U.S. cash for our shareholders and repurchases and dividends and we anticipate continue to return sizeable portions of U.S. cash to our stockholders in fiscal 2015. Today we announce a dividend increase from $0.10 per share per quarter to $0.15 to balance our payout to 1/3rd of free cash flow going as dividends 2/3rds of repurchases of domestic U.S. cash flow. Fifth, we remain as confident as ever in our leadership position in the enterprise headset market and the growing UC market. Our continuing innovation breakthrough\u2019s and contextual intelligence, some other features and enhancements in our UC portfolio, whereas to maintain a premium position at fiscal \u201914 and we have the opportunity to strengthen that position fiscal \u201915. Today we just won a Partner Innovation Award from Avaya at their International User Group Conference. In fiscal 2015 we will focus on these key goals and we will, one, deliver profitable growth by delivering compelling communications experience and help customers improve efficiency and ease of use across the enterprise. Number two, extend our brand to be relevant to a broader addressable market. Number three, extend our consumer reach to become the indispensable interface users turn to with connected experiences through their day. Number four, scale for growth by improving operational effectiveness and flexibility of the value chain. And number five optimize our culture through innovation, productivity and employee well-being. We\u2019re well-positioned to achieve these goals and let us to continue to increase long term stockholder value and cash flow generation. With that I would like to turn the call over to Pam to go over our Q4 results. Pam Strayer :  Thanks Ken. I will start with the key points for getting into the detail for the quarter. First our financial results were better than expected with our revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance and earnings per share exceeding guidance. I\u2019m also pleased that we did better than expected for operating margins in the quarter with our Q4 operating margin coming in at the low end of our long term target range of 20% and we achieved better than that for the full year with operating margins of 20.3%. Second we\u2019re planning for profit growth commensurate with revenue growth in fiscal 2015. As Ken mentioned fiscal 2014 was the year of investment, we invested in our infrastructure, people and products to scale for growth ahead of anticipated UC growth. While operating expenses grew faster than revenue in fiscal 2014 we were expected modest margin improvement for the full fiscal year 2015 as revenue expenses grow at similar pace. Third, we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders. Today, we announced a 50% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.10 to $0.15 per share per quarter. In fiscal 2014, we returned to a total of $103 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends. Essentially all of our domestic cash generation was returned to our shareholders. The share repurchases for the last fiscal year totaled 1.9 million shares, the dividend increase for fiscal 2015 is in-line with our philosophy of returning approximately 1/3rd of our domestic cash generations to our stockholders in dividend the balance being share repurchases. We expect to continue our current approach at pace to share repurchases while being prepared to be opportunistic. Our Q4 revenue results were driven by strength in OCC and better than expected growth in mobile. We experienced modest growth in core OCC and another quarterly record in UC net revenue. Geographically the U.S. was the strongest and the only geography to grow year-over-year. Fourth quarter net revenues were 209.1 million representing 2% growth over the prior year which is a tough comparison given that we have the positive effect of the China hands-free law last year. For a better understanding of this impact when it's excluded from the results, our year-over-year growth would have been approximately 8%. Non-GAAP operating income of 41.7 million is flat compared to Q4 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.74 it's $0.03 [ph] higher than the prior year increase of 4%. Now I will cover revenue in more detail. Total net revenues for the fourth quarter of 209.1 million were up 4.9 million or 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year all of which was driven by 10% growth in the Americas. Revenues in our Europe and Africa region declined by 2% and our Asia-PAC region by 24%. The following are key product line comparisons to Q4 last year. OCC net revenues of 150.5 million were up roughly $7.8 million and 6%, UC was the driver for that growth while core OCC was up slightly compared to the prior year quarter. UC revenues of $43.6 million were up 6.8 million or 18% over Q4 of the prior year. Net revenues from mobile products were up in the U.S. offset by declines in China resulting in last year-over-year performance. The strong demand spike in the prior year due to the China hands-free adoption provides a tough comparison. Excluding the spike last year, our mobile revenues increased 26% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin was better than expected at 53.5% up 120 basis points compared with last year\u2019s gross margin of 52.3%. Average product margins increased by 80 basis points due to product mix primarily due to lower mobile revenues. In addition freight was lower than historical levels this quarter. We had built-up our inventory levels with the end of Q3 and beginning of Q4 in preparation for the Chinese new year supplier shutdown. These higher inventory levels meant that more economic or shipping methods could be used. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 70 million up $5.2 million compared to Q4 of last year due primarily to additional headcount investments as well merit increases. In addition marketing litigation and travel cost all increased. As a percentage of revenue operating expenses were 33.5% up 170 basis points in the prior year of 31.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 20.0% down from 20.5% in the prior year. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.5%. As a result all these items are Q4 non-GAAP net income of 31.8 million was 4% higher than a year ago yielding non-GAAP EPS of $0.74 per share up $0.03 from last year\u2019s Q4 results. Now for a balance sheet and cash flow highlights. We finished the quarter with $436 million in cash and investments in our balance sheet and generated over $49 million of cash flow from operations during the period. Off the $436 million in cash and investments at quarter end, $17 million was domestic. We used $28.9 million to repurchase shares during the quarter. DSO was 60 days, up from 57 days at the end of Q4, the prior year. The increase was due primarily to the timing of billings within the quarter and a reduction of our offsetting reserves for products returns. Net inventories were down 10.3 million or 14.2% versus a year ago. Inventory turns are up to 6.9 compared to 5.8 in Q4 of last year. Turning to our capital expenditures, our Q4 investment was $13.3 million or 6.4% of net revenues. Large expenditures include (indiscernible) facility improvement and equipment in Tijuana [ph] for our operations in Mexico. We are making good progress and investing in our infrastructure to scale the future growth. Our building consolidation in Mexico is complete and our new ERP system has just gone online. This new system will be instrumental in supporting global profits, improving global data and analysis and reducing our cost of maintenance from the system. Depreciation expense on a GAAP basis for Q4 was $3.8 million and was down slightly from $4 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Turning to the outlook, We believe total net revenues for our first fiscal quarter ending in June will be in the range of $205 million to $215 million. This forecast assumes gross margin to be in the range of approximately 52.5% and 53% lower than the current quarter margins due to an effective increases in freight and E&O expenses as we revert back to more typical quarter spend pattern in those areas as well as some product mix in terms of higher UC revenues and higher mobile revenues compared to Q4. Depending on revenue mix and other factors we believe our GAAP operating income will be approximately $31 million to $35 million and non-GAAP operating income of approximately $38 million to $42 million. The GAAP reconciling items we expect in the first quarter include appropriate $7 million in stock based compensation expense and purchase accounting amortization before tax. Although this result in the non-GAAP operating margin which is just below our long term targeted range, we expect to make up for this one higher profitability in the second half of the year. Our guidance expects that we were (indiscernible) approximately 1.5 million on GN litigation in Q1. As a reminder we\u2019re including GN litigation cost as part of our non-GAAP results based on our policy for non-GAAP reporting. The GN litigation is in discovery phase and the impact to operating income from the associated legal expenses is particularly difficult to forecast. Actual expenses can vary significantly from our forecast. Also know that the reimplementation of our ERP system and the current quarter may reduce revenue visibility and possibly impede short term expense management. Included in our non-GAAP guidance is a $2 million benefit to operating expenses which we will receive as part of a binding agreement with one of our competitors to this litigation. The litigation involves the alleged infringement of our patents for ear bud technology to improve the fit of Bluetooth headset. We expect to receive a $2 million patent benefit per quarter for the first two quarters and the third and fourth quarters the benefit will be $1.6 million each. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter is expected to be 27%, and we\u2019re anticipating a full year tax rate of 27% based on all the above in the first quarter we expect GAAP EPS of $0.54 to $0.61 per share and non-GAAP EPS to be $0.65 to $0.72 per share on average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 42.9 million. Our full fiscal year 2015 plan reflects operating margins up slightly from fiscal 2014 and for capital expenditures that are approximately 30% of revenue. With that I will turn it over to Greg who will cover the long term market model update for the year. Greg Klaben : Thanks Pam. At the beginning of every fiscal year we update our total addressable market and growth expectations for the subsequent five years. Working with industry analyst firms across (indiscernible) and strategic analytics in addition to our own estimates we updated the average compound annual growth rate expected for our markets from calendar year 2013 to calendar 2018. I will walk you through the total addressable market and if you haven't already seen our new IR presentation with these slides they are available on IR section of our website. Note that it's mentioned earlier, we will be changing office and contact center, the category to enterprise and there is no change in the classification of revenues within this category and it refers to enterprises of both sizes. We will also begin reporting revenues from our consumer product lines as a single category called consumer comprised of Bluetooth, gaming and entertainment and clarity products. I will start with slide number 13 in our IR deck. We cited [ph] our total addressable market at $2.3 billion as of calendar year 2013 growing to $4.3 billion in calendar year 2018 for CAGR of approximately 13%. This is the same growth rate we had forecast last year for the five year period ending in calendar year 2017. The enterprise market is estimated to be $1 billion in 2013 growing to $2.3 billion for CAGR of 17% to 18%. This is higher than the CAGR we provided last year of 16% to 17%. The consumer opportunity is estimated to be 1.3 billion in calendar year 2013 growing to 2 billion in the calendar year 2018. The compound annual growth rate for this period is expected to be 8% to 10% which is higher than last year\u2019s range of 7% to 8%. The next slide number 14 shows the enterprise opportunity in greater detail. The UC market is expected to grow from 300 million in calendar year 2013 to 1.5 billion in calendar 2018, a CAGR of 38% to 40%. It's a very slight decline from last year\u2019s model. Before enterprise, CAGR is expected to be 1% over the same time period. Higher headset attach rate is driving our revenue opportunity and slide 15 we estimated that the current headset attach rate to 425 million knowledge workers globally is currently approximately 6%. The estimated attach rate in 2018 is forecasted to be 13% to 450 million knowledge workers. On the next slide number 16, we have our assumptions with the UC market which are mostly unchanged just updated to reflect calendar year 2018. The forecast for active UC voice licenses is 94 million with an attach rate expected to be 60% with a total install headset base of 56 million headsets. In 2018 the forecast is for 22 million UC audio devices sold and an ASP which is consistent with our prior model. Our total market size is $1.5 billion. Factored into the assumption of the market size for 2018 are replacement revenues to the installed base of UC headsets users which is estimated to be less than a third of the total market revenues. Our expectations are -- we maintain market share, the UC market had a level similar to today over the next five years. Note that our definition of UC narrower than some other companies and that our definition of voice license requires a voice capabilities have been activated and in use not simply licenses sold. As UC becomes an increasing portion of enterprise revenues we anticipate that at some point in the future we will discontinue the revenue breakout between core enterprise and UC as we did today, both because it becomes less relevant and because it is increasingly harder to accurately measure whether our headsets are being used in UC environment. I would also like to note that we\u2019re anticipating more modest growth rate for revenues for the fiscal year 2015 as compared with the five year growth rate in our market model. We\u2019re now providing fiscal year 2015 revenue guidance but do emphasize that while we expect continued growth in UC revenues in fiscal 2015 we do not currently expect an acceleration UC revenues in the fiscal year. On the consumer side we\u2019re also currently expecting more modest growth rate as compared with the market growth rate. With that I will open the call for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Dave King from Roth Capital. Your line is open. Dave King - Roth Capital Partners : I guess first off in terms of the guidance for revenue, I guess I\u2019m just curious how we should think about that by segment and from your prepared remarks it sounds like UC should be kind of a similar growth rates what we saw this quarter and then traditional OCC or enterprise I didn\u2019t catch, if that should be similar or not? And then on the consumer side I think from your comments Pam it sounds like maybe that\u2019s a little bit higher than it was. So there should be some sequential growth there but maybe in that context you can tell us how much the China hands-free stuff contributed in the year ago period or the year ago June so we can think about that somewhere. Thanks. Pam Strayer : Sure. So for the guidance for next quarter we do expect mobile to be a little bit higher portion of total revenues going down our gross margin a little bit. We don\u2019t typically give any more detail into the revenue line now but I would agree that the UC growth rate expectations will be similar to what we experienced this quarter. Dave King - Roth Capital Partners : Okay and then I guess as we just more big picture, as we think about that UC growth rate it has slowed a bit obviously in over the past few quarters and it seems like it maybe tracking at a little bit of a slow rate than the industry or certainly striking slower than what the forecast you guys have in there from some of the industry people in terms of that 38% to 40%. And it looks there may have been some share losses over the past couple of quarters. Can we talk about what might be going on there both from an end market perspective and then competitive front and then how we should think about why that should reaccelerate? Ken Kannappan : Sure. Well first of all actually we think we\u2019re competing well in the market. It is difficult to get good or accurate data and I will just kind of comment on that a little bit. The major players don\u2019t necessarily provide public disclosures of the number of active voice proceeds [ph] that are growing. Our primary competitor disclosed the data on a different basis than we do and then there are a number of people who aren\u2019t disclosing any data. So it's a little difficult to say. For sure there are timing issues that involve some larger customers and when they happen to roll things out. Our general sense is that we are doing very well in the market and are not losing any fundamental market share. I think that if we look at some of the issues in the market that happened over the course of last year and obviously when Jabber became free from Cisco that created a little bit of a slowdown in the market as people started to evaluate. There has certainly being some macroeconomic concerns that have been out there in the market related to that. I think that many companies have gotten serious about moving forward that they have started to look at their infrastructure and say do we really have all the pikes [ph] that we need, the necessary Wi-Fi bandwidth everywhere across our organization in order to ensure the quality of voice necessary to do these deployments. My sense actually is that the momentum is significantly built. The tone that we heard at Enterprise Connect and the Lync Conference and really across the Board at major events, it's been that people are really gearing up to move forward. Now that\u2019s not to say that I think these are all going to occur this year, the cycle time is pretty long for proof of concept pilots and deployments. But I think that the activity is really picked up in terms of people getting serious about moving forward with it. Dave King - Roth Capital Partners : And then I guess just lastly sort of a clarification and this maybe for you Greg in terms of the slide 16 of the presentation, it looks like or I guess maybe what does that assume in terms of ASPs. It looks like it's around the $68 level or so and then you know is that how do you come with that assumption is that based on the industry guys? Is that you guys are assuming sort of ASP and how does that compare to kind of your current ASPs in UC? Greg Klaben :  It's slightly down from what we\u2019re experiencing today but it's in-line with what we had with the assumption last year\u2019s model at about $68 per device. So there is not much, since it is a combination of our own analysis as well as (indiscernible). Dave King - Roth Capital Partners : Okay and is that similar to what you guys currently have as an ASP in your own business today? Greg Klaben : It fluctuates from deal to deal but it's generally in the range what we\u2019re seeing today. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Bright from Avondale Partners. Your line is open. John Bright - Avondale Partners : Harvesting investments is what I\u2019m hearing from you on this call. I think in your prepared text said that you\u2019re going to grow our earnings as same as your revenue. I assume that has a plan of growth in your expenses that if your revenue accelerates then that can even mean greater margin expansion. Is that fair? Ken Kannappan : It is to some degree. Let me just say that it's probably a little bit more towards the back half of the year than it is in the front half of the year and if -- I am not really anticipating things to get wildly ahead of our expectations but if it does we have been working pretty hard on some strategic growth plans that we\u2019re not yet investing in that we\u2019re prepared to invest in because we are expecting this UC market to begin to hit and when it does we wanted to be prepared and really thought through plans to invest wisely. So we do intend to just let that lag the rate of gross profit growth but that doesn\u2019t mean not to have some incremental investment for future growth opportunities. John Bright - Avondale Partners : Well let me connect some dots on there, I will try to connect some dots, maybe you can help me. About between the industry expectations, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks Ken that you are seeing the evidence of a pickup in UC that kind of goes to the when will the meaningful acceleration of UC happen. So when I try to reconcile 13% industry CAGR, evidence in pickup yet more modest growth rate in FY \u201915, help me connect those dots if you will. Ken Kannappan : Sure. So the cycle time in my mind for many companies when we hear about these things is better than a year in terms of when large deployments happen. Now that doesn\u2019t mean everybody, some of them can be faster but in general I have got to go through a proof of concept that can be anywhere from let\u2019s just call it two months to four months. I have got to go through a pilot that\u2019s probably another three months sometimes 4 or 5 months. Then I got to plan my deployment that\u2019s probably another 2, 3, 4 months and then I\u2019ve to actually deploy and that can be anywhere from three months to a year and half and I would say generally 6 to 12 months. Those aren\u2019t perfect times, they vary, every company is different and certainly larger companies on the longer end, smaller companies are often on the faster end. But the momentum that we\u2019re seeing build is at the front end. Some of that I do think will hit towards the latter part of this fiscal year. Some of it I think will hit the following year. John Bright - Avondale Partners :  This is a simplistic question, Ken, but I know a lot of people ask it. Is there something fundamental you can point to that people can think about that is a driver or the decision to move the UC? Ken Kannappan : Sure. Very, very simply it is a much better tool for communications and collaboration and let me just try to explain that within this. Right now if you look at a legacy phone system it is a blind system in which I make a phone call to you with no knowledge of whether you\u2019re there or not. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re in a meeting, I don\u2019t know if it's a good way to reach you. I\u2019m going to leave that voice message for you. 70% of those calls today in business do hit voice mail. You may call me back much later, you don\u2019t understand exactly what I was thinking. It's clear to me but it wasn\u2019t clear to you. We have played tag, the cycle time of the business becomes slow, it takes several days for us to resolve that item. Imagine instead in a UC world I can see right now that you\u2019re in a meeting, you\u2019re in a conference call. I can IM you right now and ask you a question during that meeting and it pops up, I can see that you\u2019re now available. I can ask you if we can escalate to a call or a video call. I can just boom, click and add right in Greg Klaben because there is a question on the model that we have. I can automatically have a conference call in which we\u2019re sharing PowerPoint presentations or white board or other creative spaces and not only can I do this but I can do this without the rigidity that we have right now with fixed phones and office spaces across $750 of change. Everybody understands that teams are more effective when they are co-located. The rigid phone structures well that\u2019s where your office is prevents you from having the flexibility easily move teams as things grow and move in businesses. It creates a rigidity that makes it hard for people to collaborate as well as you like them to do. It results in separate spaces that are less efficient, most businesses today are trying to shift to improving their internal collaboration because we have many different subject matter experts and how we get them to work together is absolutely crucial and so they are changing their plans within their business. Unified Communications opens that up, it also opens up the opportunity in that context through densification which in our case is saving us about $3 million. Finally people are not just working at the office, working -- an activity, it's not a location anymore. And so at the end of the day I can make people as effective just like they are in their office. Their phone is ringing, everything is operating normal whether they are in their office or whether they are somewhere else. So the value proposition is a superior solution at a vastly lower cost than what they are paying today just in terms of the communication solutions provided you\u2019ve the infrastructure and place. But, it is of change, you directly have the right infrastructure in place to make that change. Is that helpful? John Bright - Avondale Partners : It is. I\u2019m going to the drivers behind it to the cause the organization to make that decision. One of my thoughts has been that internet going to voice-over-IP causes an IT department to examine their needs and that\u2019s what brings the decisions and that\u2019s accelerate (technical difficulty) attach rates. But I was looking for your thoughts or what are industry trends that might be fundamentally moving that so that we can watch those accelerate, we can expect that to happen to Plantronics. Ken Kannappan : Okay well so there is a few things behind this. I mean in all honesty first and foremost is the absorption of more and more young people into the workspace who have grown up accustomed to using instant messaging. Who are accustomed to using Skype video conferencing or bunch of other tools and expect to have that type of tool. As the ecosystem is moving and for example as we have many large companies use this and you as a company are trying to interface those companies and all of a sudden all the other vendors they are competing with you are open federated with that company and do all these tools and you can\u2019t -- its pretty awkward and so there is a growing realization among most corporations, I think the last pull I saw was a 98% of the Global 1000 firms are planning to go forward with UC and the question has been the timing. So I believe, again if you go to these conferences and you talk to companies, almost everybody is planning to go forward. The issue I think that is holding people back now is one of proceeding with the fit to their business which includes again making sure the infrastructure is in place and able to support it. That\u2019s a very comparable item at least in most developed markets. There are some places and particularly for remote operations where the pipe is not adequate to support voice and by that I mean the availability of high bandwidth but beyond that most of the infrastructure is in place, most companies are beginning to either make decisions on the vendors if they want to pick or have already made largely those decisions and I think that they are in the process of moving forward. Now that only refers to large enterprise market. It's going to take more time as we move pass that into the SME and SMB more likely hosted markets to take place. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt from Raymond James. Your line is open. Tavis McCourt - Raymond James :  So after five hours, how is the ERP working? Ken Kannappan : Well it's early days clearly or early hours but we appear to be live and working. Tavis McCourt - Raymond James :  I just wanted to go through some of the puts and take that you mentioned to think about for this year. So what was the gross amount of the IP settlement if that\u2019s what it was, the yearly booking sounds like a counter-expense this year and does that flow into 2015? Ken Kannappan : I don\u2019t believe the word is closing, the gross amount. Greg Klaben : It's 7.2 million. Ken Kannappan : All right I guess I\u2019m been [ph] corrected. Pam Strayer : 7.2 million for the full fiscal year \u201915 and there is nothing else because of the next -- Ken Kannappan : Yes it's completely a coincidence we don\u2019t plan it that way but as it happens it will wind-up offsetting a fair amount of the legal expenditures that we will have on the other matter so that it turns out our financials will actually be fairly reflective, not exactly but fairly reflective of the real business. Tavis McCourt - Raymond James : Got you and that\u2019s what I wanted to check on, so obviously legal expenses are hard to determine but you have any insight on to how long the discovery phase could last? Ken Kannappan : It's hard to say but I suspect that first phase is probably between this quarter and a little bit more it's going to be largely over with we will be moving to other phases. Tavis McCourt - Raymond James : Got you and then Pam on the below the line items, what should we be thinking about for tax rate for fiscal \u201915 and this quarter seemed to have an elevated other income, what kind of a reasonable going forward rate for the non-operating income? Pam Strayer : Yes so for the tax rate last fiscal year you should model it at 27%, that\u2019s what we\u2019re using. For the income below the line there were some small unusual items that went in there. I don\u2019t have them up on top of my head but they were maybe 3 or 4 that were individually immaterial items that we don\u2019t expect to recur. Tavis McCourt - Raymond James :  And is the higher tax rate I guess this will be two years in row, is that related to geographic mix? Pam Strayer : Yes it's very much impacted our geographic mix and last year we had some differences from them as a result of the one time warranty adjusted we made but yes 27% reflects our expectations there 27% with -- when we entered FY \u201914. Tavis McCourt - Raymond James : And then the last question on your UC business as it stands today. I imagine just as in the corded world, the wireless estimates carry a higher ASP and margin than the corded. But are you seeing a higher percentage mix in UC of users taking wireless and if so is that something that you would expect to continue, is that something that\u2019s financially perhaps as meaningful as kind of the overall adoption rate in and of itself? Ken Kannappan : So just to be clear in UC we get a higher ratio of corded rather than wireless and just the way to think about this is that in the non-UC world we primarily sell to people we talk a lot and many of those people who talk a lot therefore it's very important product for them and they are willing to pay for it, they are willing to pay for mobility and the company is willing to invest in them as a result. UC extends us into a lot of people who don\u2019t talk as much and for them it's not as important and for the company it's not as important to invest in the solution for them if you only spend 10 minutes or week on the phone listening to one voice mail or something like that. So on the one end we get incremental lift and on the hand that includes people for whom the category is less important and hence you get a higher mix of corded. Tavis McCourt - Raymond James : And then final question, Pam on the amortization related to the ERP which I assume starts this quarter. Is that baked into this quarter\u2019s expense or is it a half quarter this quarter and then follow through the next quarter? Or is it small enough where it's not worth even worrying about? Pam Strayer : Yes I think it's built into our guidance for Q1 and we will be approximately half the quarter, so yes it's built in there and yes I guess that answers the question. Tavis McCourt - Raymond James : Okay and then despite that you expect margin expansion back half of the year assuming revenues grow like you think they will? Pam Strayer : Yes, we have been modeling that additional depreciation expense all along. So that\u2019s taken into account. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Burns from Sidoti & Company. Your line is open. Greg Burns - Sidoti & Company: So just looking at the mobile business down a little bit year-over-year but still pretty strong considering the tough comp you\u2019re coming off against. Can you just give us some color, are you taking, you would share in the mobile markets? I know you\u2019ve lost a couple of new products. Was it selling? Are those new products into a channel? Just any kind of color you can give around the strong mobile in the quarter. Ken Kannappan : Sure. I think that what we saw globally is that the independent brands gained a lot of share and that included very much Plantronics. We had very, very good share gains both the last couple of years. In addition and I\u2019m referring here primarily to our existing business and voice, Bluetooth if you were or mono Bluetooth. At the same time clearly we entered into the stereo and we have seen growth there which of course by definition include share because really we were pretty small. And yes there is a little bit line fill in that but I don\u2019t think it's a huge number relative to the performance. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Mike Latimore from Northland Capital Management. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst :  (Indiscernible) for Mike Latimore. I guess looking at the UC business, I mean within UC deployments is the mix of headsets to handsets in that business, I mean is that about you expected a year or so ago or is there a little bit more resiliency that you\u2019re seeing in desktop phones. Ken Kannappan : Yes there is a little bit higher mix in headsets than we were planning on initially and that\u2019s probably continued to rise. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then I mean how do you view the macro-environment in the U.S? And what sort of improvements have you seen there and maybe how that compares to what you\u2019re seeing in EMEA or Asia-PAC? Ken Kannappan : Sure. Clearly the U.S. has strengthened some. We believe that a lot of that really relates to business investment decisions rather than individual decisions. In other words we don\u2019t think we have seen this kind of sharp spike in voluntary turnover that you tend to see in robust labor markets. But we think that we have seen interest in business investment which is helped us in the market. I think it's clear that Europe -- the growth is kind of anemic right now. It's certainly not looking like the recession condition or anything like that but it's not being as robust as you know given what happened in December, that we saw in the March quarter and I think there are concerns about Asia-Pacific in terms of a slowdown. Certainly in Russia on the B2B side you know the events there are taking a bit of a hit on economic activity at present. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And just finally just a clarifying question, was the legal expenses that you had guided for the first quarter, was that a 1 million or what was that? Ken Kannappan : 1.5 million. Unidentified Analyst : 1.5 million. Ken Kannappan : And just to be clear that was not legal expenses that was legal expenses specific to GN. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, specific to GN. Okay, all right. Thank you very much. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Klaben I will turn the call back over to you. Greg Klaben : Thanks again everyone for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, we will be available afterwards. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Strayer - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Senior Vice President Analysts : David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division Ryan MacDonald - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Delinah, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Plantronics' First Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Greg Klaben, you may begin your conference. Greg Klaben : Thanks, very much, Delinah, and welcome, everyone, to Plantronics' First Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Conference Call. Joining me today are Ken Kannappan, Plantronics' President and CEO; and Pam Strayer, Plantronics' Senior Vice President and CFO. The information presented and discussed today includes forward-looking statements, which are made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The risks and uncertainties related to such statements are detailed in our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and today's press release. For the remainder of today's call, we will be providing only non-GAAP metrics related to gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and earnings per share. We have reconciled these measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly analyst metric sheet, both of which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Additionally, after the conclusion of today's call, a recording of the call will be available with information on our website. Unless stated otherwise, all comparisons of the first quarter are to the same quarter and the prior fiscal year. Plantronics' first quarter net revenues were $216.7 million. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.68 compared with $0.62 in fiscal 2014. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.78 compared with $0.70. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter consists of charges for stock-based compensation and purchase accounting amortization, both net of the associated tax impact and tax benefits from the release of tax reserves. Please refer to the full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP in our earnings press release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. S. Kenneth Kannappan : Thank you, Greg. During our first quarter of fiscal 2015, we achieved record quarterly revenue, operating income and earnings per share. Revenues grew 7% to $216.7 million, operating income was up 4% and earnings per share grew by 11%. With that backdrop, I'd like to highlight the following 4 points from our first quarter : first, the fundamentals of the Unified Communications or UC market remains solid. We remain confident of market growth over the next few years as more large enterprises move to deploy voice as part of their UC implementation. Our UC revenue grew by 17% and enterprise revenue overall grew by 1% in a challenging comparison to a strong prior year quarter. We continued to receive indications that more and more customers are planning to move forward with their UC deployment and received further indications of this at the recent Microsoft Developer Conference, Cisco Live Conference and Microsoft World Partner Conference. Our position in UC continues to be strong and we continue to receive feedback from the customers and partners that we have the best offering in the market. In addition, our excellence in partnering with the channel and customers to deliver support above and beyond their expectations in our own obligations has helped us establish leadership and excellent customer satisfaction. One example of our partnering was with a Fortune 100 company which began their initial Microsoft Lync rollout with instant messaging and presence in late 2011. They turned on Enterprise voice functionality and Lync in late 2012. During their headset selection process, they undertook a series of product tests and ultimately decided on Plantronics as the only headset solution for their UC deployment. At that point, there was no competitive battle for us, but to ensure their usage goals for Lync were met, our field sales team participated in a series of roadshows with the IT department in all of their major locations. We shared with their employees how we use Lync and the IT department distributed the headsets to their employees for immediate use. Lync usage went up dramatically as a result of the roadshows and their Lync deployment is continuing across Europe and Asia Pacific and the Americas. Our value proposition in UC is clear to our customers, as well as broad. One key proposition is we provide a lower burden on the IT department versus competitive offerings, such as through our Spokes 3.0 platform, which I'll cover later. Additionally, our products work better, employees have a much better user experience, and our aftersales support continues to be rated the best in the industry. Second, we believe that our business model has leveraged in 2 to 3 years. In Q1, we experienced double-digit growth in earnings per share due to healthy top line growth combined with a continued return of cash to stockholders via share repurchases. We believe our business model is leveraged into -- leverage-able in 2 to 3 years as UC growth overtakes our rate of investment for the UC opportunity. It's not something we can plan perfectly, but we aim to grow profits with revenue this fiscal year, and in the long term, we expect to see margin expansion. Third, our consumer business demonstrated very good growth of 25%, due principally to market share gains in mono and stereo Bluetooth. Our Bluetooth sales grew in all major geographies. In the U.S., our calendar year-to-date market share and U.S. model Bluetooth retail is above 45%. Our industry-leading Voyager Legend headset, combined with the success for our new Voyager Edge headset are largely responsible for this strength. Our new BackBeat FIT stereo Bluetooth product started shipping midway through the June quarter and is already one of our top 5 Bluetooth headsets in terms of revenue. It's been picked up broadly throughout our channels. To receiving exceptional product reviews from both editorial reviewers such as CNN and PC Magazine, as well as consumers, and has proven to be an incredible competitive offering for its price point. Demand for the products is very strong, and we are likely be supply constrained for an extended period. Fourth, we continue to make great strategic progress. Besides our market share gains and profitability growth, we have made solid progress on our product pipeline and has some exciting product announcements planned for the fall. Today, we announced an evolution of our Plantronics Spokes software platform by introducing Plantronics Manager Pro version 3.0, a cloud service that customers and partners can use to deploy and manage Plantronics communication devices, as well as a consistent user experience. Also part of this portfolio, the new Plantronics Hub application, helps IT managers rapidly diagnose and resolve client-side Unified Communications deployment issues. We have a good track record of increasing long-term stockholder value and believe we are very well positioned to continue doing so by investing in excellent growth opportunities, leveraging our business model as we grow, and continuously returning cash to shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to Pam to discuss our Q1 results. Pamela J. Strayer: Thanks, Ken. First, an overview of our results. As a reminder, unless stated otherwise, all comparisons of our Q1 fiscal year 2015 financial results are to Q1 of fiscal year 2014. First quarter net revenues were $216.7 million, representing 6.8% growth, non-GAAP operating income of $44.1 million is an increase of $1.7 million or 4%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.78 per share is $0.08 per share higher than the prior year, an increase of approximately 11%. I want to highlight a few key points on our financial results for the quarter. First, our financial results were better-than-expected, with revenue and earnings per share exceeding guidance. We also did better-than-expected on operating margins in the quarter with our Q1 operating margin coming in at 20.4%, just above the low end of our long-term target range of 20%. Second, I'm very pleased with the improvements we are making in the business that are strengthening gross margins. Our gross margin of 53.2% remains above our long-term range of 50% to 52%. Even with the strong increase in revenues from consumer products, which generally have lower margins, our operations and in-house manufacturing expertise provide enormous competitive advantages as the lowest-cost producer of headsets with the highest quality. Our focus on continuous improvement in all areas of the business has resulted in lower cost of goods sold through a variety of efforts, including engineering changes, supplier cost control, improved inventory management, as well as facilities improvements, which drove lower overhead rates due to lower total cost and increased production capacity. Third, we completed the reimplementation of our ERP system during the quarter. We successfully cut over to the new system with limited business impact and are feeling confident about our new platform. This new system will be instrumental in supporting global processes, scaling well to support higher revenues and transactional volumes, improving global data and analytics and reducing our cost of maintenance on the system. Now I'll cover revenue in more detail. Total net revenues for the first quarter of $216.7 million were up $13.9 million, or 6.8% compared to the first quarter last year, most of which was driven by 15% growth in our Europe and Africa region. The E&A region experienced growth in revenues from products in the traditional Office and Contact Center, UC, as well as mobile products. In addition, in the U.S. and the Asia Pac region, we experienced growth in mobile revenues, driven by stronger product portfolio that was well received in the retail market. In addition, U.S. and Asia Pac also saw growth in UC revenues, offset by year-over-year declines in the core Office and Contact Center revenues. Growth in the U.S. and Asia Pac region was approximately 3% and 13%, respectively. The following are key product line comparisons to Q1 last year : Enterprise net revenue of $152.4 million were up roughly $1.2 million and 1%; UC was a driver for that growth with core Enterprise being down year-to-year, due to an unusually strong quarter in the prior year; UC revenues of $49.2 million were up $7.1 million and approximately 17% over Q1 of the prior year; consumer net revenue of $64.3 million were up roughly $12.7 million and 25%, driven primarily by growth in our stereo products, including the introduction of our new BackBeat FIT product. Mobile Bluetooth products also experienced strong growth, aided by the launch of our new Voyager Edge product; growth in revenue from our consumer products was strong across all regions of the world. Non-GAAP gross margin was better-than-expected at 53.2%, that's up 60 basis points compared with last year's margin of 52.6%. Our shift in product mix toward mobile and UC products brought down average product margins by approximately 220 basis points compared to the prior year's gross margin. However, this decrease was more than offset by cost reductions mentioned above, which reduced component costs and overhead rates. In addition, excess and obsolete inventory charges were down by over $1 million compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $71.1 million, up $6.9 million, due primarily to increases in headcount, annual salary increases and increases in variable pay associated with our strong results. In addition, we have higher IT-related spend, primarily associated with our Oracle Go-Live activities and higher legal expenses associated with an ongoing litigation. Offsetting these increases is a benefit of $2 million we recorded in the quarter from a litigation settlement. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 32.8%, that's up 110 basis points from the prior year of 31.7%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 20.4%, down slightly from 20.9% in the prior year. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 27%. As a result of all these items, our Q1 non-GAAP net income of $33 million was 7.8% higher than a year ago, yielding non-GAAP EPS of $0.78, up $0.08 and approximately 11% from last year. Now for some balance sheet and cash flow highlights. We finished the quarter with $437 million in cash and investments on our balance sheet, and generated over $29 million in cash flow from operations during the period. Of the $437 million in cash and investments at quarter end, approximately $11 million was domestic. We used $12.4 million to repurchase shares during the quarter. Our DSO was 63 days, up from 54 days at the end of Q1 of the prior year. The increase was due in part to less time and focus spent during the quarter on customer collection activities as a result of our ERP implementation in the quarter. We estimate that our ERP focus increased DSO by approximately 7 days. In addition, the timing of billings within the quarter added approximately 3 days to our DSO compared to the same quarter in the prior year. It should be noted that we are a book-and-ship model with 48-hour delivery targets. As a result, billings linearity trends are driven by relatively short-term fluctuations in demand and seasonality in our business. Backlog numbers and billings linearity should not be used as an indicator, nor are they reflective of any long-term business trends or significant fluctuations in business demand. Turning to our capital expenditures. Our Q1 investment was approximately $7 million, and slightly over 3% of net revenues. Expenditures include a large deposit on the construction of a new smart working facility in our European headquarters in the Netherlands, Santa Cruz facility improvements and equipment and tooling for our operations. Depreciation expense on a GAAP basis for Q1 was $4.6 million, up $0.6 million from the prior year. Now turning to the outlook. We believe that total net revenues for our second fiscal year -- second fiscal quarter ending in September, will be in the range of $210 million to $220 million. This focus assumes growth -- this forecast assumes gross margins to be approximately flat to slightly up from the current quarter. Depending on revenue mix and other factors, we believe our GAAP operating income will be approximately $35 million to $40 million, and non-GAAP operating income of approximately $42 million to $47 million. The GAAP reconciling items we expect in the second quarter include approximately $7 million in stock-based comp expense and purchase accounting amortization before tax. Although the low end of this non-GAAP operating margin range is just below our long-term targeted range, we do expect to make up for this with a higher profitability in the second half of the year. Our guidance includes an expected spend of approximately $1.9 million on GN litigation in Q2. As a reminder, we are including GN litigation costs as part of our non-GAAP results based in our policy for non-GAAP reporting. The GN lawsuit is in the discovery phase and the impact to operating income from the associated legal expenses is particularly difficult to forecast. Actual expenses can vary significantly from our forecast. Similar to last quarter, included in our non-GAAP guidance is a $2 million benefit to operating expenses, which we will receive as part of a binding agreement with one of our competitors to dismiss litigation. In addition, we've recently settled a second separate lawsuit in our favor. As a result, our non-GAAP guidance also includes this benefit that is expected to be $2.2 million and will be recorded as a reduction to our operating expenses in the second quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter is expected to be 27%, and we are anticipating a full year tax rate of 27%. Based on all of the above, in the second quarter, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.60 to $0.68 per share and non-GAAP EPS to be $0.72 to $0.80 per share, on average diluted shares outstanding of approximately $42.5 million. With that, I'll open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Dave King. David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : I guess, first off, in terms of the guidance -- the revenue guidance, it looks pretty healthy and pretty strong with 11% kind of -- using the midpoint, 11% revenue growth implied. I guess, understanding that you're not breaking it out in the same way going forward in terms of the 4 different segments. But just kind of trying to look for some color, I guess, how should we be thinking about that in terms of Enterprise versus consumer? Particularly amidst what you're seeing on the mobile side and not enough supply necessarily even to meet demand but then, maybe along those lines can, some of your prior comments about expecting a reacceleration in UC, hopefully, as we head into year end, et cetera. Any color would be greatly appreciated. Pamela J. Strayer: Sure. I'm going to handle that question. So first, if you take a look at our Enterprise numbers, we expect that they're going to be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. But if you look at the UC portion of that, that is a pretty growth rate from UC numbers in Q1 of the prior year. On consumer side, Q3 is typically our high watermark for consumer revenues because of the holidays. So that is also baked in to our guidance numbers. S. Kenneth Kannappan : Let me just kind of address part of your question, I think, may have been about kind of the long-cycle build. And we're still believing that. I think that the total ecosystem deployments out there, a significant quantity, are still on IM and presence, with Voice yet to be deployed. In addition to which we have a significant number of companies that are moving forward with pilots proof of concepts, other stages in the process, that we think are going to come on stream, not in the current quarter, and most of it, starting in, even in the next calendar year. So we continue to believe that we're looking at a very significant growth opportunity going forward. David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : That's very helpful, Ken and Pam. And then, I guess, in terms of thinking about the earnings guidance, it sounds like, call it, so that's about 18% growth using the midpoint versus the 11% on the top line, so it seems like some of that's lower share count. It sounds like a little bit of that might be gross margin. But then also, I guess, just some benefit on the expense side. Pam, can you kind of walk us through what the different expense things were again, just real quick? So it sounds like there might be a few things -- still might be a couple of things that are outsized in the second quarter as well, but then also, it may be coming down, too? So any color there would be helpful. Pamela J. Strayer: Yes, so to break it out, I mean, as we've disclosed in the past, we've got $2 million benefits that we're recording in Q2, really, every quarter this year. So there's a $2 million benefit there. There's a new lawsuit that was settled, which adds another $2 million to that. So we've got roughly $4 million, $4.2 million in benefits. If you take those out, our base level of operating expenditures, we're expecting to be up about $2 million from Q1. So we're expecting about $73 million before GN expenses and before the litigation benefit. That increase, quarter-to-quarter, is going to be due primarily to merit increases that kick in, in the second quarter for the full quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from John Bright. John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : So I'll stay with the question, the same amount of question you started with. The OpEx during this quarter was higher than the revenue growth, but it looks like, Pam, that next quarter, that's where we're going be within either at or below revenue growth. Is that a fair statement? Pamela J. Strayer: Yes, that's a fair statement. John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : Okay. Ken, this is more of the philosophical question that you and I had before. Are we at an inflection point, do you think, yet? And you see adoption? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Let's put it this way. If we're saying that, is the growth going to suddenly accelerate at this point, my answer would be not yet. I think that we are going to see growth, but I don't think we've yet hit the point that there's a real change in that growth rate in a positive way. John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : Where do you think we are if you were to call that a baseball game? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Well, honestly, I still think that we are roundabout the first couple of batters in the game. I mean, the fact of the matter is, that most organizations are not using voice UC at this point in time. And I think this is evolving towards heavy soft client voice usage overall. So we've got, my guess is, around 5% or so of knowledge workers' tops using voice UC at this point in time. So there's a tremendous 20x relative to where we are growth. Now again, that's -- some of that's going to take quite some time to adopt. But I think we're going to see the beginning of more substantive [ph] growth over the next 2, 3 years. And I expect to see some of that beginning next year. And then, in the meantime, I think we'll still grow. John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : In the prepared text of Ken, I think it was Ken, might've been Pam, regarding the BackBeat, the new rollout, you mentioned supply constrained for an extended period. Why is the supply constrained? What components may be defined? What would you say an extended period is? And what maybe the expected impacts might be? S. Kenneth Kannappan : So that was my comment, and to be clear, we do have a component in that product. It's an advanced product in a number of ways. And I don't want to identify the component at this point in time, but suffice to say that there is a, unfortunately, a very, very long lead time for that supplier to add capacity. We don't, at this point in time, see an effective alternative to supplement that capacity. And so, we rather quickly ramped beyond their expectations and a little bit beyond our expectations on the product. And so, unfortunately, that is where we'll be for some period. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Latimore. Ryan MacDonald - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : This is Ryan MacDonald on for Michael Latimore. Ken, I believe you talked about, in your opening comments, about -- with UC, there's that -- you sounded pretty hopeful following some of the Microsoft developer conferences and also the Cisco developer partner conferences. Can you talk about how -- the dynamic in that UC business? And is it still predominantly Lync-driven or has Cisco started to become a bigger driver of UC than it was a year ago? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Well, I'm a little reluctant to comment on their businesses. I think that, that's something I should let them do and third-party analysts primarily do. Suffice to say that they are both very important partners for us, and we're continuing to see good business and good partnership with both of them. Ryan MacDonald - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. And for UC revenue, in general, for Plantronics, I mean, was the backlog higher now versus the March quarter? S. Kenneth Kannappan : So -- I'm sorry, that was on UC? Pamela J. Strayer: Yes. S. Kenneth Kannappan : So the trick is we really don't think about backlog the way you do, and let me just kind of explain what I mean by that. At any moment in time, we will have a tiny amount of backlog because customers, typically they don't order from us, they order from typically an SI who's ordering from a distributor who's placing orders on us, and it's all turning very, very quickly. We don't deal with a lot of formal backlog. Now we do have project pipelines that we track for our customers, where they are indicating what the size of their rollout is, what their planned deployment timelines are. Sometimes, we know roughly how much we all get. Often, we don't. Often, they have our products and competitive products on internal websites and people will just select what they want, and we don't necessarily know what's coming to us or the exact timing of it. But even with all of that, I mean, frankly, it's not necessarily accurate. Now, that's definitely not formal backlog. Although, over time, it does turn into business. Ryan MacDonald - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division : Okay. And in terms of, to the extent that you're tracking say, those project pipelines, are you seeing more in terms of like UC deployments, or UC headset deployments, are you seeing -- is there a shift on the way that corporations are deploying those? I mean, are you seeing more corporate-wide deployments? Or is it still mostly on, maybe like a division-by-division basis with large companies? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Well, so -- I mean, companies don't deploy this without an intention to go corporate wide. Having said that, if it's a large company, the ordinary path on that is it does tend to be business unit by business unit. Now it's -- and even within the business units, it's kind of geography by geography. You can understand how that works. If you're in a particular location, it always turns out the surprising amount of communication is with the other people that you work with in a very local manner and the IM tool, and of course, the peer-to-peer voice tools, work very well and people gravitate to them very quickly, the click to call, the conferencing, all that type of stuff. So for a large company, you will always see that pattern go division by division. It's just too monstrous for a huge organization with, say, several hundred thousand people to do a cold turkey, full corporate changeover, it does not ever going to happen that way. Operator : Your next question comes from Tavis McCourt. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : I just want to make sure I understand the OpEx. So this quarter, there was a $2 million gain related to a litigation settlement. And in the next quarter, you expect that to be roughly $4.2 million gain, is that the right way? Pamela J. Strayer: Yes, that's correct. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : And any potential for further gains throughout the year, or is that -- it should be -- that should be the 2 quarters? Pamela J. Strayer: No, that's all we're aware of at this point. S. Kenneth Kannappan : We have mentioned that there would be some gains in Q3 and Q4, right? Pamela J. Strayer: Right. So yes, okay, to clarify, we did mention earlier, we've got gains of $2 million in Q1, $2 million in Q2, and then roughly, $1.6 million in each quarter, Q3 and Q4, related to the settlement that was announced earlier this year. So those are still coming. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay, so for the September quarter guide, it's just a $2 million gain and [indiscernible]. S. Kenneth Kannappan : A total of, well, $4.2 million. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Plus another $1.6 million in December? S. Kenneth Kannappan : That's right. Pamela J. Strayer: Yes. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. Okay, and then on the BackBeat Pro, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of, obviously, it's a great product. I'm just trying to get a sense of the size of that stereo Bluetooth market. You guys have obviously come to become the market leader in Mono Bluetooth. What are the relative sizes of those markets, just so we can kind of, I guess, size the opportunity for that product line? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Sure. I mean, first of all, the markets are only so discrete, by which I mean that the Bluetooth stereo market has a very adjacent market of corded solutions that people often do use with those products. A little less so on the mono side, where the category of corded products has largely evaporated. So it's just worth having that as context. So relative to the Bluetooth-only portion of the stereo market, it is clearly smaller than the Mono market today, but it is growing much more rapidly. And it will become, at some point in time, most likely, larger than the Mono category, if these current trends continue. We also expect over time, that it will pick up a larger portion of that corded stereo market. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Got you. So as of today, a smaller market but growing quite rapidly. S. Kenneth Kannappan : Right. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Yi-Dan Wang. Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I have a few questions. First of all, on the traditional Enterprise sales that you reported, I can see that the comparison is a bit tougher, but the size of the decline seems to be bigger than specially what we had anticipated, and it would be great, Ken, if you could put some additional color around that? And then, let's start with that. S. Kenneth Kannappan : Sure. I really would tell you that I think that it is primarily a function of the year-ago period having been strong, relative to some kind of pent-up upgrade cycles coming out of the recession, as well as some timing issues that just happened to fall that quarter, relative to both deployments and distributors' activities. So that, in my mind, is the primary explanation. Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. I mean, if -- I was kind of looking at the quarterly numbers you've seen in that business, and this is the third quarter that we've seen a fairly sizable decline over the last, I suppose, 6 quarters. Were there anything -- there weren't anything unusual with the currency that would have shifted your reported numbers versus what you would see operationally? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Not really. There weren't big currency swings during that particular period. Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then, I guess, Europe seems to be quite a bit stronger as well. Were there any reasons for that, that we should be aware of? S. Kenneth Kannappan : I think that it's -- at least in my mind, it's -- portions of Europe were, such as the U.K., were experiencing some rebound in economic conditions that allowed for a little bit more replacement of cycle activity. And in some portions where we had a little bit of pickup, I think there is, again, this little bit of pent-up demands are there. Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then, lastly, on the gross margin improvements that you guys have achieved, how much scope is there for further improvements over and beyond what we have seen this quarter? And how long would that last for? Pamela J. Strayer: Yes. So I'd say, in the short to mid term, probably not a lot. We did have lower than what we expect is normal E&O charge, so I would expect that to go back up a little bit next quarter. We'll continue to see some benefit from the lower component cost. But I wouldn't expect any -- another step up from that. So in modeling our gross margin for next quarter, I would call it roughly flat to what we're doing this quarter. Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. So but your gross margin is a decent size above your long-term model, should we expect the current level of gross margin to be sustainable, given that over time, you should see higher Enterprise revenues, which are more profitable than mobile? Pamela J. Strayer: Well, I think... S. Kenneth Kannappan : You know, I mean, we, frankly, are a little bit high, particularly given the higher mix of consumer that we have expected. Having said that, we have continually found opportunities to reduce cost, and those models are based upon our belief of what is long-term structural sustainable. But they're not slavish things that we are necessarily going to operate on, and we're always trying in every area of the company to do better. So that's what we think is long-term sustainable. But it's not that it's necessarily there's anything that's going to change the dynamic immediately. Operator : I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Greg Klaben for his closing comments. Greg Klaben : Thank you very much, Delinah. If anyone has any additional questions, we'll be available after the call. Thanks, again, for joining us. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Jim Fitzgerald Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Operator : Good afternoon, my name is John, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q2 2015 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Greg Klaben, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Greg Klaben : Thanks very much, John. And welcome, everyone, to Plantronics' Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Conference Call. Joining me today are Ken Kannappan, Plantronics' President and CEO; and Pam Strayer, Plantronics' Senior Vice President and CFO. The information presented and discussed today includes forward-looking statements, which are made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The risks and uncertainties related to such statements are detailed in our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and today's press release. For the remainder of today's call, we will be providing only non-GAAP metrics related to gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and earnings per share. We have reconciled these measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly analyst metric sheet, both of which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Additionally, after the conclusion of today's call, a recording of the call will be available with information on our website. Unless stated otherwise, all comparisons of the second quarter fiscal 2015 are to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. Plantronics' second quarter net revenues were $215.8 million. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.65 compared with $0.53 in the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.77 compared with $0.64 in the prior year. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter consists of charges for stock-based compensation and purchase accounting amortization. Please refer to the full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP in our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. S. Kenneth Kannappan : Thanks, Greg. During our second quarter of fiscal 2015, we had 11% top line growth, 19% operating income growth and 20% EPS growth as our operating margins improved. Our strong year-to-year comparison was a result of continued strength in Unified Communications paired with healthy growth in our core product areas. With that backdrop up, I'd like to highlight the following 4 key takeaways from the second quarter. First, we just launched a revolutionary new portfolio context in our products. This portfolio brings the contextual intelligence we pioneered in USB space into the contact center helping our customers solve some major problems. Contact centers, as many of you know, are carefully managed for cost and customer service levels. But there's an old saying that \"if you can't measure it, you can't manage it.\" ACD's capturing management carefully track when customers are put on hold. It is frustrating to customers as well as being expensive time. Agents know this and often use mute instead because it is not reportable. Sometimes this can indicate the need for consultation. They can also be a behavior issue. Either way, contact centers are very interested in capturing the information to improve customer service. We can detect and reports this event to help contact center managers identify new issues rapidly and coach agents. We're working with the major ACD vendors so that they can accept and process these events from our headsets. There're also a range of audio events that can dramatically improve customer service. For example, it is customary for people to occasionally interrupt each other to acknowledge points, particularly over conversation where you can't see each other live. When people are speaking at the same time too much, it's a sign the conversation's broken down. Because we can detect when voice transmission reception are occurring at the same time, we can report this event to quality management systems so the supervisor can assist. A third example in our new products is improved privacy. When an agent leaves their work area, we can see them signal not only to prevent calls from being routed but to put the screen in privacy mode. For contact centers handling sensitive information, be it financial or HIPAA compliance, this is crucial. For agents working at home where the environment is otherwise not monitored and there are concerns over identity theft, it is also essential. These are just some examples of the value add we can provide through contextual intelligence. Our new portfolio is also a breakthrough in its core hits in engineering and design. Our patented third-generation proprietary microphone delivers better noise canceling performance than other products. We have improved our listening performance for challenging incoming calls, such as those from cellphones where poor audio quality and background noise at the speaker's location can make it hard to understand what someone is saying. Wideband audio is also delivered at a time when contact centers are upgrading to new systems which can support this. The hardware itself is extraordinary. Using advanced materials, such as aerospace aluminum, has allowed us to make our headsets 30% lighter and yet even more durable. The comfort and fit are remarkable. You can move the boom without having torque pushing on your ear, and yet it is stable wherever you set it, making it easier to maintain the right position for voice quality. Second, UC continues to be adopted globally by enterprises of all sizes, and headsets continue to be the audio device of choice. Our UC revenues were up 29% year-over-year. The highest growth rate is in part due to a favorable comparison in last year's September quarter. We expect that uneven growth will be the norm in our UC revenues until the market reaches greater maturity. Third, our consumer business continues to do well with 9% year-over-year growth and a year-to-date U.S. consumer market share in mono Bluetooth of a record 50% plus. Our strategic focus on a small portfolio of excellent consumer products continues to yield favorable results and leverages the technology and audio expertise of our Enterprise market. This September, we introduced the BackBeat PRO, our first active noise reduction headset. This uses the relatively common technology from headphones to create sound waves that cancel out background sound. But unlike these headphones, it also includes outstanding audio quality and communications integration. While an extension of our portfolio, it addresses our core customer base. Wired magazine reviewed it as \"better than most\" and notes that it is cheaper with additional communications capabilities as well. We received similarly glowing reviews from PC Magazine, CNET and so on. For all of you on the call today wondering what to buy your loved ones for the holidays, I'd like to recommend the BackBeat PRO. At only $249, it has audio capabilities comparable to higher-priced products and some unique features not found in them. Our product is wireless, and it streams high-definition audio in an extended range of 100 feet using Bluetooth 4.0. You can use it wirelessly for 24 hours or use the cord to connect to an airplane's entertainment system. It also uses our sensors to pause and restart audio when the headphones are removed and put on. And of course, you can also make phone calls. You might want to buy one for everyone on your shopping list. We have a good track record of increasing long-term stockholder value and believe we are very well positioned to continue to do by investing in high-growth opportunities, leveraging our business model as we grow and continuously returning cash to stockholders. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Pam to discuss the financial results. Pamela J. Strayer: Thanks, Ken. First, an overview of our results. As a reminder, unless stated otherwise, all comparisons of our Q2 fiscal year 2015 financial results are to Q2 of the fiscal year 2014. Second quarter net revenues were $215.8 million, representing 11.3% growth; non-GAAP operating income of $45.3 million, an increase of $7.3 million or 19.2%; non-GAAP EPS of $0.77 per share is $0.13 per share higher than the prior year, an increase of approximately 20%. I want to highlight a few key points on our financial results for the quarter. First, we achieved our previously provided guidance for Q2 with solid improvement in margins. We continue to make improvements in our operating margin, both sequentially and year-over-year, largely the result of improved gross margins and a net litigation gain of $1.8 million. Our operating margin for the quarter was 21% compared to 19.6% in the prior year. Excluding the net litigation expense and gain, our operating margin was at 20.2%. However, we are expecting further improvement in the second half of the year. Second, we continue to target higher-operating margins while continuing to make investments to scale of the company with Unified Communications opportunity. Our second quarter gross margin of 54.9% is well above our long-term range of 50% to 52%. Our gross margin is subject to variability quarter-to-quarter. We expect our gross margins to normalize over the course of the year and in the long-term to stabilize in the 50% to 52% range. Third, our operating cash flows remain strong, and our free cash flow will grow over the prior year as our capital expenditures stabilize at roughly 3% of revenue. We focused on improving receivables and improving our DPO, and with continued focus on inventory turns, we're improving our overall cash conversion cycle. Now I'll cover revenue in more detail. Total net revenues for the second quarter of $215.8 million were up $21.8 million or 11.3% compared to the second quarter last year, most of which was driven by a 30% growth in our Unified Communications revenues. We experienced strong growth in revenues from UC products in all of our geographic regions. Revenue growth was also driven by increases in mobile revenues across all regions driven by a strong product portfolio that is well positioned to take advantage of the growth in the consumer stereo headset category. The following are key product line comparisons to Q2 last year : Enterprise net revenues of $156.7 million were up roughly $16.7 million and 12%; UC was the driver for that growth with UC revenues of $47.8 million, up $10.9 million and approximately 30% over the prior year; core Office and Contact Center revenues experienced 6% growth year-to-year against an unusually weak quarter in the prior year; consumer net revenues of $59.1 million were up roughly $5.1 million and 9.4%, driven primarily by growth in our stereo products, including the introduction of our new BackBeat FIT product. Mono Bluetooth products also experienced growth aided by sales of our new Voyager Edge product. Non-GAAP gross margin was better than expected at 54.9%. That was up 260 basis points compared with last year's margin of 52.3%. Our typical downward pressure on gross margins from product mix reversed this quarter compared to the prior year. Our mix of mobile products were flat to down slightly compared to last year. However, the most significant impact on gross margins by far is attributed to cost reductions. These related to product reengineering, volume discounts and lower overhead rates. In addition, [indiscernible] inventory charges were down by over $1 million compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $73.2 million, up $9.8 million due primarily to increases in headcount, annual salary increases and increases in variable pay associated with our strong results. In addition, our legal expenses are up almost $3 million compared to 1 year go associated with ongoing litigation. Offsetting these increases is a benefit of $4.2 million we recorded in the quarter from a litigation settlement. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 33.9%. That's up 120 basis points from the prior year of 32.7%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 21%, up from 19.6% in the prior year. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 27.1%. As a result of all these items, our Q2 non-GAAP net income of $32.9 million was 16.2% higher than 1 year ago, yielding non-GAAP EPS of $0.77 per share, up $0.13 and approximately 20% from last year's Q2 results. Now I'm going to turn to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights. We finished the quarter with $470 million in cash and investments in our balance sheet and generated over $42 million in cash flow from operations during the period. Of the $470 million in cash and investments at quarter end, approximately $26 million was domestic. We used $6.5 million to repurchase shares during the quarter, and we used another $6.5 million for payments to dividends. DSO was 69 days, up from 57 days at the end of Q2 of the prior year. The increase of 2 days was due to a decline in returns reserves compared to the prior year. Now turning to our capital expenditures. Our Q2 investment was approximately $6 million and just under 3% of net revenues. Expenditures include facilities improvements and equipment and tooling for our operations. Depreciation expense on a GAAP basis for Q2 was $4.4 million, up $700,000 from prior year. Now turning to the outlook. We believe total net revenues for our third fiscal quarter ending in December will be in the range of $220 million to $230 million. This forecast assumes gross margins to be down to approximately to 52%, its level comparable to the third fiscal quarter of last year. This is expected as a result of an increase in product mix towards consumer product category we typically see in Q3. Depending on revenue mix and other factors, we believe our GAAP operating income will be approximately $37 million to $42 million and non-GAAP operating income of approximately $45 million to $50 million. The GAAP reconciling items we expect in the second quarter include approximately $8 million in stock-based compensation expense and purchase accounting amortization before tax. As a reminder, we are including GN litigation cost as part of our non-GAAP results based on our policy for non-GAAP reporting. We expect the expenses for this lawsuit will be fully offset by the recognition of a litigation gain that we will record in the quarter related to a binding agreement with our competitors to this business litigation. However, the GN lawsuit is in the discovery phase, and the associated legal expenses are particularly difficult to forecast. Actual expenses can vary significantly from our forecast. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter is expected to be 27% and we're anticipating a full year tax rate of 27%. Based on all of the above, in the second quarter we expect GAAP EPS of $0.64 to $0.72 per share and non-GAAP EPS to be $0.77 to $0.85 per share on average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 42.5 million. With that, we'll open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Bright from Avondale Partners. John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : Ken, it seems that voluntary job turnover is increasing. Would you characterize your Enterprise segment sales as, a, benefiting and, b, beginning to accelerate? That's part one of it. And then as associated with that, you called out the context in our new products, not only in the printed information but also in the prepared text. Is this a refresh you think that could drive -- provide some lift for that segment over the next year or so? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Okay. 2 different questions. So I'm going to try to remember the second one when I get back to it. So let me start with the voluntary turnover. I believe that it has gotten only what I would call a little bit better. The truth is we don't think we've seen much of a rebound in most of the world. So when you talk about where have things improved a little bit, you would say perhaps in the U.S. and the U.K a little bit but not much improvement elsewhere in terms of economic conditions. Within the U.S. and the U.K., we would also say certainly there are hotspots. Silicon Valley is certainly a hotspot where the tech industry has done relatively well and remains a very good market for us. But broadly speaking, if we look at most enterprises, it hasn't gone up significantly. We're nowhere near the levels we were previous session in terms of voluntary turnover of business professionals who tend to be bread and butter in terms of the workforce. So a little bit of improvement but not the kind of dramatic improvement that you would have expected from looking just at the unemployment rates. Labor force participation is still down, and voluntary turnover levels are still not where they were even in the best economies. On the second question, so I think that this is related to the Contact Center portfolio and the business impact that we expect from it. And a couple of things. First of all, we expect this to be the kind of thing that builds over time. Would we expect impact over the course of this fiscal year? Absolutely, we would. But we would expect it to continue beyond that period of time because the contact center purchase cycles are often a little bit longer. John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : Hello? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Yes, that was the end of my answer unless you have another question. John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : No, no, I thought I lost you for a second. Okay. My second question a little bit -- it's more complex. It talks about gross margins and OpEx. One, on the gross margin, you're trending above your long-term model right now. Yet you make a note to say that, again, the long-term model's lower than that, recognizing seasonality in the fourth quarter or in the December quarter. Are you seeing lower-margin sales, gross margin sales to date? Or are you seeing any -- is this just the expected conservatism of price competition as the UC market matures? And I want to pair that question, Ken and Pam, with the OpEx question, i.e., growing your OpEx at or below your revenue growth. Because right now, it seems like you're harvesting your gross margins if we can combine the two. Yet thinking long -term, those -- the gross margins may go down. When are we going to start to see the OpEx stabilize? Pamela J. Strayer: Yes. Thanks, John. I guess you got several questions in there. I'll talk about the gross margins first. So yes, in Q2, we had a slightly lower mix of consumer products, which always helps the gross margin, but we have some significant cost savings as well, and we reengineered some of our core products that give us some cost savings. While those cost savings are fairly broad, they do tend to be stronger in the Enterprise products than in Consumer. And next quarter, we do have a much higher mix of Consumer products. So that's -- the mix is really the primary reason that it declined quarter-over-quarter. For the long-term, we continue to find cost savings wherever we can. As UC becomes a bigger part of our product mix, we do expect that the margins will move towards what we get from the UC products. I'd say the UC gross margin -- the UC product margins in general have been stable for the last 3 years, and I think they're in good shape right now. So it's really a product mix issue primarily over the long term. And we'll take advantage of cost-savings opportunities whenever we can. John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : And the OpEx component of the question. Pamela J. Strayer: Yes. On OpEx, we have been -- we want to go to profitability -- higher profitability this year. We want to let profitability grow with revenues. And we've always plan for a higher lift in profitability in the second half of the year. That's still the case, so our guidance reflects that. Our OpEx quarter-over-quarter is expected to be down so that our profitability will improve in Q3. John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : Last question for me. On the -- and the impact of the onetime, i.e. settlement cost versus legal cost, should we expect about the same balance in Q4? Pamela J. Strayer: No. We had additional gains in Q -- oh, sorry, what quarter were you asking about before ? John F. Bright - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division : In December, I apologize, in December. Pamela J. Strayer: December, yes. In Q2, we had additional gains that aren't going to recur. As I said at the beginning of the year, we do have $1.7 million in gains in Q3 and $1.7 million in gains in Q4 that we'll be recording. But we expect that to be almost entirely offset by litigation expenses. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave King from Roth Capital Partners. David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : I guess, Ken, following up on the -- on some of your comments around the new products in the Contact Center. It looks these may have just launched. With that in mind, can you talk about your expectations for the portfolio? How do you expect it to ramp? And then more importantly, on a near-term basis just how you -- how we should think about this in terms of the -- vis-a-vis December quarter guidance? And then maybe more generally for you, Pam, just in general how should we think about your guidance by the 3 kind of segments, call it, Enterprise, UC and Consumer? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Okay. I'm going to try to answer your question, and then if I'm not on target, feel free to redirect me. So first of all, these are not going to have a huge impact in the December quarter. A good deal of this is not really significantly shipping during this particular quarter. And in general, we see in the contact center that customers frequently want to trial these products for a period of time. Some of the integrations will take time to be completed with our partners. And so this is a little bit more long cycle. We've also been asked the question as to whether this is going to have a negative effect because of the announcement of negatively impacting current period shipments and people delaying their purchases. We don't believe that would be the case either. So we think that there will be a very small benefit in the current quarter from those but not significant. Was there any other question on the current quarter in relation to these products and revenue that you wanted from me? David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : Not on the current quarter. That helps a lot. But maybe just the outlook in general and how you expect these products to contribute? How significant is it in terms of the context of your overall OCC business and what are you thinking for it longer term? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Sure. Well, the contact center is -- has always been a important part of our business. It's always been a blurred one. I mean it's not really a segment in some respects because you have the same customers through the same channels buying the same products going to different floors in the same building. Nonetheless, it's a meaningful and important business to us. I think that the portfolio is very well timed. As I mentioned, a lot of these organizations are trying to get deeper and deeper into analytics, and the new systems that the providers are offering have greater analytics capability. And as we're enabling them with even more information, it's allowing contact centers to be able to see a vision that they can materially improve both the customer experience, the engagement that they get with the customer, the agent management and other information to really improve it. So there's a lot of things that come together very, very well for us in this portfolio. We have a very significant installed base that therefore represents a big long-term opportunity for upgrade. David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : Great. That helps. S. Kenneth Kannappan : And then I think there's another part of your question related to financial. I think I'll let Pam answer. Pamela J. Strayer: Yes. You had some questions about Q3 guidance? David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : Yes. Just by segment, then in terms of how we should think about Enterprise and the few components there and also... Pamela J. Strayer: Yes, so we don't usually provide details here. I guess what I would say is mobile has been strong for us this year generally. If you look at a Q2 to Q3 increase in mobile revenues, it's typically pretty strong, 20% or something like that. I think it'll be a little bit lower this year quarter-over-quarter sequentially just because we've had such strong bookings throughout Q2 in mobile. Year-over-year for UC, we do expect growth there. North of 20% quarter-over-quarter there will be growth. But OCC overall, we're thinking flat. It's a forecast. It's inherently flawed. And it's our best guess at this point. David M. King - Roth Capital Partners, LLC, Research Division : Sounds good. That's helpful. And then maybe just switching gears a bit, Pam, in terms of working capital and managing that. Obviously, you've had some progress on the inventory side that you've -- that you've highlighted. It looks like you're also having a fair amount of success in managing payables a little bit better. Can you talk about maybe what's driving both of those things and just the outlook for opportunities on the working capital front going forward? And I'll step back. Pamela J. Strayer: Sure, yes. So for the long term, we do think that -- we are focused very heavily on inventory management and inventory turns, and our operations team has already done some fantastic work there. We've got a culture of continuous improvement. We'll continue to work on that over the longer term and hope to make some improvement there over the next couple of years. But on the DPO side, really that improvement is just primarily a result of focusing on it. And I think there might be a little bit more that we can do there as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Coster from JPMorgan. Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Ken, perhaps you can talk a little bit about the -- what you're seeing in terms of end markets by region? What color can you provide there? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Sure. Well, first of all, we're seeing what I would call overall healthier global conditions than one would've expected by reading the newspapers. But having said that, it's not robust. It's just healthy. So I would say that with the exception of a few markets -- I mean, Venezuela, Argentina, Ukraine certainly, come to mind where, obviously, sales is severely impaired -- we're seeing broadly reasonably healthy business conditions. I would say that within Europe, the U.K. remains the brightest spot. And the U.S. economy is certainly continues to be pretty solid for us. India, the Asian markets is right now the strongest. Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then can you just remind us what your intentions are with the international cash that you've got parked out there around the world? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Sure. Our primary intention is that we believe repatriation is going to happen at some point in time. It's certainly what we hear whether that turns out to be at some point in time in 2015 as a part of a tax deal or goes to 2017. We can't be sure. But we think that the odds have been rising as there seems to be a majority in Congress that favors something. We do not want to repatriate and pay the tax given the possibility of something like that occurring. And we believe that there's a lot of good economic arguments for repatriation and that it's likely to occur and that most companies will leave that cash over there. So that, that huge stimulus effect that would come is something that we think that the government's going to want to take advantage of. Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. Great. And then last question to Pam really, I just need a point of clarification here. In the second half of the fiscal year, you're looking for a little bit of leverage out of growth the operating income -- operating margin line. Is that just simply a function of growth? Or is it a seasonal thing? Should we sort of plan on this being the shape of your sort of margins, your operating margins every year, the second half will be stronger than the first? Pamela J. Strayer: I'd say it's probably a little bit of both. We do tend to have a strong Q3 and Q4 quarter. And therefore, it's a better time for us to try and increase profitability. But there's also just some timing differences in when expenses are falling this year, the timing of the litigation expenses and when those are falling, which is a big chunk of expense for us. So I don't know that I'd make a general statement that this is going to be the new norm going forward. No, not to this degree anyway. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt from Raymond James. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : I guess, first of all, in terms of timing of the GN litigation expenses, any reasonable chance that this would last into fiscal '16? Or is it reasonably certain that this will pretty much get cleaned up in '15? S. Kenneth Kannappan : No, we would expect that it's most likely to last into fiscal '16 than not. We don't control the timing on it. And we can't be certain. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then, Pam, I want to make sure I kind of understood some of the puts and takes in December guidance. Did I hear you correctly, gross margin of 52%? Pamela J. Strayer: Yes. I'm just looking at the gross margin that we recorded 1 year ago in Q3. Our bottoms-up forecast supports that with a heavy mix towards Consumer. That's likely where we'll land. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. So if I build in kind of a slightly stronger year-over-year growth in Consumer than Enterprise, it's more of a kind of a flattish trend in Enterprise on a sequential basis. Is that the right way to look at it? Pamela J. Strayer: Yes. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : And is there anything that happened unique in September that would kind of -- that is not -- that hasn't been the seasonal norm, obviously, the last couple of years. I was just wondering is there's anything you're seeing or anything unique that happened in September that would lead you to believe that? Or just kind of early in the quarter so you might as well make it flattish? Pamela J. Strayer: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question. Anything in the last quarter? Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : The last couple of years in the December quarter, the Enterprise business has actually been up quite nicely. And so I'm just wondering was there -- is there kind of a greater logic behind the kind of flattish Enterprise in December this year, either some things went specially well in September or something you're seeing in October so far leads you to that forecast versus the last couple of years, where I think last year December Enterprise was up $7 million? The year before that December Enterprise was up $6 million or so. S. Kenneth Kannappan : So let me answer the question. I mean, there is -- I would say that it's more likely that other periods are anomalies than our forecast, but there is nothing unique about the forecast. We do base it on what I would call all of the data that we have, and it is intent to be our best guess. The data that we have includes the patterns of all prior periods, month-by-month, third [ph] Quarters. It includes the knowledge that we have of pipelines. There are some random lumpinesses that have occurred in various periods. We almost never forecast unforeseen large blue birds or unforeseen large black birds, so to speak, and the timing of things can move in and out of particular quarters. But we think on balance, this is a fairly reasonable forecast. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Makes sense, Ken. And then so if I put kind of the midpoint of your revenue range in there and bring the gross margins down to 52%, it's a reasonably meaningful decline on a nominal basis in operating costs sequentially. And this being kind of the holiday season, typically we see an uptick in SG&A, at least. I guess what are the offsets to that this year that are leading to that OpEx decline in the December quarter? Pamela J. Strayer: Well, if you look at the sequential change September to December quarter, one of the big declines we're expecting is in legal expense. But we've also made some conscious decisions to cut some costs to increase our profitability in the second half. So that's where we're landing. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And are those decisions -- I guess would those be flowing through going forward? Or are those kind of onetime decisions on advertising and the like? S. Kenneth Kannappan : I would call it more timing of expenses and what we're trying to do rather than a -- something that you should necessarily extrapolate on. I think that the best guidance we could give you on expenses is more that we look at it primarily on an annual basis, that we set a plan and that we are -- sometimes we've been wrong where we thought revenues were going to be higher than they were, and so we had more expense growth as a result and we didn't want to correct right away. What we are looking to do though is to improve in F '16 our operating margin a little bit by trying to set a plan where the revenues, and more particularly, the gross profit will grow a little bit faster than the operating expenses as we seek to improve that operating margin back closer towards the 21%, 21.5% point of the -- of our range. So I wouldn't get too focused on the quarter but more look at the long-term goal that we have. And that's where we're going to be trying to set things. Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : I got the message. And then just to be clear, the GN litigation expenses to some degree will likely trail into fiscal '16, but the litigation gain will all be recognized this year, this fiscal year. Is that correct? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Yes, that's correct. And we are hopeful that it won't go all the way through fiscal '16 for those litigation expenses, but we can't be certain. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Latimore from Northland Capital Markets. Jim Fitzgerald : This is Jim Fitzgerald sitting in for Mike Latimore. So my first question is regarding sales cycles. I wanted to see if you could comment a little bit on how sales cycles are changing for your UC products. S. Kenneth Kannappan : Well, I don't really think that they have changed significantly, certainly not since our last call. Jim Fitzgerald : Okay. And then secondly, so you have new headphones, new Contact Center products out. What would really be the next features or the next products of emphasis for you guys going forward? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Gosh, I'm not 100% sure how to answer that question. We're -- we have what I described as a rich pipeline across the business and as well as some new areas that we're experimenting in, in addition to what I would call capability, software firmware integrations, that we're doing, and there's not any particular thing that I want to disclose at this time. Jim Fitzgerald : Okay. And then lastly, I might have missed this, I apologize if I did, but -- so your headset business has increased sequentially during the past 2 years in December quarters. So do you expect that to occur again this year? S. Kenneth Kannappan : Well, when you say the headset business, I mean, I assume you're referring to the Enterprise portion of it? Jim Fitzgerald : Yes. S. Kenneth Kannappan : So we're sticking with our forecast, which -- and the question was kind of asked a little bit, which is fine, but the answer we gave is that we really look at these longer-term patterns try to forecast as best as we can based upon the data that we have, which includes all the specific plans whereas sometimes timings move in and move out. But we think our forecast is reasonable. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Yi-Dan Wang from Deutsche Bank. Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : First of all, I have a clarification question regarding the Enterprise headset sales in the December quarter. Did you guys say that, that would be flattish compared to the absolute numbers that you reported in the quarter just finished? And then the second question is, your competitors move to give distributors higher rebate rates soon after you announced during the Contact Center portfolio. So the question is, how has that played out in the market so far? How have you guys responded to it? If you could provide some color on that, that would be helpful. S. Kenneth Kannappan : Well, I'll take the second question. But I'll let you go ahead with the first one, Pam. Pamela J. Strayer: Yes. So Yi-Dan, I think you're asking about total OCC or Enterprise revenues which, yes, we're, forecasting right now about to be flat Q3 to Q4. We did have an increase from Q3 to Q4 last year, but other years, it's been flat. So that's our best guess at this point. S. Kenneth Kannappan : As to the competitive activity, I really think it'd be better them comment on how well they think it's worked out for them. I would say that what -- from our end, we've had tremendous interest in our new portfolio, and we think people are really, really excited about what that offers. Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : So have you seen any negative impacts on your business from that? S. Kenneth Kannappan : If you ask a question like that, then the answer would almost by definition wind up being yes. Because even if I had more positives that offset the negatives, the answer would be in the affirmative. But the reality is I think that most of the market is really focused on our new offer and what it has to provide to organizations in terms of improved performance, customer experience, et cetera. And so I don't think that people are primarily focused on that. Yi-Dan Wang - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. So in terms of your response then, have you had to give any pricing away to address that? Or do you think your products are strong enough that you don't need to do any of that? S. Kenneth Kannappan : So really, I'm very conscious of that fact, Yi-Dan, that we're in a litigation right now on the contact center, and you're asking questions about contact center market and pricing. And I've tried to be as expansive as I can be, which is we really think that our product value here is very strong and being very well received in the market. And I'm sorry, but I just kind of want to leave that at that. Operator : There are no additional audio questions. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters. Greg Klaben : Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'll be available afterwards if anyone has any follow-up questions. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 Fiscal Year 2015 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Greg Klaben, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Greg Klaben : Thanks very much, Blaire. And welcome, everyone, to Plantronics' Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Conference Call. Joining me today are Ken Kannappan, Plantronics' President and CEO; and Pam Strayer, Plantronics' Senior Vice President and CFO. The information presented and discussed today includes forward-looking statements, which are made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The risks and uncertainties related to such statements are detailed in our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and today's press release. For the remainder of today's call, we will be providing only non-GAAP metrics related to gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, and EPS. We have reconciled these measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly analyst metric sheet, both of which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website.  Additionally, after the conclusion of today's call, a recording of the call will be available with information on our website. Unless stated otherwise, all comparisons of the third quarter financial results are to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. Plantronics' third quarter net revenues were $231.8 million. Plantronics' GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.71 compared with $0.80 in fiscal 2014. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.79 compared with $0.76 in the prior year. The differences between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter consists of charges for stock-based compensation, purchase accounting amortization, releases of tax reserves, and the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Please refer to the full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP in our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken Kannappan : Thanks Greg. Before I review the highlights of the quarter from a business standpoint, I would like to mention two items that are negatively affecting our March quarter guidance. The first and smaller one is the timing of the beginning and end to the March quarter, which has an approximately $4 million impact to revenue in the quarter because this Q4 starts early giving it weaker sales days between Christmas and New Year's instead of stronger sales days at the end of March. The second one is the impact of exchange rates on our revenue and profitability. With nearly half of our revenues from outside the U.S., the recent and rampant currency fluctuations have the potential to reduce our dollar revenues as much as the Euros revenue growth. The effect on income is larger as most of our costs, both product and operating expenses, are in dollars. But we do have some offsetting local currency expenses. The effect here could be as high as 18 months of operating profit growth. In the past, we have not highlighted currency as a great deal because movements have generally been slower and our growth is intended to make the impacts in a period relatively small. In addition, our currency hedging has offset a large portion of this short term effects. Pam will cover our hedging approach in more detail.  While we hope that the devaluation of the Euro and other currencies, lower oil prices and other actions like these -- stimulus will help Europe and other regions with an economic recovery that will also lead to currency appreciation and a boost to our earnings. For now, our earnings are simply lower due to the FX rates. From this space, there is no adverse change to our strategic position or growth prospects which remain excellent. There could be an opportunity for recovery of the negative FX impact overtime. We will manage our business to optimize for our long-term competitiveness over current period results.  During our third quarter of fiscal 2015, we achieved 9% top line growth driven by 24% growth in our Unified Communications revenues, 4% growth in our core enterprise revenues, and 6% growth in our consumer revenues. Against that backdrop, I\u2019d like to highlight the following four key takeaways from the third quarter. First, despite significant currency headwinds, growth in our operating income was comparable to revenue growth at 10%. EPS was slower at up 4% principally due to a balance sheet loss due to FX and other income. Our operating expenses grew at a slower rate than revenue.  Second, the Unified Communications opportunity continues to grow now and now represents a third of our enterprise revenue. While we continue to expect uneven growth quarter to quarter in UC, we expect healthy growth this calendar year. Given the increasing proportion of enterprise revenues coming from UC revenue along with the challenge in determining if our UC products are being used in UC environments or being purchased as future proved solutions, we plan to discontinue UC revenue reporting beginning with this year\u2019s June quarter. This in no way implies diminished view of the UC market.  Third, our product portfolio is extremely fresh and we have exciting new products on the way this calendar year. Our new portfolio focuses on the contact center and other intensive users have been exceptionally well received. We also believe we have outstanding portfolios in UC and Mono Bluetooth. Our efforts to extend from communications into related lifestyle segments for business professionals have also been very well received.  Our new stereo, Bluetooth products have already grown to about a quarter of our consumer revenues from relatively low levels last year. Our BackBeat PRO wireless active noise cancelling stereo headphones and BackBeat FIT fitness focus wireless ear buds both earned 2015 Consumer Electronics Show Innovation Awards or CES in the headphones product category.  Fourth, we continue to be recognized for operational excellence and continue to focus on quality and improving performance throughout Plantronics. In January, Mexico\u2019s President presented us with two major awards, the first is the national quality award, the highest distinction for organizational excellence in Mexico. Similar to the Malcolm Balridge Award in the United States, this award recognizes companies and institutions that had achieved the highest standards of quality, operational performance, and competitiveness, and improving their commitment to sustainable development in the well-being of the community. Plantronics won this award in 2004, this is the first year we applied since then. This is a particularly notable achievement giving the increasing complexity of our business over the past 10 years. In addition to assembling our headsets, Plamex associates are working on helping design and produce software and firmware in an entirely different manufacturing infrastructure and plant than in the past. The Mexican government also gave us a brand new award called the Distinction to a Journey of Excellence that honors a company\u2019s \"consistency and commitment to continuous improvement in innovation throughout its history, high performance results, extraordinary commitment to the community, and organizational culture that warrants its competitiveness and long-term sustained development\". In the past we have won numerous national and international awards in Mexico and elsewhere including the National Technology Award, National Logistics Award, National Labor Award and National Export Award. Plamex has also won the great place to work competition in Mexico over the last four years in a row including this year.  In addition Plamex won the only award the United States gives international operations of U.S. companies, the award for corporate excellence in 2014. We are continuing to improve this outstanding operation with new initiatives in lead manufacturing, increasing automation, and implementing a new manufacturing execution system. We are beginning this year with a more efficient, more innovative, and more agile competitive company. We believe our position is as strong as ever. With that I\u2019ll turn over the call Pam to discuss our Q3 results in more detail. Pamela Strayer : Thanks Ken. First an overview of our results. As a reminder, unless stated otherwise, all comparisons of our Q3 fiscal year 2015 financial results are to Q3 of the fiscal year 2014. Third quarter net revenues were $231.8 million, representing 9% growth. Non-GAAP operating income of $48.1 million, an increase of $4.2 million or 9.6%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.79 per share is $0.03 higher than the prior year, an increase of approximately 4%.  Given the significant impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements, particularly those of the Euro and British pounds to the U.S. dollar, I will be giving year-over-year growth rates of some key indicators both as reported and as they would have been had FX rates remained consistent with the same quarter in the prior year. I will refer to these as constant currency basis.  I want to highlight a few key points in our financial results for the quarter. First, we achieved 9% revenue growth and 10.9% on a constant currency basis. Our revenue growth was primarily a result of 10% growth in enterprise revenues, driven by UC growth of 24%. Our total net revenue growth rates were comparable in all of our major geographies.  Second, our operating margins remained solidly in our target range with record operating income and improved EPS, despite the increasingly negative impact from a strengthening dollar during the quarter. Our operating income increased by 19.6% year-over-year, a bit better than our revenue growth. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew by 14%.  Third, we continued to target an improvement in our operating margin for fiscal 2016, excluding GN litigation expenses. But currency headwinds may constraint a meaningful improvement.  Now I will cover revenue in more detail. Total net revenues for the third quarter of 231.8 million were up 19.1 million or 9% compared to third quarter last year. On a geographic basis, we recorded year-over-year revenue growth of 8% to 11% in all regions. Defying [ph] our key product line comparison to Q3 of last year and applied net revenues of $161.6 million were up roughly $15 million and 10.2%. UC was the principal driver for that growth with UC revenues of $53.5 million, up 10.3 million and 24% over the prior year. Core office and contact center revenues experienced 4% growth, driven primarily by the Asia Pac region and the U.S. Consumer net revenues of $70.2 million were up roughly $4.1 million and 6.2%, driven primarily by growth in our stereo products. Non-GAAP gross margin was 52% relatively flat compared with last year's 52.2% margin.  In the prior year, we recorded a one-time benefit to cost of goods sold to correct accounting for products, warranty, and return. This adjustments improved our prior year gross margin by 113 basis points. Excluding this benefit, gross margins would have increased by 90 basis points year-over-year. In the current quarter despite a high mix of UC and consumer product revenues, our gross margins were strong due primarily to material cost savings and a lower charge for excess and obsolete inventory. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $72.5 million, up $5.4 million due primarily to increases in head count. In addition our legal expenses are up almost 2 million compared to one year ago associated with ongoing litigation. Offsetting these increases is a benefit of $1.7 million recorded in the quarter from a litigation settlement.  As a percentage of revenue operating expenses were 31.3% down 20 basis points from the prior year of 31.5%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 20.8%, relatively flat compared to 20.7% in the prior year. When you exclude GN litigation expenses of $1.9 million and exclude the unusual litigation gains we recorded this quarter, the operating margin would have been 20.9%. This is in our long-term operating model range of 20% to 23%. While our revenues and operating income grew 9%, our net income only grew 2% as a result of foreign currency losses recorded and other income and expense related to our balance sheet accounts. We recorded a loss of $2.6 million net of gains recorded from a hedging program. Our non-GAAP profit before tax increased 4.5% over the prior year. On a constant currency basis, profit before tax increased by approximately 15% over the prior year. Now I am going to tell you a few notes on our hedging program. There are a few components, one for the balance sheet and one for the P&L. For the balance sheet we hedged one month out against the forecasted assets and liabilities denominated in Euros, British pounds, and Australian dollars to protect our cash flows from those items. The largest foreign denominated accounts are accounts receivable and some operating cash balances. These hedged gains and losses are met against the economic gains and losses on these accounts in other income and expense which are below the operating margin line and are not included in our operating income results. However, they do impact our EPS. Our goal is to reduce the impact of short-term FX movements on assets and liabilities between the tender earned or incurred and the time they are settled. Our losses experienced in other I&E this quarter is a result of unhedged currencies as well as using a hedge of less than 100% on hedged currencies. These gains and losses are typically within normal levels but have not been significant enough for us to highlight them in the past.  And now onto the P&L. Our hedging philosophy in the P&L is to reduce volatility in our operating income for planning purposes and we do that by locking in a narrow range of rates one year into the future. We hedge against the estimated revenue expense items denominated in Euros and pounds by using dollars to limit volatility while keeping these hedges more cost effective. Therefore we average hedges for our current March quarter during Q4 of FY14. We have therefore put some protection in place for operating income results but will begin losing that protection in the quarter ending September when rates begin to move significantly. It\u2019s important to note that we do not hedge 100% of our estimated exposure in these currencies because over hedging has a longer term negative impact on our accounting should we get the forecast along.  I have describe the impact from having our reporting currency in U.S. dollars, however, Ken has stated earlier, the stronger dollar has negative impacts to our business that are not easily quantified and cannot be hedged against such as the impacts to our top line growth and our gross margins in foreign countries where we sell in U.S. dollar. Product pricing maybe impacted and other concerns exists, for instances we deferred revenue this quarter from our business in Russia due to concerns about collectability.  Our effective non GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 27%. We recorded the benefit related to reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in December. Similar the last time this happened we booked three fourths of this credit for the GAAP only results, the benefit related directly to the December quarter is recorded in our non-GAAP results for the December quarter. The tax rate has remained at 27% for the full year on a non-GAAP basis as this tax credit savings was offset by a mix of income towards higher tax geographies.  As a result of all these items our Q3 non-GAAP net income of $33.6 million was 2% higher than a year ago, yielding non-GAAP EPS of $0.79, up 3 pennies and approximate 4% from last year\u2019s Q3 results. We estimate currency movements versus the prior year reduced our EPS results by $0.10 per share on this December quarter.  Now on the balance sheet and cash flow highlights, we finished the quarter with 484 million in cash and investments on our balance sheet and generated over 28 million in cash flow from operations during the period. Of the 448 million in cash and investments at quarter end, approximately $41 million was domestic. We used $8.5 million to repurchase shares during the quarter, and we used another $6.5 million for payments to dividends.  DSO was 61 days, up 5 days compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to billing linearity, specifically a higher percentage of our business done in the second half of the quarter when compared to one year ago. This linearity is primarily related to when the Holidays fall relative to the end of our fiscal quarter. Turning to our capital expenditures, our Q3 investment was approximately $6 million and 2.5% of net revenues. Expenditures include facilities improvements and equipment and tooling for our operations. We expect capital expenditures in Q4 to be a little higher anywhere from $8 million to $10 million. Total CAPEX for FY16 is expected to be $35 million to $40 million, approximately $9 million of that is related to our new headquarter facility in the Netherlands. Depreciation expense for Q3 was $4.8 million, up $1.1 million from the prior year. Turning to the outlook, we believe total net revenues for our fourth fiscal quarter ending in March will be in the range of $205 million to $215 million. This forecast assumes gross margins to be around 53.5%, the same as last year\u2019s Q4. At the midpoint of this revenue range we would show a year-over-year growth rate of 0.4%, however, on a constant currency basis the growth rate built into our revenue guidance will be 2.9%.  Depending on revenue mix and other factors, we believe our GAAP operating income will be approximately $32 million to $37 million and non-GAAP operating income will be approximately $40 million to $45 million. The GAAP reconciling items we expect in the fourth quarter include approximately $8 million in stock-based compensation expense and purchase accounting amortization before tax. As a reminder, we are including GN litigation cost as part of our non-GAAP results based on our policy for non-GAAP reporting. We are forecasting Q4 expense associated  with this litigation to be approximately $1.5 million. We expect the expenses for this lawsuit will be fully offset by the recognition of a litigation gain that we expect to report in the quarter related to a binding agreement with one of our competitors to dismiss litigation. However, the GN lawsuit is in the discovery phase, and the associated legal expenses are particularly difficult to forecast. Actual expenses can vary significantly from our forecast. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter is expected to be 27%. Based on all of the above, in the fourth quarter we expect GAAP EPS of $0.55 to $0.63 per share and non-GAAP EPS to be $0.67 to $0.75 per share on average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 43 million. We estimate the currency exchange rates will have a negative impact to our non-GAAP EPS guidance of approximately $0.05 per share.  Our business fundamentals and market position are solid and we estimate that the combined impact of foreign exchange headwinds and the timing of sales days in the quarter account for nearly the entire delta between the guidance we are providing and what would have been a very good March quarter. With that we will open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Dave King from Roth Capital. Your line is open. Dave King : Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. I guess first I appreciate all the color on some of the currency impacts. I just had one point of clarification. Did I hear you correctly Pam that the guidance for the March quarter assumes 2.9% year-over-year growth in constant currency, is that what you said and then maybe just generally speaking, Ken can you just talk about what's happening as a result of currency, are you starting to see any weaker demand as a result of it in some of the markets where you do sell in dollars, etc., and then I guess which is -- I will start there, thanks? Ken Kannappan : So, let me let Pam cover the first part of that and I will\u2026 Pamela Strayer : Yes, so the answer is yes. I said 2.9% year-over-year growth adjusted to constant currency. Ken Kannappan : So, other than that, let me just say that honestly that we -- the only other real effect on this March quarter which I mentioned which does effect the growth rate that Pam outlined is that the quarter is a little bit shifted, so that results in somewhat weaker days this quarter than a year ago. I would say that in general what we have seen so far is that the pattern of demand is following our normal seasonal pattern of demand. It is still early in the quarter, so forecasts are never known for certain but that's what we believe we\u2019ve seen.  I would say that there are going to be winners and losers in the economic environment as there always are. Certainly, we have already seen some impact from what I would call -- oil economies and/or oil companies where particularly contract drilling and other firms that have got a sharper impact from it, but at the same time, there are going to be beneficiaries from the changed environment, so as it relates to the dollar itself, we are generally selling in most major markets in local currency, so the effect for us is not that people are necessarily buying less as a result of the currency becoming cheaper to the dollar, the effect for us is one of -- we realized slightly lower revenue and much sharper to lower profits. Dave King : Okay, that helps. And then maybe thinking about it in terms of the various businesses, that guidance maybe used in constant currency to kind of keep it fairly neutral [indiscernible], can you talk about what the guidance assumes sort of by business line, enterprise, the two components and then the consumer business? Pamela Strayer : Sure, I will start with the OCC business. It really does assume a relatively flat year-over-year growth rate. We are forecasting UC revenues to be in the high teens in our growth rate year-over-year. On the consumer side, I don\u2019t have those right in front of me\u2026 Ken Kannappan : Yes, Dave both consumer and enterprise gets affected equally by the currency headwinds we are facing. There is not a greater effect in either of the product lines in those categories. Dave King : Okay. Thanks for the color off the back. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt from Raymond James. Your line is open. Tavis McCourt : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Pam I just want to make sure I understood your comment regarding the P&L hedging. You made a comment that you hedged one year in advance. I want to make sure I heard that right, and if so if the differences between the recognized revenue and constant currency revenue, are those the differences assuming that you had no hedging program at all or what is that, I guess, what I am getting at is are you feeling the burden of the $1.13 [euro] today or is that something that you will feel in the future because you are hedging today for one year out? Pamela Strayer : Yeah, so we do hedge one year out. The constant currency numbers that I disclosed take a look at what we expect to be the FX currency impact in our revenue offset by our current hedges that we have outstanding, so the hedging gains are both considered in that. So, what\u2019s the next FX impact for revenues. If we had -- one of the challenges as I said earlier as we don\u2019t hedge 100% so we are still going to have some exposure there. Tavis McCourt : Okay, so if all the hedges weren\u2019t there, it\u2019d be much worse, this is the net of the hedging activity because you don\u2019t hedge on it -- I got it. Pamela Strayer : Yes. Ken Kannappan : But let me make one comment, the balance sheet losses are kind of a one-time phenomenon as you go down. Once you are at a steady level, then you wouldn\u2019t incur any balance sheet losses. Tavis McCourt : Yes, that I understand, and for the March quarter guide have you guys assumed any balance sheet losses? Ken Kannappan : We have assumed a balance sheet loss there as well as the -- from the start of our quarter by the time we did the forecast, the currencies had depreciated further. Tavis McCourt : Yes. Pamela Strayer : Just to give you some perspective on that. I mean, the Euro has declined about 8% since the end of December and about 11% since the end of September. Tavis McCourt : Yes, I suspect most of us are aware on the call. My other question Ken is, last year I think your consumer business was held up a bit by some component tightness in some of your Bluetooth wireless skews, one or some I forget, but is there anything as you look into planning for this Holiday year in the consumer business, any component tightness that you see as a potential or do you think that will be a little better executed? Ken Kannappan : So, let me explain that one actually, there was a single product only, and to be precise it was our BackBeat FIT, for which we had a component limitation and long and short that the forecast significantly exceeded the capacity of one of our suppliers, and they were simply not in a position to raise their production in any reasonable timeframe, and it was not effective to redesign the product which was heavily dependent upon the unique performance of that component. And that situation has persisted and continues to persist. There are no real limitations we have on any of our other products other than normal kind of startup effects that involve new products as we are ramping them up. So that\u2019s a one-off unique to that particular product. It remains capacity constrained, and we have not been able to release it to all channels that were interested in that product. Ultimately, that will get fixed in the future, but that is a continuing item which we knew would be long standing. Tavis McCourt : Got you and then last question on the GN litigation expenses and the offsetting gains, is the March quarter the last quarter of the offsetting gains and any update on the visibility of how long this discovery process will last with the GN litigation? Ken Kannappan : So let me go ahead with that, yes, this is the last quarter of the offsetting gains from that item. We don\u2019t really have any visibility. We have to assume that this will continue unless the other party decides that it\u2019s not productive for them to pursue it or it finally reaches a summary judgment or other trial conclusion. Tavis McCourt : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Coster from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Paul Coster : Thanks for taking my question. The first one Pam, I think I heard you say that gross margins would be around 53.5% in the next quarter, March quarter is that correct and if it is correct how does that reconcile with Ken\u2019s comment about sharply lower margins owing to the hit you are taking on sales into international markets at the moment? Pamela Strayer : So I did say 53.5%, that\u2019s what\u2019s baked into our forecast right now. It\u2019s kind of unknown and difficult to quantify what the pricing impact might be in Q4. So yes, I mean there might be some pressure that we experience there. I want to remind you that we do have hedges on our peso which protect some of our cost of goods sold and margins. Paul Coster : Okay. Second question is the 2.9% growth on those constant currency basis also it\u2019s a little bit difficult to reconcile with the overall CAGR that you\u2019re expensing from 13 through 18 based upon your presentation material pages 12 and 13 for instance which are pointing to 13% overall CAGR growth 17% to 18% growth in the enterprise, why are we disconnected from that kind of growth rate at the moment? Ken Kannappan : Okay, there is a couple of things going on, the first one is again this particular quarter, the March quarter does have a slight timing negative which accounts for a portion but not the entire amount of that. The second one is that at least in my mind the negative impacts are falling quicker than the positive ones as the economy shifts a little bit. So we have in fact had a number of customers that have had to cancel plans that were severely affected by the economic issues and again I refer to particularly the oil related industries. And so I think that\u2019s another thing that has affected it. Paul Coster : Okay, got It. Thanks very much. Ken Kannappan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Burns from Sidoti & Company. Your line is open. Gregory Burns : Yeah, so the question about the new portfolio of UC, I mean our conference center products just wanted to maybe get a little color on the acceptance you are seeing in the market and maybe you\u2019re seeing a little bit of a beginnings of an upgrade cycle from those new products? Ken Kannappan : Yes, I think we are getting a tremendously positive reception. Now these products tend to ramp more slowly than you see in other parts of our business as in general people take some time to test them, to assure themselves of the durability and longevity as they\u2019re used in both contact centers and other intensive applications where people are very, very, very job dependent upon the item. I think also in this case there are going to be some integrations which will take a little bit of time to be completed with partners. So we expect a long ramp as we often see in this space but again the initial responses is extremely positive. Gregory Burns : Okay and I guess CSU brought out Wearable Concept 2, with these concepts headsets what is the strategy there, are you \u2013 the challenges built-in headsets, is there a roadmap to bring them, launch them commercially in your broader headset line, like what is the strategy behind kind of these concept headsets in bringing those technologies and functionalities to market? Ken Kannappan : So one of the things that we\u2019ve learned in the area of contractual intelligence is that it\u2019s about the ecosystem not just about what we launched. So this gives an opportunity for developers to put together applications that are based upon this technology to create solutions so that the market is more fully developed at the time that we\u2019re looking at launching final products. So the timing is not strictly defined at the time that we do these concepts. Gregory Burns : Okay, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Latimore from Northland Capital. Your line is open. Mike Latimore : Yes, good afternoon. Ken I think you said there was unassumed balance sheet loss in the fourth quarter as well that relate to FX, can you say what the size of that is? Pamela Strayer : Yes, it is estimated to be about $1.5 million to $2 million at this point. Mike Latimore : And then it does look like your March quarter guidance for revenue is down a little bit more sequentially, even adjusting for the constant currency and the shorter quarter. I guess is that where the kind of the oil category comes in? Ken Kannappan : Yes, that\u2019s part of it. I mean it\u2019s not the entire extent of it but again I would say that the other thing that happens to us is that we also just simply have timing issues as to when we expect business to occur. Mike Latimore : Right, okay. And then on the contact center side of things, roughly what percent of your hedge is going to contact center side of it? Ken Kannappan : Well, this is how we spend sort of a murky area because we can sell the same products to the same distributors, to the same resellers that can go to the same company, that can be used on different floors of the same building for contact centers and other people. And so it has always been a very, very tricky thing to measure since it is really not a separate market, it is really two different parts of the single market. But I would say that we think it is probably around 25% to 30% of our total enterprise revenues going into that space. Mike Latimore : And just last, I mean, historically you haven\u2019t been focused on acquisition too much, or acquisition is still kind of a low priority? Ken Kannappan : Yeah, I think that acquisitions are always possible and there are two types, there are those that are opportunistic and those that are essential. Something essential is we are looking at our growth strategy where we need to go. We don\u2019t have the tools to get there. We need to get something else and it makes more sense to buy it than it does to partner with a key partner to get there. Ordinarily we tend to partner. It is a technology that's a broader applicability than just our space. They can use it in other spaces. We can use it in this space and work with that company. And that's what we do most of the time where we don\u2019t have the resource internally. But if there were something essential that came along we would absolutely look to strategically buy it if we could. On the opportunistic side, you never know where there is something that may pop up that makes financial and strategic sense and suddenly becomes available. We are not aware of anything that fits all those bills but it is always possible. Mike Latimore : Okay, thank you. Operator : There are no audio questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters. Greg Klaben : Thanks very much everyone for joining us today. If you have any follow up questions we will be available afterwards. Thanks again. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Greg Klaben, you may begin your conference. Greg Klaben : Thanks very much, Joanne. And welcome, everyone, to Plantronics' fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 financial results conference call. Joining me today are Ken Kannappan, Plantronics' President and CEO; and Pam Strayer, Plantronics' Senior Vice President and CFO. The information presented and discussed today includes forward-looking statements, which are made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The risks and uncertainties related to such statements are detailed in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K and today's press release. For the remainder of today's call, we will be providing only non-GAAP metrics related to gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, and EPS. We have reconciled these measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly analyst metric sheet, both of which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website. We have also reconciled constant currency in the Investor Presentation. After the conclusion of today's call, a recording of the call will be available on our website as well. Unless stated otherwise, all comparisons of the fourth quarter financial results are to the same quarter in the prior year. Plantronics' fourth quarter net revenues were $200.8 million. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.61 compared with $0.65 in the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.72 compared with $0.74 in the prior year. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter consists of charges for stock-based compensation and purchase accounting amortization. Both net of the associated tax impact and tax benefits were the release of tax reserves. Please refer to the full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP in our earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken Kannappan : Thank you, Greg. Although the fourth quarter was a slow down, in fiscal 2015 we achieved record revenues, operating income and earnings per share. Revenues grew by 6% to $865 million, operating income grew by 7% to $178 million and earnings per share grew by 7% to $3.04. With that backdrop, I'd like to highlight three major items from fiscal 2015 in our fourth quarter. First, our market position and product differentiation in all product groups remains outstanding and our pace and innovation is unequal. We have focused on our innovation and development, on simplicity, enhancing productivity and improving intelligence for our customers. We've approved these as innovation waves. The first innovation wave we are focused on is what we call taming the communication chaos. As technology proliferates, a number of devices and tools we use for communications grows, the complexity grows exponentially. People have a rapidly growing number of capabilities with the simplicity with which they can used as a challenge. Our customers need to seamlessly and easily connect to a growing variety of devices and applications, and we are working to meet the expectation that everything just works, automatically and intuitively where you want, when you want. By providing better integration, smarter devices and management tools, we are already at the forefront of this opportunity. Many of our enterprise and consumer solutions already include sensors to automatically answer calls, to seamlessly transfer calls based on your movements. This year we will expand on these efforts to broaden the integration capabilities and make them more uniform. Second innovation wave is to enhance productivity and we call it in the zone. We all know what it feels like to be at peak productivity, what is commonly refereed to as the zone. You can feel this at anytime in any activity, where you feel good about what you're doing and know where you\u2019re going, when you\u2019re in conversation, exercising or engaging the project did work. People report feeling as optimal productivity only about 20% of the time when they are at work. We\u2019re working to actively enhance the productivity of workers and say change environments or is the environment around them changes. At work when people are pulled out of the zone there is an economic cost for the company. For example if as our employees focus on a task as interrupted, it takes an average of six minutes to get back to the task, when it is simple and up to a half an hour, they're engaged in innovation. Plantronics is able to help people perform feel and be at their best and whatever they\u2019re doing. We'll give you a specific example. The pioneering technology we created for sound masking will be incorporated into our products allowing people to lessen interruptions as they work in the increasingly common open plan environments. We will also use our acoustics expertise to offer more holistic solutions, modeled on our own smarter working environments to help organizations to solve noise and productivity issues throughout their work spaces. This represents a major growth opportunity that extends our current reach while also supporting our core business. The third innovation wave is driving smarter customer interactions. It is made possible through the unique and proprietary intelligence of our products. The demand for better intelligence is driven by the need to drive customer loyalty and differentiate their services from those that competition. We are using our deep background in contextual intelligence to help businesses drive customer interactions in sophisticated and measurable ways. For example, the context in our needs deliver a great customer experience while being cost effective. We can improve both the cost effectiveness in contact centers as well as the customer experience. Our new portfolio of digital adapters is being integrated with technology from industry leaders like Interactive Intelligence like Avaya for their new contact center platforms. We have unique ability to help contact centers, improve their efficiency and the customer experience they deliver by understanding when agents go on mute, when there is extensive crosstalk, where an agent and a customer might be speaking at the same time and with sales representatives to log in, loud calls and track assets. On delivery of some of these new products has been delayed, in the longer term our highly differentiated and superior product line will place us in an extraordinary position of leadership and delivering value to our customers. The innovation waves incapslated solutions portfolio with the qualities of simplicity, performance, flexibility and contextual intelligence, capabilities our customers tell us they need and value. The second item I would like to emphasize is that we have enhanced our capital allocation policy to return more cash to our shareholders to both stock repurchases and dividends. On March 4, we announced our new policy in addition to an expanded repurchase program increasing a then existing 1 million share authorization of 4 million shares. Through the past fiscal year we've repurchased 2.2 million shares. We have a consistent history of returning cash to shareholders, and returned over 90% of our growing free cash flow over the past ten years. I\u2019ll recap quickly the updated capital allocation policy. Our Board of Directors approved a new return of capital policy that will return more cash to shareholders, balance cash return between regular dividends and consistent stock buybacks and utilize a prudent amount of leverage to enhance shareholder returns. Our new policy targets return on 60% of total free cash flow defined as total operating cash flow, less capital expenditures. We also routine our cash distributions targets of two-thirds in the form of stock repurchases and one-third in the form of quarterly cash dividends. However the actual percentage returned in a given quarter may be significantly more or less than the long term goal. Plantronics Board of Directors intense to regularly reevaluate return of capital policy and updated when appropriate based on business performance in domestic and foreign tax policies. In particular there is a material change in a geographic distribution of Plantronics' cash flows or a change in relative tax rates between jurisdictions, Plantronics' may increase or decrease its return of capital targets. Third, we expect our total addressable market to grow by double-digit compounded annual rate over the next five years and we expect to keep pace with that level of growth. Unified Communications continues to represent our largest revenue and profit opportunity and our leadership in the categories as strong as ever. UC revenues grew by 18% during fiscal 2015 and represented 23% of total company revenues for the year. The long-term UC outlook remains significant and we continue to believe we\u2019re in the very early days of this opportunity. With that, I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Pam. Pamela Strayer : Thanks Ken. First an overview of our results. As a reminder unless stated otherwise, all comparisons of our Q4 fiscal year 2015 financial results are to Q4 of fiscal year 2014. Given the significant movement and foreign currency exchange rates, I\u2019ll be covering some constant currency comparisons. Constant currency results show what Q4 fiscal year 2015 results would be, had last year's Q4 exchange rates still been in effect. Hedging gains taken in Q4 2015 are excluded in order to reflect the FX mutual trends. It should be noted that these constant currency results can only address a quantifiable impact on how foreign currency denominated business gets reported in our U.S. dollar financial reports. What these metrics don't capture is the impact we have from additional pricing pressure discounting our loss business in locations where U.S. dollar denominated pricing negatively impacts buying decisions. Fourth quarter net revenues were $200.8 million representing a 4% decrease. On a constant currency basis our fourth quarter revenues were $205.1million, a decrease of 2% from Q4 of the prior year. Breaking down the currency impact on our revenues, FX movement decreased our revenues by $7.9 million. However, our hedging program protected us against $3.6 million of this loss for a net negative impact of $4.3 million. Non-GAAP operating income of $40.4 million is a decrease of $1.3 million or 3.1%. Currency movements reduced our operating expenses year-over-year by $5.1 million. On a constant currency basis, our non-GAAP operating income is lower than what we report in U.S. dollars. Although this is not intuitive to FX benefit that we recorded in operating expenses exceeded the net negative impact recorded to revenue due to our hedging gains. Therefore, we have a small increase in operating income from our hedging program. Constant currency, operating income therefore is $39.5 million, which represents a decrease of 5.3%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.72 per share is $0.02 lower than the prior year, a decrease of approximately 3%. On a constant currency basis, our EPS would have been $0.75 per share, an increase of approximately 1%. I want to highlight a few key points in our financial results for the quarter. First we experienced a slow down in our enterprise business this quarter for several reasons. Our delayed introduction of two of our new EncorePro headset had a negative but unquantifiable impact on our enterprise revenues during the quarter. We had a decline in Russia, where we hold a large share of the enterprise market. We also believe that layoffs and massive reductions in capital spending in the energy sector, just one of larger vertical markets had a negative impact on our results. Finally we believe an upcoming launch of Microsoft's new UC Platform Skype for business may have postponed UC deployments in headset purchases temporarily. Second, our operating margins remain in our target range with solid operating income and EPS despite the increasingly negative impact from the strengthening dollar during the quarter. Our EPS came in within our guidance range despite revenues being lower than guidance due to favorable FX impacts on operating expenses a lower tax rate and favorable gross margins due to product mix. Third, we will remain focused on the long-term growth of the company over near-term profitability targets, although we believe we will end the year with an operating margin above 19%. Currency movements may constrain our ability to do this without making spending cuts that would impact our competitiveness. Now I\u2019ll cover revenue in more detail. Total net revenues for the fourth quarter of $200.8 million were down $8.3 million or 4%, compared to the fourth quarter last year substantially all of which was driven by a 6% decline in our Americas revenues, which was driven by a decline in consumer. Revenues in our Europe and Africa region were flat versus a year ago that grew by 6% on a constant currency basis and revenues were down 3% in our Asia Pac region that grew 2% on a constant currency basis. The following are key product line comparisons to Q4 last year. Enterprise net revenues of $148.7 million were down roughly $1.8 million and 1% on a constant currency basis, enterprise revenues grew by 1% over the prior year. Core enterprise decreased by $4 million and 4% on a constant currency basis. Core OCC revenues decreased by $2 million and 2%. UC revenues were $45.8 million, up 5% compared to the prior year quarter. On a constant currency basis, UC revenues grew by 8%. Consumer net revenues were down 11% and down 9% on a constant currency basis. This decrease was driven largely by a decline in the U.S. Mono Bluetooth market of over 20%. However, we continue to achieve share gains in this market. The decline in Mono Bluetooth was greater than expected and being driven in part by smaller shelf space allocated to the category in favor of the faster growing stereo Bluetooth category. In addition, Radio Shack's restructuring eliminated an important retail channel outlet faster than we had anticipated. While we are pleased with our growth in Stereo Bluetooth category, the growth could not sufficiently offset the lower revenues in Mono Bluetooth. We have a strong pipeline of new mono and stereo products and are confident in maintaining a strong position in Mono Bluetooth, believe we have the opportunity to gain share in Stereo Bluetooth. Non-GAAP gross margin was better than expected at 54.7% up 120 basis points compared with last year's 53.5%. The primary driver of the improved gross margin is product mix offset by some negative currency impacts. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $69.5 million down $0.5 million compared to Q4 of last year due primarily to lower variable compensation on lower revenue and the positive impact of the currency movements. These decreases were offset by higher headcount and related costs. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 34.6%, up 110 basis points from the prior year of 33.5% due to decline in revenue. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 20.1%, up from 20% in the prior year and within our long-term operating model range of 20% to 23% even though our revenue fell below expectations. When you exclude GN litigation expenses of $1.4 million, and exclude the unusual litigation gains we recorded this quarter, the operating margin would have been 20.4%. Below the operating income line we had foreign currency losses recorded in other income and expense that did not occur in the prior year. We recorded a loss of $2.4 million net of gains recorded from our hedging program. The majority of this loss was a loss on the Brazilian Real which is unhedged but had significant movements during the quarter. Our non-GAAP profit before tax decreased 10.4% over the prior year. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.9%, a tax rate has declined to 25.5% for the full year on a non-GAAP basis. The decrease was due primarily to higher foreign earnings. As a result of all these items, our Q4 non-GAAP net income of $30.6 million was 4% lower than a year ago, yielding non-GAAP EPS of $0.72 down $0.02 from last year\u2019s Q4 result. A few notes on our hedging program. I described our hedging program on the call last quarter, however I would like to provide a few updates and clarifications. For the balance sheet hedges, we changed our approach and are hedging these exposures fully at 100% for currencies we hedged. We hedged balances in Euro, British Pound, and Australian Dollars. Our losses recorded in Q4 was entirely to non-hedged currencies. Now on to the P&L. As we discussed last quarter we enter into Costcos colors each month which settle 12 months in the future. We hedge between 50% to 70% of the revenue exposure and all gains and losses are recorded into revenue. We believe our overall hedging program combined with the natural offset from expenses in local currencies effectively protects our net income from a significant amount of volatility when that changes in our major currencies. In addition, they effectively provide a floor for downside risk or continued decline in foreign currencies. Now on the balance sheet and cash flow highlights. We finished the quarter with $482 million in cash and investments on our balance sheet and generated over $54 million in cash flow from operations during the period. Of the $482 million in cash and investments at quarter end, $16 million was domestic. We used $85.5 million to repurchase shares during the quarter and drew down on our line of credit by $34.5 million. DSO was 61 days up from 60 days at the end of Q4 the prior year. Net inventories were flat versus the year ago, inventory terms are 6.5 compared to 6.9 in Q4 of last year primarily due to lower revenues than expected offset by improvements in our inventory management practices, specifically the introduction of lean manufacturing for a couple of key product lines. Turning to our capital expenditures. Our Q4 investment was $2.7 million or 1.3% of net revenues. Large expenditures included cost related to the construction of a new smarter working office at our European headquarters site in the Netherlands and investment in manufacturing execution system for our Mexican plant and equipment and tooling for our operations. Total CapEx for fiscal year 2016 is expected to be approximately $30 million up from $22 million we spent in fiscal year 2015. Roughly $9 million of the FY16 forecast is related to our new headquarters facility in the Netherlands. Depreciation expense on a GAAP basis for Q4 was $4.7 million, up about $1 million from the prior year. Turning to outlook. We believe total net revenues for the first fiscal quarter ending in June will be in the range of $202 million to $212 million. This forecast assumes gross margins to be in the range of 52% to 53%, lower than the current quarter margins due to products mix impact of higher consumer revenues compared to Q4. On a constant currency basis with Q1 of fiscal year 2015, this range would be roughly $210 million to 220 million and at the mid point would represent a decrease of 1% in the prior year. At today's spot rates on the Euro and British pounds, we would expect the negative currency impact to revenue of roughly $12 million offset by hedging gains of approximately $4 million for a negative net impact of $8 million. Depending on revenue mix and other factors, we believe our operating - our GAAP operating income will be approximately $26 million to $31million and non-GAAP operating income of approximately $34 million to $39 million. The GAAP reconciling items we expect in the first quarter include approximately $8 million and stock-based compensation expense and purchase accounting amortization before tax. Although this results in a non-GAAP operating margin which is below 19%, we expect to improve profitability through revenue growth in the second half of the year and to end above 19%. Our guidance expects we will spent approximately $1 million on GN litigation in Q1. The GN lawsuit is still on discovery phase and the impact to operating income from an associated legal expenses is particularly difficult to forecast. Actual expenses can vary significantly from our forecast. On a constant currency basis with Q1 of FY15, we expect the positive impact to our expenses of roughly $6 million. Therefore currency rate do not change significantly, the positive OpEx impacts combined with the negative impact on the revenue line of $8 million means our hedging program will protect us from all but about $2 million in negative impacts to operating income. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter is expected to be 26% and we're anticipating a full year tax rate of 26%. Based on all of the above and the first quarter, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.48 to $0.57 per share and non-GAAP EPS to be $0.62 to $0.71 per share on average diluted shares outstanding of approximately $40 million. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Greg, who will cover the long term market model and update for the year. Greg Klaben : Thanks Pam. At the beginning of every fiscal year we update our total adjustable market and growth expectations for the subsequent five years. Working with industry analyst firms Frost & Sullivan analytics, in addition to our own estimate, we've updated the average growth rate expected for our markets from calendar year 2014 to calendar year 2019. I\u2019ll walk you through the total addressable market now and if you haven\u2019t already seen the new IR Presentation with these slides, they are available on the IR section of our website. Overall as Ken mentioned, we\u2019re expecting our total addressable market and our own growth to be in the double-digit rate over the next five years. We would expect the enterprise market to comprise of core enterprise, contact center and Unified Communications, which grow by an 11% CAGR through calendar 2019 and as we've discussed over the past year, we will be reporting enterprise revenues in aggregate going forward. We're anticipating a CAGR of approximately 8% in our consumer addressable market comprised of Mono and Stereo Bluetooth, gaming and clarity products. In Slide 27 in our IR presentation, we've sized the enterprise market at $1.2 billion in calendar year 2014 growing to $2 billion in calendar year 2019 and the consumer market growing from $1.5 billion in calendar year 2014 to $2.3 billion in calendar year 2019. Our five year CAGR for the consumer market is in line with last year's projection; however for the enterprise market, it\u2019s significantly lower than the 17% to 18% CAGR we forecast last year. The current forecast incorporates recent growth rates in Unified Communications and a slight impact from the currency headwinds. Our longer term outlook for mass market adoption of Unified Communications is in no way diminished and we\u2019re fully confident that the fundamentals of UC adoption and headsets to the device of choice are on track. Attach rates of headsets continue to be 60% or higher when Unified Communications Solutions with voice are deployed and desktop phones are taken away. Current attach rates for global knowledge workers using headsets are approximately 7% and are expected to grow to 15% in calendar year 2019. Our gross margins in UC remain in line with our long-term corporate model and we do not believe we have experienced any market share losses new entrants. However, selling prices in the market remain solid and we believe our product portfolio and overall solution set is significantly differentiated from the competition. I\u2019d also like to note that we\u2019re anticipating a modest growth rate for revenues for fiscal year 2016 as compared with the five year growth rate in our market model. With that I\u2019d like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dave King with Roth Capital Partners. Your line is open. Dave King : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Ken Kannappan : Good morning. Dave King : I guess first off I was -- I just wanted to dig into the revenue trends in the quarter a little bit more. First on UC it looks like that was up 8% or so in constant currency and then in some of the prepared remarks you guys touched on new link deployment as one of the issues and then I think some of the other stuff in terms of energy etcetera. But in terms of the new link deployment, our new link from Microsoft what\u2019s the timing of that? How much do you think that weighed on the quarter, obviously it\u2019s tough to be able to quantify but how should we be thinking about that both in terms of what impact it had during the quarter and then how to think about that in terms of subsequent quarters? And then also in terms of markets where currency didn\u2019t necessarily have an impact, but there weaker demand, I understand that it would probably tough to quantify as well but could you maybe touch on what\u2019s the exposure there? How much of UC revenue is tied to Russia and some of these other countries. Thanks. Ken Kannappan : All right. We\u2019ll try. This is Ken, let me kind of start a little bit. So first of all it is difficult for us to actually know how much is due to the timing of scope for business, which is at this point in time is kind of formally launched next week I think at the Ignite Conference that Microsoft has. I think that it is normal for a lot of businesses to want to build with the latest technology if they\u2019re going to implement it. So as you just start to get just before the major new product announcement seeing a little bit of slow down, it\u2019s not a typical after you get the new product to test out a little bit decide you want to go with that is normally when you would expect a little bit of resumption. We\u2019ve certainly seen that in the past. Well that is the case now, we don\u2019t have the 20 hind side mirror out or not, but we have heard that. I would say that having said, the bigger issue in my mind link is then that many customers have taken link and have not yet used the voice clients. They're using the IM and the presence and they're not using the voice and so that represents a bigger opportunity fundamentally for people to move forward with these soft clients let\u2019s see. Relative to some of your other questions, I do not think that -- so we had a fall off in Russia and we certainly do have a disproportionately high share of that business on the business side and it was -- having said that, it was not primarily UC centric. There is UC business in Russia absolutely, but it is not one of our higher adoption areas from UC. We actually had a bigger effect in the U.S. where the market overall has not been as heavily affected. I\u2019m not sure I got all of your questions, because there were so many parts to it. Dave King : Right, no I think that mainly covers it. I guess just to also follow on that, you maybe out for the UC just better understanding some of the revenue drivers I guess the other thing I was curious about in terms of EncorePro has that -- is that now -- are those now shipping and when do you expect to be I guess when do you expect to recouping that revenue or that loss revenue in the period? And then are you able to quantify the impact of the consumer business from Radio Shack? Ken Kannappan : All right, let me try to do this. So first of all, on EncorePro we do not expect to be able to ship until a considerable delay, by which I mean October. We certainly have lost revenue as a result of not having that product and we\u2019ll lose revenue throughout the June and September quarters as a result of not having that product that\u2019s incorporated into the -- obviously the results that we already have and the guidance that we had for the June quarter. It is very disappointing to us. In essence we really had to do almost a full redesign of one element of the product just to get it up to our standard level on that. Let me see in terms of Radio Shack, we've had customers go through bankruptcy and very often they are able to operate in bankruptcy in a diminished fashion that didn\u2019t prove to be the case, we actually had kind of zero revenues from Radio Shack again unfortunately that was an account where we just had an extremely high share of their business. So it is an effect and perhaps a little bit of disproportionate effect for us. Are we disclosing the size or not? Okay, I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re giving a specific size of these accounts but it certainly was a major retail consumer account for us. Dave King : Okay. That\u2019s all very helpful Ken and then lastly maybe switching gears to Pam, in terms of gross margin it looks like that was up and you may have touched on it in your prepared remarks but I\u2019ve missed it, it looks like that was up even more or so than I think what would be implied by mix, is there anything else specific you can kind of move call out there that maybe driving that? Pamela Strayer : Well mix was certainly the most significant impact, E&O expense exceeds excess and obsolete inventory charges for the quarter were so low, so that helped us as well. But really when you look at how low our consumer mix was for the quarter, it\u2019s very lower than we\u2019ve seen in probably eight quarters. So that was primary driver. Dave King : Okay, thanks. And good luck for rest of the year. Ken Kannappan : Thank you. Pamela Strayer : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Paul Coster : Thanks. Just quick questions, first with '16 outlook, initially it sounds like the growth rate is going to be slightly less than that implied by the overall markets with the sort of five year context that Greg was talking about, just I think it\u2019s obvious, but perhaps you can just explain why it\u2019s still little bit lower this year? Ken Kannappan : Well I think that we\u2019ve seen slower adoption than we had earlier expected in the market. I think that all of the industry forecasters have kind of taken down their expectations just based on one I think macroeconomic people were expecting to have slightly better economic conditions than we have. Two, more particularly as it relates to UC again the actual adoption in use of some of the voice clients is just a little bit behind where people expect it and we\u2019ve kind of extrapolated out the more recent results into our expectations. Paul Coster : Regarding the Microsoft link or the Scott business introduction will it be feature set on the Plantronics product line that will be exploiting that new platform and are new to the world? Ken Kannappan : Well there are new features in Skype for business, there are features that are particular to Plantronics integration with Skype, there is nothing that is specifically new to Skype for business from Plantronics with some more carry-over of our existing portfolio on to that new platform. Paul Coster : Okay. And then finally what was the underlying cause of the product delays for the EncorePro product? Ken Kannappan : Sure in essence without going into too much detail, we had a situation where a portion of products would not wind up having the kind of useful life that we normally expect. In essence we were using a brand new laser welding system, which turns out with some small fiber glass content in some of the pieces resulted in a little bit of work in essence. So we actually had to fundamentally change the design, it\u2019s something we\u2019ve done in the past, we were using some more advanced processes which should have some benefits but in this case it did create a lack of reliability and a portion of the products that people would have experienced over time and people buy a Plantronics product, they expect to get two or three Ex the useful years of our competition we have to deliver that. Paul Coster : All right, thanks Ken. Operator : Your next question comes from Greg Burns with Sidoti & Company. Your line is open. Gregory Burns : Hi, in terms of your Bluetooth market what percent comes from mono versus stereo and then what is your market share differential between mono and stereo? Ken Kannappan : So for Plantronics, still a much larger portion of our business is coming from mono. Clearly the stereo business is rising pretty significantly. Let me talk for a second on market share, in mono we're the global leader in market share. We\u2019ve consistently seen increases in that already strong position. In the U.S. through the March quarter and I frankly I didn\u2019t think it could rise from where it was, we went up from 51% in last year to 56% in the March quarter. In Stereo, we're clearly a small player. We really are not targeting the broad stereo market right, now but we\u2019re really doing is following our business customer into stereo markets and throughout that business customers day. So for example we're doing products for the business person when they are playing games, when they are listening music, when they are running, that type of thing. Our overall mix is about 70% mono, above 30% stereo right now. Gregory Burns : Okay. Thank you. And in terms of the GN lawsuit, are you accruing anything in terms of that and what is your outlook for the completion of that litigation? Ken Kannappan : So I\u2019ll let Pam talk to the accruals, but our look for the completion of litigation is that its still going to be sometime we believe. We believe that the case is going very well in terms of substance but that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re not able to continue it for, quite sometime but which I mean at least for year maybe two. Pamela Strayer : Regarding the accrual, no we don\u2019t haven't accrued anything for the GN litigation. We would only do that if we thought it was probable and we could estimate the loss, which we can't at this point in time. Gregory Burns : Okay. Lastly what was the main driver for the lower tax rate this quarter and what to project the diluted share count to be for next quarter? Pamela Strayer : So the lower tax rate this quarter was driven by higher foreign earning and the share estimated at 40 million shares for Q1. Gregory Burns : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Your line is open. Tavis McCourt : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Pam first a clarification, I think you said in the prepared comments that, the net revenue impact this quarter from currency was little over $4 million. What was the reference period there year-over-year or relative to December? Pamela Strayer : Yeah, that was a year-over-year reference. Tavis McCourt : Okay. And then Ken, can you talk about kind of the ultimate leverage goals for the business? I think in your press release in early March you commented a little bit about the amount of debt you\u2019ll be willing to put on the business kind of, if you don\u2019t have an exact number at least philosophically, what you\u2019re thinking about? Ken Kannappan : Well sure, but I do want to say that we\u2019ve made the comment there about the Board regularly reevaluate the structure and I want to talk for a second about our journey to this structure. When we look back five, six years back, we had a Bluetooth business where we have nowhere near the market share we do now. It was intensely competitive. Many people weren\u2019t focused on making it profit. It's now matured and gotten more stable. We were entering the UC business. We didn\u2019t know for sure, what the margins would turn out to be. We did not know for sure, what kind of industry position we would get. What kind of leadership. What kind of market share. Those have all turned out very, very favorably. We've been able to improve our working capital efficiency pretty dramatically. So all of these have given us greater confidence in the cash flow of the business and our positions, which has helped us decide that at least for right now of suitable capital structures puts us at least at the, what we would call kind of near investment grade level of debt or in another words debt does not come with constraining financial covenants on the business. We\u2019re still a technology company. We still want to have considerable financial flexibility in case of the unexpected. So, is that helpful? Tavis McCourt : Well yes, I guess is there any indication you give on what that would mean in terms of a growth that EBITDA number or some other ratio that would be kind of helpful longer term? Ken Kannappan : Well that\u2019s the problem when you said the longer term thing, because sometimes the credit markets themselves vary a little bit over time and we want to be a little bit cautious in making sure that we\u2019re good for a period of time and at the same time our industry dynamic contains a little bit. I would suffice to say that for if you look at whether we want to call us kind of a relatively small technology company just short of a billion with the kind of a good market position that there are ratios that represent that kind of near investment grade level kind of strong BB, BB Plus type of rating if you think but public data course it can also be line of credit type of stuff that we would look at. But that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re centered and then look at more than just EBITDA coverage in terms of the financial structure. So I\u2019m not being very specific, but I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s still helpful to you. Tavis McCourt : Yeah I didn\u2019t expect exact numbers. That was helpful Ken, thanks. And then two other follow-up questions, I guess given the weakness in consumer in March quarter and some of the headwinds in enterprise, can you kind of help us on how we should think about the mix of business in June between enterprise and consumer? And then also you\u2019re starting out the year Ken, it looks like well below kind of the low end of the operating margin goal obviously a lot of reasons for that. How do you expect the full year to trend on a margin basis assuming no dramatic change in currencies and economic trends from here? Ken Kannappan : So, let me try to answer both a little bit and Pam might help me out. But first in all honestly if we look back at the December quarter, it would have been a dime higher absent FX right. Clearly the March quarter would have been substantially higher clearly if we look forward at this fiscal year, we would have been in our minds having a pretty explosive earning story on this set of constant currency revenues. We have cut down our expenditures some as a result of this. But only to some degree, because ironically where this hurts us, this actually helps our competitors in terms of the FX rate. So we\u2019re not able to cut back too much and so it is going to bring down the operating margin a little bit over where we would have been with a better FX environment. In terms of the June quarter I believe that the mix is going to be a little bit stronger again on the business side over on the consumer side. Pam, you want to add in that? Pam Strayer : Well on gross margins, we\u2019re not providing guidance on that number I guess what I would say is when you look back historically over the last five to seven years we\u2019ve ranged typically between 52% and 53% and I\u2019m not seeing anything that would dramatically drive us off of that. Tavis McCourt : I was referring to operating margins, I apologize. Pam Strayer : Sorry on operating margin yes, so as I talked about earlier we expect it to be above 19%. We certainly will try and get to 20%, but with the currency headwinds that\u2019s going to be a challenge. Tavis McCourt : I got you. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Mike Latimore with Northland Capital Management. Your line is open. Mike Latimore : Okay, thanks a lot yeah, on the Unified Communications business I guess are you seeing projects that were supposed to be implemented just the implementation timelines just get stretched out or are there deals that were -- you\u2019re expecting to sort of come in, in the fall that have been delayed. Can you just give a little more color on kind of the UC patterns are? Ken Kannappan : So, we\u2019ve seen both of those, but that\u2019s not entirely new in that it\u2019s been kind of a continuing phenomena of the market where there have been a number of companies that indicate they\u2019re going to do things and the actual rollouts have been delayed. Perhaps there\u2019s a little bit more so but nonetheless again it's not a new phenomena on either element. I think we\u2019ve seen a little less customers come in and again that\u2019s where we primarily think there\u2019s a possibility, that it\u2019s a delay for the new platform and then again the other big thing really is that we just have this big backlog of customers that have deployed and haven\u2019t activated the voice license yet. Mike Latimore : All right. And when they haven't deployed the voice, what are they telling you the main rationale? Ken Kannappan : Well in some cases, they\u2019re getting all these licenses as a bundle and so they just elected to go ahead and get people familiar with the presence tool, with the IM tool, they think they\u2019re happy enough with their existing telephone lines for whatever reasons. So they\u2019re just using two different systems rather than unified systems. Mike Latimore : Got it. Okay. And then I believe there was a delay in one of the consumer product but when do you expect that to start shipping? Ken Kannappan : I\u2019m not familiar with the delay in consumer. Mike Latimore : Okay. All right. Ken Kannappan : There was a delay in our business product the EncorePro, that's what you're thinking about? Mike Latimore : Yes I was thinking about BackBeat FIT I believe. Ken Kannappan : Yes so that one we\u2019re not unfortunately be shipping the EncorePro until what\u2026 Greg Klaben : But I think Michael you\u2019re referring to the allocation when we come off allocation? Ken Kannappan : That's different. That's not a delay. That's just a structural component shortage that we had for the BackBeat FIT and it's been a very long delay. We do expect that by August that will be alleviated significantly. Mike Latimore : Got it. Okay thanks. And then just last what's your general thought on the year in terms of revenue? Do you think you can grow revenues this year in light of FX or how you think about kind of overall revenue growth this year? Ken Kannappan : So the way we see it is that in all honesty this year would have been a pretty decent year in constant currency. So we are going to in our minds grow, I want to kind of remind whatever disclosure risk we have on savings sorts of things. But we still expect to be able to grow kind of normally in constant currency. How it gets reported is going to be clearly impacted by FX but we think it will still end up being a positive number. Mike Latimore : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenter. Greg Klaben : Let me thank you all very much for joining our call. I recognize it's early and now it\u2019s spilled over into the open market. If you have any further questions, we would be available. Thank you again. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Leonie, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Klaben. You may begin your conference. Greg Klaben : Thanks, Leonie. So welcome everyone to Plantronics' first quarter fiscal year 2016 financial results conference call. Joining me today are Ken Kannappan, Plantronics' President and CEO; and Pam Strayer, Plantronics' Senior Vice President and CFO. The information presented and discussed today includes forward-looking statements, which are made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The risks and uncertainties related to such statements are detailed in our most recent 10-Q, 10-K and today's press release. For the remainder of today's call, we will be providing only non-GAAP metrics related to gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, and EPS. We have reconciled these measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly analyst metric sheet, both of which are available on the Investor Relations page of our Web site. We have also reconciled constant currency in the Investor Presentation. And additionally after the conclusion of today's call, the recording of the call will be available with information on our Web site. Unless stated otherwise, all comparisons of the first quarter fiscal year 2016 are to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. Plantronics' first quarter net revenues were $206.4 million. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.55 compared with $0.68 in fiscal 2015. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.67 compared with $0.78 in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter consists of charges for stock-based compensation, purchase accounting amortization, both are net of the associated tax impact, and tax benefits from the release of tax reserves. Please refer to the full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP in our earnings release. Plantronics has two upcoming investor events we hope you would be able to join. The first is an Analyst Day with members of our senior management team at the New York Stock Exchange on the morning of September 2. We are also planning a field trip to our manufacturing plant in Tijuana, Mexico in the second half of September. Please let me know if you\u2019re interested in attending, and I will provide additional information. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken Kannappan : Thank you, Greg. Our first quarter revenue and earnings were in line with our guidance, but they were also down year-over-year primarily due to a strong dollar in the resulting unfavorable currency effect. On a constant currency basis, our overall revenue declined by 1% year-over-year with 3% growth in enterprise and a 12% decline in consumer. If we factor in our foreign sales made in U.S dollars where we had to adjust price to be competitive with local currencies, we believe we would have had flat to up revenue. Besides currency translation, additional factors impeding our top line growth included : on the consumer side, the Mono Bluetooth category in the consumer market declined significantly, more rapidly than it had in the last several years. This was partially offset by continued market share growth, in particular in the U.S. market, we grew from 51% last year to 58% so far this year according to NPD Intellect. However, it was also negatively impacted by inventory declines on the part of our channel partners. Secondly, the delay of two new EncorePro headsets for the intensive user category in the enterprise market, these products are scheduled to begin shipping later this fall, and while the precise financial impact of the delay is unquantifiable, some customers certainly impacted their plans and did not make purchases until the products are available. UC revenue grew year-over-year, but was below historical growth rates. We believe this is partially due to Microsoft commencing its rollout of its rebranded UC platform previously called Linked and renamed Skype for business in late May. We believe that some IT departments delayed rollouts of UC as they consider the new version, thus delaying headset purchases. We continue to see a negative year-over-year impact from the bankruptcy of Radio Shack, the decline of the Russian ruble, and weaker economic conditions in the energy sector. The three points I\u2019d like to highlight for our first quarter and the Company in general are : number one, fiscal 2016 is being impacted by a number of factors with the most significant being currency. We also expect our fiscal year constant currency growth rates to be below our long-term forecast of 10%. However, we continue to believe our long-term top line growth opportunity is 10% with the key drivers being unified communications and stereo Bluetooth. Second, we\u2019ve executed on our capital allocation strategy with repurchase of over 5 million shares during the quarter backed by the issuance of $500 million in eight year notes. As of today, we have approximately 1.8 million shares remaining in our repurchase authorization. Third, we\u2019ve recently announced some very promising new products with industry first functionality that squarely target our innovation waves. As you may recall from our last call, our innovation waves are focus areas where Plantronics is uniquely able to solve customer requirements. We received increasingly positive feedback from enterprise and consumer customers that were meeting their strategic direction with these innovation waves, which are about creating simple and easy use products, enhancing customer experiences, and improving intelligence for the customer service center. The first Innovation Wave aims at delivering simple and easy to use products and is referred as taming the communications chaos. Our goal is to provide better integration in smarter headsets and tools for users in IT departments. We introduced Plantronics Hub software which is a client application that allows end users to control the settings on their Plantronics audio devices. End users can customize their ring tone, ring location, configure presence updates, and with the new app users can monitor and manage their headsets from their Android or iOS phones or Apple watches. The app supports all of our new products and includes features such as find my headset, headset battery monitoring, alerts when mute is enabled, and connection status. At the enterprise level, Plantronics Hub is part of this Plantronics Spokes software portfolio. And together with Plantronics Manager and Manager Pro, it allows enterprise IT managers to seamlessly administer and support the Plantronics audio devices in their organization. As new software is deployed or upgraded in these organizations, a challenge is to ensure the compatibility for voice and audio is maintained. By communicating with Plantronics Manager Pro in the cloud for updates, settings, firmware, and reporting, IT departments can effectively tame the chaos and manage their global headset deployments more efficiently. We also introduced two new versions of our enterprise Blackwire products, targeting the mobile worker who needs to connect to multiple devices. The entry level Blackwire 350 and 325 corded headsets helped tame the chaos as they feature both USB and 3.5 millimeter connectivity options for individuals using a PC, smartphone, tablet, or all three. The increased flexibility of these headsets provide make it easier for IT departments to match the right headset with an individual\u2019s personal work style and work environment, make it extremely easy for the user to switch the headset from one device to another. The second Innovation Wave focused on enhancing productivity is referred to as In the Zone. The productivity of knowledge workers is crucial for organizations. Open plan environments designed to improve collaboration can create interruptions from knowledge workers who are concentrating. We\u2019ve just introduced the Voyager Focus headset for UC and multimedia applications. And it\u2019s uniquely designed to help workers stay in the zone in an open plan environment while having multi point connectivity to mobile phones, laptops, tablets, and desk phones. With active noise cancellation, long run, long range Bluetooth connectivity of 150 feet, 12 hour talk time, enhanced USB with three microphones for superior noise cancellation; the Voyager Focus was built expressly for the needs of employees in open space work environments. Getting an enthusiastic response from customers who want to eliminate background noise on calls, and add to the time employees are in the zone. The Voyager Focus is also equipped with our trademark sensors providing an intuitive experience for the user by muting the call when the headset is removed and answering a call or resuming music when the headset is put back on. The Voyager Focus also reduces background sound even when you\u2019re not on a call, allowing you to be avoid interruptions from people near you. The Voyager Focus UC provides a 12 hour talk time and up to 15 hours of dynamic Hi-Fi stereo music streaming. Integrated open-mic feature, allows you to hear your surroundings when you need to and enhanced voice alerts provide caller ID, mute status, connection status, and talk time level. Our gaming line of products received a much needed refresh with the introduction of RIG 500 series for an immersive gaming experience, which allows gamers to be in the zone. We demoed these products at the E3 Conference to an enthusiastic reception. These ultra-light noise canceling and durable PC gaming headsets have been engineered specifically for the intensity of E sports with interchangeable components, personalized style, precise fit, and incredible comfort. The RIG 500 series system includes components such as vented air and sound isolating ear cups, several colors of headbands, mobile stereo cables, a digital USB adapter with Dolby 7.1 surround sound and 24 bit audio support. This series of gaming headsets will be available worldwide within the next month or so. The third Innovation Wave is focused on driving smarter customer interactions and is made possible through the unique and proprietary intelligence our products provide. Here we\u2019re very focused on integrating our technology with that of our strategic alliance partners to build solutions to go beyond providing the exceptional call quality enterprise have come to expect from Plantronics. Our new digital adapter the DA80 and its superior audio optimization technology delivers richer, clear communications for an improved call experience for both customer service reps and their customers. When integrated with Plantronics Manager Pro software and Plantronics Hub, contact centers can configure, update, and track their DA80s by their unique serial number, simply workflows, receive information to improve operations. Plantronics also offers developers free open APIs integrated vents from the DA80 with third-party software applications. Our adapters have already been integrated with customer service products from alliance partners such as Genesis, [indiscernible], and Interactive Intelligence, will help lead to real business results for our enterprise customers. We believe this portfolio of highly differentiated solutions for smarter customer interactions presents an extraordinary position of leadership. Turning to our capital allocation policy, we made solid progress from returning cash to our stockholders and utilizing debt to fund repurchases. The past year we\u2019ve announced repurchase authorizations for 10 million shares and have 1.8 million shares remaining for purchase under authorizations as of today. Our capital allocation policy targets a return of 60% of total free cash flow, defined as total operating cash flow less capital expenditures. We are also targeting our cash distribution of two-thirds in the form of stock repurchases, and one-third in the form of dividends. However, the actual percentage returned in a given quarter year maybe significantly more or less than our long-term goal. We remain as confident as ever in our market opportunities and our competitive position. With that, I will turn the call over to Pam. Pamela Strayer : Thanks, Ken. First an overview of our results. As a reminder, unless stated otherwise, all comparisons of our Q fiscal year 2016 financial results are to Q1 of fiscal year 2015. Given the significant impact of foreign currency exchange rates and our year-over-year comparisons, we\u2019re providing constant currency results for many of our key metrics. First quarter net revenues were $206.4 million representing a 4.8% decrease. On a constant currency basis, our first quarter revenues were $214.3 million, a decrease of 1% from Q1 of the prior year. Breaking down the currency impact on our revenues, FX movements decreased our revenues by $11.4 million. However, our hedging program protected us against $3.5 million of this loss for a net negative impact of $7.9 million. It should be noted that these constant currency results can only address a quantifiable impact on how foreign currency denominated business gets reported in our U.S dollar financial reports. What these metrics don\u2019t capture is the impacts we had from additional pricing pressure, discounting, or lost business in locations where we sell in U.S dollar outside the U.S and the stronger dollar negatively impacts buying decisions. Approximately 9% of our total revenues fall into that category and we believe our revenues would have been flat to up without the negative impact of currencies.  Our non-GAAP gross margin was 52.4%, down 80 basis points compared with last year\u2019s 53.2%. The primary driver of the decline in gross margin is negative currency impacts on revenues that are partially offset by favorable product mix. Approximately over 75% of our cost of goods sold is denominated in U.S dollars, so we do not see a significant currency benefit in those costs. Our non-GAAP operating income of $37.5 million is a decrease of $6.6 million or 15.1%. On a constant currency basis, our operating income was $39.5 million, which represents a decrease of 10.5% over the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.67 per share is $0.11 lower than the prior year. On a constant currency basis, our EPS would have been $0.72, a decrease of approximately 8%. EPS was negatively impacted in the quarter by interest expense associated with our $500 million debt offering, net of a tax benefit and net of share repurchases made to date. We repurchased 5.1 million shares during the quarter and currently have approximately 1.8 million shares remaining in our repurchase authorization. I want to highlight a few key points in our financial results for the quarter. First, while the stronger dollar is clearly impacting our revenue growth and lowering our profitability, our enterprise business remains strong and grew by 3% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by UC deployments, but also by growth in our core Office and Contact Center products. Second, we will continue to return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases, having a positive impact to EPS over the long-term. Third, we will remain focused on the long-term growth of the Company over near-term profitability targets. Currency movements are impacting our ability to report operating margins of 20% or above and do not have a similar impact on our primary competitors. While we have explored the possibility of cutting cost to improve profitability, we believe it will put us at a significant competitive disadvantage to cut cost further at this time. Due to the significant impact that currency have on our profitability reported in dollars and the inability to forecast or control this important factor, we will not be providing profitability guidance beyond Q2 at this time. Now I\u2019ll cover revenue in more detail. Total net revenues for the first quarter were $206.4 million and down $10.3 million or 5%, compared to the first quarter last year substantially all of which was driven by a 6% decline in our Americas revenue. Revenues in our Europe and Africa region were down 2%, but grew by 9% on a constant currency basis. And in our Asia Pac region revenues were down 2%, but grew 5% on a constant currency basis. The following are our key product line comparisons to Q1 last year. Enterprise net revenues were $151.8 million and roughly flat to the year-ago quarter. On a constant currency basis, enterprise revenues grew by 3%. That increase was driven primarily by revenues from our UC products. We experienced double-digit growth in the UC category and our E&A, and the Asia Pac regions on a constant currency basis. Consumer net revenues were down 15% and down 12% on a constant currency basis. This decrease was driven largely by a decline in the U.S. Mono Bluetooth market of over 20%. However, we continue to achieve share gains in this market. The decline in Mono Bluetooth was greater than we expected and being driven in part by smaller shelf space allocated to the category in favor of the faster growing stereo Bluetooth category. In addition, Radio Shack's restructuring eliminated an important retail channel outlet and we\u2019re not seeing a corresponding increase through other channels. While we\u2019ve been building our stereo portfolio over the last several years, it is not yet as robust as our Mono Bluetooth portfolio of products. We will continue to invest in the Stereo Bluetooth market to take advantage of this fast moving market. As Ken mentioned, we expect to launch some new consumer products in the near future and received very positive initial reviews. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $70.7 million down $0.5 million compared to Q1 of last year, due primarily to the positive impact of currency movements of $4.5 million. These decreases were offset primarily by higher headcount and related costs and lower litigation gains. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 18.2%, down from 20.4% in the prior year and within our guidance expectations. On a constant currency basis, our operating margin was 18.4%. When you exclude GN litigation expenses of $1.1 million, and the unusual litigation gains we recorded this quarter, the operating margin does not change significantly. Below the operating income line, we recorded interest expense of $2.7 million related to the bond issuance and the previously outstanding line of credit balance. Our effective non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 24.5%. The lower rate is due primarily to lower domestic earnings, resulting from the interest expense on the note. As a result of all of these items, our Q1 non-GAAP net income of $26 million was 21% lower than a year-ago, using non-GAAP EPS of $0.67, down $0.11 from last year\u2019s Q1 result. On a constant currency basis, our non-GAAP EPS is $0.72. We finishedthe -- now turning to balance sheet and cash flow highlights, we finished the quarter with $683 million in cash and investments in our balance sheet and generated over $43 million in cash flow from operations during the period. Of the $683 million in cash and investments at quarter end, $196 million was domestic. We use $284.4 million to repurchase shares during the quarter. We issued $500 million in eight year 5.5% notes and made repayments of $190.2 million on our line of credit. DSO was 55 days down from 63 days at the end of Q1 of the prior year due to improved focus on collections as well as billing linearity that is less heavily weighted towards the back half of the quarter. Inventory turns are 7.1 compared to 6.7 in Q1 of last year, primarily due to improvements in our inventory management practices. Turning to our capital expenditures. Our Q1 investment was $4 million or 1.9% of net revenues. Large expenditures included cost related to the construction of a new smarter working office at our European headquarter site in the Netherlands, an investment in manufacturing execution system for our Mexican plant, and equipment and tooling for our operations. Total CapEx for fiscal year 2016 is expected to be approximately $30 million to $35 million. Depreciation expense on a GAAP basis for Q1 was $5 million, up $0.3 million from the prior year. Now turning to the outlook. We believe total net revenues for our second fiscal quarter ending in September will be in the range of $202 million to $212 million. This forecast assumes gross margins in the range of 51% to 52%, lower than the current quarter margins as currency continues to weigh on our profitability and we expect products mix to have more lower margin UC and consumer products. On a constant currency basis compared with Q2 of FY15, this range would be roughly $210 million to 220 million and at the mid point would represent a decrease of 1% from the prior year. At today's spot rates on the Euro and British pound; we would expect a negative currency impact to revenue of roughly $10 million offset by hedging gains of approximately $2 million for a negative net impact of $8 million. Depending on revenue mix and other factors, we believe our GAAP operating income will be approximately $25 million to $29 million and non-GAAP operating income of approximately $34 million to $38 million. The GAAP reconciling items we expect in the second quarter include approximately $9 million in stock-based compensation expense and purchase accounting amortization before tax. Our guidance assumes that we will spent approximately $1 million on GN litigation in Q2. The GN lawsuit is still in the discovery phase and the impact to operating income from the associated legal expenses is particularly difficult to forecast. Actual expenses can vary significantly from our forecast. On a constant currency basis compared with Q2 of fiscal year 2015, we expect a positive impact to our expenses of roughly $5 million. Therefore, if currency rate do not change significantly, the positive OpEx impacts combined with the negative net -- with the net negative impact on the revenue line of $8 million means our hedging program will protect us from all, but about $3 million in negative impacts to operating income. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter is expected to be 24.5% and we're expecting -- and we\u2019re anticipating a full-year tax rate of the same amount. Based on all of the above, the second quarter, we expect GAAP EPS of $0.39 to $0.47 per share and non-GAAP EPS to be $0.58 to $0.66, on average diluted shares outstanding of approximately $35 million. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Greg Klaben : Hi Leonie, we\u2019re ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Dave King. Ken Kannappan : Hi, Dave. Dave King : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess, first off in terms of the sequential guidance, I\u2019m just curious any color there in terms of how that\u2019s going to shake out by business. I think Pam, in your comments you talked about growth in UC and consumer. But I guess, just in terms of enterprise overall versus consumer, how are we you thinking about that? Pamela Strayer : Yes. So, if you take a look at the midpoint of our guidance, our enterprise and consumer categories would be roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. By region, Europe has a small seasonal decline that they always do in enterprise due to the summer holidays, but it\u2019s offset by increases in Americas and Asia Pac. Dave King : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Ken, taking a step back and just thinking about the macro outlook from where you sit. I think it comes at a little bit of just on some of the energy stuff [ph] and some other things. But do you have any commentary or thoughts around global demand, IT spending, current conversations with some of your customers. Are you seeing any signs of weakness, anything to point to in terms of consumer in China and then in the Americas obviously job turnover is improving which I think generally has done well, I mean, good things for you guys. I guess, just what are the current thoughts there? Thanks. Ken Kannappan : Okay. Well you covered a lot of areas. Let me say that the general tone of business in my mind has actually been more positive than we\u2019re experiencing in my own mind in terms of our results. What I\u2019ve continued to hear is a fairly optimistic tone on the part of most customers in terms of their interest in UC and their plans to deploy that. Clearly, this was not enough to compensate for FX conditions for some weaker economic conditions that we\u2019ve seen around the world as well as perhaps this transition on the UC platform. Nonetheless, if you talk to the customers that we talked to over the past quarter and at the most recent WPC conference, many of the key channel partners, the tone was very, very upbeat and people continue to be pretty optimistic that, that things are moving forward. So we feel pretty good about that. I think that from the standpoint of the consumer market, actually demand for stereo continues to be pretty good. The challenge that we\u2019ve had clearly there has been on the Mono Bluetooth side, where particularly in the U.S., the market declined pretty significantly. And again with that we also had this reduction of channel inventories which if it stops sliding is a one-time item. I don\u2019t know that that is going to reverse. We do hope that the pace is going to slowdown, but I don\u2019t expect that to reverse because that\u2019s just a fundamental use case with fewer and fewer people wishing to have both a voice accessory and a consumption accessory for stereo for their mobile device which is increasingly a texting, entertainment, et cetera device more so than it is a mobile phone. So, if I take all that together, again we still come back feeling very, very good about the 10% growth outlook for the company as a whole strategically. If I talk to your regional point, I would say that within the U.S. to your point again there is a very good tone I think about, with the SME business. I think the oil patch has been hit. I think that the large companies that have got greater foreign currency issues have also been concerned about those impacts. Europe has again benefited some from FX although they have less robust domestic conditions. We had a pretty good quarter in Europe. Certainly, in terms of Asia, we\u2019ve seen stronger performance in India than we did in China, although China was not terrible, it was certainly weaker than it had been. Dave King : Okay. That\u2019s all great color and encouraging in terms of what you\u2019re hearing from the U.S. business. And then, I guess lastly on the subject of capital allocation, of that cash balance, how much of that at this point is held domestically. I think $200 million or so is what I was sort of guessing, but how much of it do you feel then comfortable using on repurchases from here. And then any plans to draw down on the revolver again or increase debt further for further repurchases? Pamela Strayer : Yes. So, Dave the current domestic cash in investment balance is $196 million. So yes, right around $200 million, and we will not be drawing down on the line of credit or draw additional debt in order to buy share repurchases. But we will continue on our approach of returning 60% to shareholders over the long-term. Dave King : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much everyone. Pamela Strayer : Yes, and just to be clear. Sorry, Dave the $196 million was as of the end of the quarter. Dave King : Okay. Right. Pamela Strayer : That\u2019s moved down since then. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of a Tavis McCourt. Tavis McCourt : Hi, guys, its Tavis. Just to follow up on that last one, Pam. Is 60% of the free cash flow generated in the U.S? Pamela Strayer : No, roughly 50% of our free cash flow is located in the U.S. Tavis McCourt : Okay. And then, you described earlier the hedging impact of both the June quarter -- the currency and offsetting hedging impact for both the June quarter and September guidance and then, if I remember correctly roughly similar numbers. When you look forward looking at your hedges, when does that year-over-year comparison on foreign currency get easier for your guys or less harmful? Is it the December quarter or is it more into calendar \u201916? Pamela Strayer : Well I think the December quarter is still going to have some hedge gains, but also some significant currency headwinds. I think it will probably be Q4, our March quarter before that starts to even out a little bit if you recall how currency movement happened last year and all of our hedging instruments where we were entering into hedges for a 12 month period. So I would say it\u2019s probably March before it evens out. Having said that, I think because most of our cogs are in U.S. dollar, even if currencies flatten out a little bit we\u2019ll still have a little bit of gross margin pressure. Tavis McCourt : And I think you mentioned expectations for GN litigation of $1 million in the September quarter. Can you repeat what that was in the June quarter? Pamela Strayer : Yes, it was $1 million forecasted for September and it was $1.1 million in the June quarter. Tavis McCourt : Okay. And then, Ken I think you mentioned Stereo Bluetooth was down year-over-year in the quarter, correct me if I\u2019m wrong in that. But the bigger picture question is, as you look to the Mono Bluetooth market declining, how broadly and how quickly can you expand the Stereo Bluetooth lineup to help offset that? Ken Kannappan : Well, first Stereo Bluetooth was not down. But just to answer your question, I mean I think that, we have a much smaller position in the Stereo Bluetooth market. We have a very large and significant market share in the mono category. So there\u2019s no getting out of the way of category decreases for us, and given our relatively larger size in the mono category that the two are not offsetting. So at the end of the day we are going to be hit by that. We did launch another new product in the stereo are, the BackBeat SENSE that uses a lot of the same technologies that we have in the voyage of focus. We\u2019re continuing to get a pretty good response from the very unique BackBeat Fit will be of component allocation on that in the September timeframe. So we continue to see good growth opportunities there. But again, when we have a really large decrease as we had in the mono category its going to hit us. Tavis McCourt : Great. And I think Pam said that the U.S. business was down year-over-year in the June quarter. With that entirely related to consumer or was the enterprise business down as well? Pamela Strayer : Yes. So year-over-year it was primarily consumer. It was actually a small increase in revenues in the enterprise business that offset that. Tavis McCourt : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from a Greg Burns. Gregory Burns : Goof afternoon. Is there any margin differential between your Mono Bluetooth and Stereo Bluetooth headsets? Pamela Strayer : Yes. So over time we have been working to improve the profitability of our whole consumer line and since our stereo products are more recent products sets, it also has more innovation and that the margins due tend to be higher. Gregory Burns : Okay. And I guess, given what's going on in the Bluetooth market, would you expect that to impact seasonality in the third quarter. Will that be like muted this year based on what's going on? Ken Kannappan : I think we could see a little bit of a mute, and the reason is because even though I think it may follow the kind of the same seasonal trend, the secular trend is declining and I think that will create some muting. The second issue is, I think that there is will be a significant focus on the part of retailers, in the part of advertising around the stereo category around fitness and so forth that I think its going to probably be a negative for the communications category. Gregory Burns : Okay. And the EncorePro headsets that were delayed, I think last quarter you mentioned October timeframe, is that still the same? Ken Kannappan : Yes, I think its going to be about then. Gregory Burns : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from a Mike Latimore. Mike Latimore : Great. Thanks a lot. Yes, I guess just on the UC area, I think in your prepared remarks you talked a little bit about some delays around Skype perhaps. I mean, are you seeing then the general commentary around UC was somewhat positive. I mean are you seeing, if you\u2019re seeing starting to move forward after the new Skype launch here maybe people are getting comfortable with it and starting to deploy a little faster? Ken Kannappan : Yes, we think that there is some momentum picked up a little bit in the market, and I think that part of that is that the market is migrated past the large enterprise to include the SME, where there is just hope of faster cycle to begin with. And then I think the second thing is to your point, it\u2019s a new product. People take a little bit of time to get familiar with it, to evaluate it, to make decisions. I think on the part of the Microsoft sales organization also there is a kind of a new fiscal year in July. And so I think all these things combine towards creating a little bit of a pause in the market and then an opportunity for some restoration. Mike Latimore : I got it. And it sounds like EncorePro is coming out and the Voyager Focus is, I guess just starting to ship recently. In terms of Voyager Focus specifically, how important is that in terms of your enterprise product category. You\u2019ve had other UC products over time, where would you rank this one relative to other UC products in the enterprise category? Ken Kannappan : Well just to be clear, we\u2019re just going to be shipping it within the next week or so. So it\u2019s not actually shipping yet, but referring to the Focus. But I think its going to be a very, very important product, because its -- and it\u2019s really an innovative product that is solving a problem that people have not really had a solution for. So in that context it\u2019s going to be new. It may take a little bit more education. It may take a little bit more explanation for people to get familiar with it, get familiar with its potential. But I will tell you that the people who experienced it and reacted to it, the enthusiasm for it was absolutely overwhelming. I mean we\u2019ve just had a tremendously positive response to that offering. Mike Latimore : And then just two clean up questions here, I guess, what was -- I think you\u2019ve said constant currency growth in EMEA was a certain rate. Could you give that again as well as the tax rate outlook? Pamela Strayer : Sure. On the constant currency basis, the E&A region grew by 9% year-over-year. Mike Latimore : Okay. Pamela Strayer : And our tax rate was 24.5%. Mike Latimore : What do you expect it to be next quarter? Pamela Strayer : Same thing, that\u2019s our annual forecast. Mike Latimore : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : And we have another question. Caller, please state your name. Caller, please state your name. Yi-Dan Wang? Yi- Dan Wang : Sorry, Yi-Dan Wang. Thank you for taking my question. I have several. So first of all on the consumer products, can you give us a -- some sense of what the mix is between mono and stereo movement and what kind of young year [ph] developments you see in these segments? And then, when do you expect these two to cross so that at some point, there should be some growth from those business? Pamela Strayer : So Yi-Dan, we don\u2019t disclose the mix between mono and stereo. We don\u2019t get into that level of detail, but clearly mono is a larger part of our consumer business right now, and when expect those to cross is difficult to say, the combination between growth opportunities in stereo and the mono market itself declining. I\u2019m not sure I can help you with that. Yi- Dan Wang : Right. So, I guess, as it stands at the moment, is there any possibility that you may see across this year -- this fiscal year? Pamela Strayer : I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t believe so. Yi- Dan Wang : Okay. And then what were the relative growth that you see in mono and stereo? In mono, you said the market was down 20%, but you guys gained shares. So roughly some sense of how you performed there would be helpful? And then also in the stereo statement, roughly how fast are you growing with the product that you\u2019ve been launching? Ken Kannappan : Yes, let me add one point of clarification, if I can, Yi-Dan, so on the one hand, we did better than the market as -- and the only data you understand that we get is sell off data from these third party firms. So when we compare our sell off data to these other third party firms we gain share. But our revenues actually decline to more than the category because our revenues are a measure to sell on, and the categories inventories also declined. So we actually dropped more than 20% in terms of our U.S. sell on revenues in the Bluetooth category. Yi- Dan Wang : And that\u2019s for mono or the \u2026 Ken Kannappan : That\u2019s -- I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m referring to mono there, yes. Yi- Dan Wang : Okay. And then the stereo, I think, maybe in your press release you did say that the stereo segment declined, but on the call when you answered a question, you said that it didn\u2019t. Ken Kannappan : Yes, I\u2019m sorry. Just to be clear on that, so the category did not decline. We declined a little bit and maybe I was confused -- confusing in how I answered the question. Yi- Dan Wang : Okay. And why did you decline. I would have thought that, this would be -- given that the market is a much faster growing segment and you\u2019re entering the market where base should be fairly low. Why would you decline? Ken Kannappan : Yes, very fair question. I mean a couple of things. First, the hottest product we have was on allocation. So that was the BackBeat Fit. That obviously doesn\u2019t help you grow with the market. We had in the case of this new product, the Focus it was not yet launched at that point in time. And we had a couple of products that were a little older up against some pretty effective marketing. So we did loose a little share on the stereo side. Yi- Dan Wang : Okay. So, can we expect then that, when the Fit comes back online in September, actually that would probably not make much of a difference for you in the September quarter. So it\u2019s more of a December quarter benefit that we should expect from that product coming out the allocation? Ken Kannappan : Yes, I mean it\u2019s -- I would say part of the September quarter. Yi- Dan Wang : Okay. And the benefit of Focus, would that be fairly immediate or will that also take a bit of time to work its way into the market? Ken Kannappan : Well, I think we\u2019ll get some benefit this quarter, but it won't be a full quarter. Yi- Dan Wang : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the delays that you\u2019ve seen for the types of business that occurred, how quickly -- or do you have a sense of how much volume is being sort of deferred as a result of this and roughly based on your previous experience if whenever Microsoft upgrades those software. How fast we would see that -- see the deferred volume come back to the market? Ken Kannappan : So this is really impossible to assess in terms of size or predict in terms of speed. First of all, as I said that the nature of the market has shifted some from enterprise down to SMEs, so that the cycles are different. Earlier on, the market was less mature. Now this is a much more proven category, so you have a lot more people potentially interested in moving forward on it. It is really, really hard to predict in advance the deployment cycle that people are going to take. And we\u2019ve found this over and over and over again where plants specifically communicated to us were not followed. And so, one thing we know that they won't be followed but on the other hand it\u2019s really hard to predict exactly what it will be. Yi- Dan Wang : Okay. So maybe it would be educational for us to get something, the cycle time for the SMEs relative to the large enterprises? Ken Kannappan : Yes. Well the SME business, I mean we\u2019ve seen a lot of that happen within a, lets just call it -- I mean it depends where you measure the beginning of the sales cycle. But I would say, lets just call it three to six month total sales cycle. Yi- Dan Wang : And the margins part is -- would be. Ken Kannappan : Those have been anywhere from really, one to four years. Yi- Dan Wang : Okay, so much longer. And do you have a sense of roughly how much of your -- sort of demands you\u2019re seeing for UC is coming from the SMEs relative to the large enterprises [indiscernible]? Ken Kannappan : Well we\u2019re still getting more of our business from the large enterprise, but the SMEs is beginning to increase. Yi- Dan Wang : Okay. And then, just hopefully a last question on the Radio Shack -- on consumer product. The Radio Shack effect, how big of an effect was that this quarter and how should we really expect that effect to trend for you over the next few quarters of the fiscal year? Ken Kannappan : Well we\u2019ve already, I mean put it this way. This quarter we had virtually no revenue in terms of our shipments to Radio Shack. The same I think was really true last quarter. So it\u2019s really the comparison to the year-over-year periods and within a couple of quarters that year-over-year effect will be done. Yi- Dan Wang : And what were the comparisons? How much revenue did you get from that last year? Ken Kannappan : I\u2019m not sure that we disclose the specific amount. Pamela Strayer : No, we don\u2019t. It was less than $5 million, but we don\u2019t get anymore specific than that. Yi- Dan Wang : Okay. I have two more, but I\u2019ll take those offline. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Paul Coster. Paul Chung : Hi. This is Paul Chung on for Paul Coster. Thanks for taking my question. Most of them have been asked by the way, but just to follow up on consumer in mono and stereo. Do you see existing mono consumers transitioning to stereo or is this more of a younger demographic first time customer driving the shift? And should we expect some next generation BackBeat lines in time for the holiday season? Ken Kannappan : So, first of all I think that the, from the standpoint of the demographic shift, I think that the primary impact is the -- the primary impact is the switch from people who were buying communications, not buying communications products. They\u2019re either buying it because they\u2019re continuing to use their old communications product so they\u2019ve been continuing to use the legend for quite some period of time and then you get a new demographic into the market who are buying stereo products for consumption for the firs time and I think those are the two primary shift. We don\u2019t see a lot of core business oriented communicators stop and use that. Now I do think there\u2019s been some decrease due to the influx of cars with built in communications into them that has also reduced the market a little bit. Paul Chung : Okay. Thanks. Operator : At this time there are no further questions. Greg Klaben : Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us today. If you have any additional questions, we will be available afterwards. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q2 Fiscal Year 2016 Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Mr. Greg Klaben, you may begin. Greg Klaben : Thanks very much, Sheika. Welcome to Plantronics' second quarter fiscal year 2016 financial results conference call. Joining me today are Ken Kannappan, Plantronics' President and CEO and Pam Strayer, Plantronics' Senior Vice President and CFO. The information presented and discussed today includes forward-looking statements which are made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The risks and uncertainties related to such statements are detailed in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K and today's press release. For the remainder of today's call, we will be providing only non-GAAP metrics related to gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and earnings per share. We have reconciled these measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly analyst metric sheet, both of which are available on the investor relations page of our website. We've also reconciled constant currency in the investor presentation. Note that we have changed the format of our call this quarter to Q&A and that the quarterly prepared remarks on our second quarter from Ken and Pam are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this call will also be available with dial-in information on our press release. Unless stated otherwise, all comparisons of the second quarter fiscal year 2016 financial results are to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. Plantronics' second quarter fiscal year 2016 net revenues were $215 million which includes a charge of $3.6 million for an increase in revenue reserves. Plantronics' GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.52 compared with $0.65 in the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.70 compared with $0.77 in the prior year. On a constant-currency basis our non-GAAP EPS was $0.81 and, excluding the revenue reserve made in the quarter, our adjusted non-GAAP EPS was $0.89. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter consists of charges for stock-based compensation and purchase accounting amortization, both net of the associated tax impact and tax benefits from the release of tax reserves. Please refer to the full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP in our earnings release. With that, we'll open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Greg Burns. Greg Burns : Just had a question about the strong performance in the enterprise segment. Can you just maybe give a little color on what was driving that? And do you think there was any kind of catch-up or pent-up demand from the introduction of Skype for Business? And do you expect that to lead to maybe a fall-off in the coming quarters as that gets worked through? Thanks. Ken Kannappan : Sure. Well, first of all, I do think that there was some, as you normally have, some dip in the market when Skype for Business was introduced. Inevitably people don't necessarily want to go ahead with an older system. Once they get the new one they want to evaluate it. And so there is just sort of a natural dip. And to some degree you could say, okay, that creates a corresponding increase in revenues that's a little bit of both what you might otherwise expect. Having said that, we did expect some of that already. And therefore I would say that the quarter was a little bit better than expectations. And some of that was that the economic conditions were a little bit better than we had expected them to be, particularly within some of the markets in Europe, UK and Germany, within the U.S., than we had expected. And so I would say that. Now, relative to the forecast obviously we've already baked in as it relates to next quarter, our input. As we go past that it's really hard to say. I do think that we feel that fundamentally UC is a growth opportunity. How much? There was kind of a little bit of pent-up that goes away in the immediate following quarter. Hard to say exactly. Greg Burns : Okay. And looks like the guidance is implying sequential increase in OpEx and a little decline in the margins. Could you just run through what's driving that? Pam Strayer : Sure. So, in terms of decline in the margins, our December quarter is a holiday quarter where we tend to have a much higher mix of consumer sales which carry lower gross margins. So we always expect a dip in gross margins sequentially from Q2 to Q3. That's to be expected. Ken Kannappan : I'd make one other comment on the Q3 and Q4 pattern for this year which is unusual. Q3 - and this happens to us because we're on a 52-week fiscal year and then this happens to be a 53-week year. That means that the Q3 in this case is actually shifted a little bit forward, so it's got a lot of favorable dates. Q4 will actually have 14 weeks in it, although it's slightly unfavorable dates. This happens to be a fiscal year with two Easters in it. And we'll get an Easter at the end. And of course the first week of the quarter is the last week of the calendar year which is not a very strong week for us typically. Greg Burns : Okay. But in terms - I think the guidance is implying like a sequential increase in OpEx. Could you just address that and why it's up - Pam Strayer : Yes. So, there's a couple of things going on. We do have some additional legal spend that we're expecting. We've also got some credits that we booked in Q2 related to variable comp that won't be in there. And we've got a lot of other small amounts spread around, some marketing, some small increases in R&D, that type of thing, a lot of small things, no single large thing for me to point out. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Lattimore. Mike Lattimore : Can you talk just a little bit about - I mean, obviously the consumer business probably trends up in the December quarter. But do you see enterprise growing a little bit sequentially potentially? Ken Kannappan : Yes, you\u2019re right. The consumer business does typically trend up a little bit in the December quarter. We're expecting to have a pretty good December quarter as well, both on UC and on the core business. I'd make one other comment. That's kind of a currency-neutral statement. Mike Lattimore : Sure. Okay, yes. Skype for Business is coming out with kind of more of a cloud service a little later this quarter. Does that have any impact on your business, either incremental or potentially cause some pausing to analyze the new offering or anything like that? Or does it not really impact the business? Ken Kannappan : Well, I think that we've seen more and more of the cloud models get implemented and many companies are very interested in moving to that type of model for a variety of reasons. So, to the extent that we have a good solution in the market or another good solution in the market, that is attractive to people it can be a positive in terms of market growth and adoption. I would say that in general those sorts of solutions are also prized by people who are very interested in mobility. And that tends to be a positive it terms of the selection of use of headsets. I think it fits very well some of the models that we've put into place to work with the system integrators in the other channels from a customer standpoint. So I think we'd see this as fairly advantageous. That said, to your other point, can anything create a delay in the market also that's new? Yes, it can. I mean, people can always evaluate something for a period of time before they decide what they're going to do. Mike Lattimore : And then I guess just on the - I'm just curious. I know you don't give us sort of a definitive number, but the ASP for your enterprise business, can you sort of generally talk about the pattern that's followed over the last year or so? Pam Strayer :  Sure. I can take that one. So, we do watch ASPs over extended period of time. And we're not seeing any major changes to that anywhere in the enterprise business, either in core or in UC. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : I understand you've made a move recently to authorized Plantronics dealers only. Could you tell me what the business objective was for that? Ken Kannappan : Sure. What we're trying to do is really help our channels receive a return on the investment that they make in developing customer bases. So these are very commonly implemented by many manufacturers to support their partners in terms of route to market. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And with respect to Amazon, for example, how does that affect Amazon? Are they signed up as an authorized dealer, then? Ken Kannappan : So, I don't want to go into particular customers and answer particular questions, except to say that it is a very broad program that we have in place. And, again, it is intended to preserve the return that those people have in making marketing and other development efforts on our behalf. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave King. Nick Meyers : This is Nick Meyers on for Dave King. I had a jump on late so forgive me if I ask any questions that have already been asked. I just wanted to ask about your 10% reduction you guys are targeting in the supply chain over the next three years. I guess I just want to know how we should be thinking about it in terms of how it's going to flow through to EPS maybe versus being reinvested in growth and new products such as UC. Ken Kannappan : So, let me make sure I understand the question exactly. How we're going to take returns from our supply chain into - whether it's going to be invested into R&D or whether it's going to shareholders? Was that the question? Nick Meyers : Correct. Ken Kannappan : Okay. So we don't allocate specifically where profit dollars are coming from that they are dedicated to a particular source. We have set an overall model based upon the revenue levels that we have as to what we intend to invest in sales and marketing and R&D. And then we make it a little bit more tangible within that broad framework as to the right levels of investment that we think are appropriate based upon what we see in a particular fiscal year. It's always subject to error, in my case of what the actual revenues turn out to be, to volatility as in the case of foreign exchange which has hit us quite a bit. And then ultimately the profits, as we've said before, particularly as it relates to cash flow generation, we intend to pay out 60%, two-thirds in terms of share repurchases, one-third in terms of dividends. Nick Meyers : And just one more thing and sorry again if I missed it. Your December quarter guidance, can you talk about what it assumes for enterprise and, more specifically UC, as well as the consumer business? Pam Strayer : Sure. So, our guidance for next quarter assumes that we've got some low growth. Core is slightly up. UC is up in low-single-digit growth rate. Quarter over quarter, of course, the consumer category would be up and - because it's a holiday quarter for us. So consumer in total would be up by 22%. Enterprise in total would be up around 2%, if you take a look at our midpoint. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Yi-Dan Wang. Yi- Dan Wang : I have a few questions. The first question relates to the comment you made that your income is shifting from lower tax jurisdictions. Can you talk about what is driving that and how we should think about that going forward and the impact on your forward tax rates? And then the second question is, the dynamics that you talked about for the mono Bluetooth across the markets, it seems that that's just happening in the U.S. at the moment. And it would be good to get some color on your expectations for the ex U.S. market, whether that's something that's going to come later that we should think about. And then, the third question also - Ken Kannappan : Yi-Dan, let's just go one question at a time. I'll let you keep going - Yi- Dan Wang : Okay, sure. We can do that. So if you could start with those two, that would be great. Ken Kannappan : So, Pam, why don't you take the first one. I'll take the second one. And then we'll hear what the third one is. Pam Strayer : Okay. Yes. So you asked first about the shift in income between jurisdictions. Keep in mind that that shift is really a comparison to what we were planning on or what we were forecasting. Because our effective tax rate, our effective non-GAAP tax rate, in Q1 was 24.5% and the current projection for the full year is 26.5%. So we had to book a little bit of a catch-up in Q2 and that was because it was different from forecast. And so we're experiencing slightly less revenues offshore and slightly more expenses offshore than we had originally forecasted in that first tax rate. So that's the first part of your question. And then as far as the expected tax rate going forward, the full year expected non-GAAP tax rate is 26.5% at this point. Ken Kannappan : Okay and then, Yi-Dan, I think your - sorry. Yi- Dan Wang : I was going to clarify that. So, when you say there's less revenues offshore, were there any particular countries that we should think about? And it seems that this is a trend that is going to play out for the rest of the year. So do we need to think about it the sustainability of that change? Pam Strayer : Yes. No. So, we always update our forecasting based on the full year. Some of it is currency, certainly. There aren't any particular countries that I'd point out. And, again, it's based on a comparison to our internal forecast rather than any comparison of numbers that we've shared publicly. So, yes. That's all I have to say on that. Yi- Dan Wang : Okay. But are you saying that these are just temporary factors currency related - driven by currency? Or these are going to be something that we need to think about longer term as well? Ken Kannappan : So this is really heavily driven by currency when you get down to it. That's what's, at the end of the day, decreased the amount of revenue and profit that we're generating internationally where are tax rates is lower. And that's what's shifted it into the U.S.. We still have, systemically on the long term, higher growth rates expected outside the U.S. than in the U.S.. So that's kind of the driver to it. Can I proceed with your other question or not? And I just want to make sure I got it, because I think what you said was a question related to the growth rate of the voice Bluetooth market outside the U.S. Is that correct or not? Yi- Dan Wang : So, for the mono Bluetooth market, we've seen quite a lot of, I suppose, release of shelf space by retailers. And it seems that this phenomenon is more U.S. than ex U.S.. So, if you could confirm that is the case? If that is the case, then should we expect the ex U.S. retailers to catch up with this trend over time, at some point? Is that clearer? Ken Kannappan : So, let me make sure I understand this. You're talking about the U.S. catching up with what? Yi- Dan Wang : So, the mono Bluetooth market has been weak this year because retailers, as you've indicated, have been releasing shelf space for mono stereo - sorry, for stereo Bluetooth products. Right? And - Ken Kannappan : Yes. Yi- Dan Wang : It seems that that is really mainly occurring in the U.S. market. Is that the case? Ken Kannappan : Yes. So I think I've got you now, Yi-Dan. So, short answer is the mono Bluetooth market declined much more significantly in the U.S. than it did elsewhere. This is not to say that it has not declined globally. It has declined globally, although a significant portion of that is simply attributable to FX. Yi- Dan Wang : The last bit again? Attributable to-- Ken Kannappan : Sorry. The significant portion of it internationally is simply attributable to foreign exchange rates. Yi- Dan Wang : Okay. So then, the question is, should we expect the ex U.S. market to also suffer the kind of declines that we've observed in the U.S. market, independent of currency, at some point? Perhaps next year? Is there any reason why the ex U.S. markets are not behaving in the same way as the U.S. market on a constant-currency basis? Ken Kannappan : So, let me just say that, first, we don't know because it is kind of a future item. And we were actually surprised by the size and scope of the decline of the market in the U.S.. I think that there is certainly a risk of additional reductions in international markets. Certainly in the case of France there was a change to their regulations that no longer permitted you to use a headset in a car while you're driving in order to make a call. They switched it to other hands-free devices. That's not something that helps out. I think that the mono voice market is likely to continue to decline for a period of time and that there is certainly some risk that the international markets will decline further. We've certainly seen that the much broader adoption that we had for the category in the U.S. was heavily affected by people using smartphones where they frequently wanted to both only pay for and only carry one audio device to go with it. And as those became content delivery for music and other streaming content, increasingly that meant a stereo device rather than a voice devoice. That adoption was not as high overseas. And therefore I think the correction to that market should be lower overseas. But, again, we're dealing with a speculative area on this a little bit. So is there some downside risk to the category going out next year? We think that there is. And I don't know for sure how big it would be. Yi- Dan Wang : Okay. In terms of your revenue mix, how much of your, I suppose, the consumer products are ex U.S. versus U.S.? So if you could somehow reconcile what the potential impact may be, whether it would be as bad as this year - hopefully not, given - I would presume that you have greater contribution of revenues from the U.S. market than ex U.S., but I may be wrong. Pam Strayer : You know, Yi-Dan, I would just assume that it's similar to the full revenue split between domestic and international. We don't provide that level of detail in our revenue categories. So I would assume, you know, roughly 60/40 split, like total revenues are. Yi- Dan Wang : Well, given that you've released a lot of time on your call today, we can ask quite a few questions during that time. But I will just come with one more. So you've talked about consumerization and how some employers are happy for their employees to bring in their own devices. And I suppose that an interesting development may be that you could see the increasing cannibalization of your higher-margin enterprise headset revenues by lower-margin consumer headsets. Can you comment on that, whether that is a risk and how we should think about how that market is developing at the moment? Are you actually seeing such cannibalization happening? Ken Kannappan : Sure. Let me first say - is it a risk? Of course it's a risk because everything is a risk and possible. And there will undoubtedly be some people who'd elect to buy a less expensive product. However, what we're actually seeing in the market has been very encouraging. We've just, as you know, launched the Voyager Focus UC. And I did cover it in the prepared comments that we sent out, but this is a remarkable product. This allows people who are, whether they're consumerized and buy it on their own or whether their company pays for it, getting a product that is one that provides, for sure, fantastic audio experience, great integration into the UC solutions that they're using at the workspace. But this is also one that releases them from all the noise, allows them to focus, allows them to listen to music if they want to, allows them to be a lot happier. Now, the truth is that in consumerization, this means that the individual is more likely to have an influence on what they choose, what they pick. You've already seen in many cases that if it's important to people, they'll pick products they really want. Consumerization doesn't necessarily always mean that the consumer will actually have to pay. It simply means that they are going to be able to choose. Sometimes they may have allowances. Sometimes they may be able to directly bill the company. Sometimes they may indeed decide that they want to pay for the product. But in this case audio, comfort, the sound quality that you get when you communicate, we know these are important to people. And we've repeatedly seen that people are willing to pay for Plantronics quality. And that, at the end of the day, is why we have a leading position in the consumer market today, as well as a leading position in the business market. Yi- Dan Wang : Okay. So, the pricing for the Voyager UC product that you mentioned is more in line with the enterprise headset pricing or is it more in line with the consumer headset pricing? Ken Kannappan : It's in line with the enterprise pricing. It's actually - I mean, it's a new product with some advanced capabilities, so it's a slight premium. I do want to say this is brand new and we've just started shipping it. But, again, it's being extremely well received. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Couple of quick ones, first up, the organic growth rate on a constant-currency basis looks slightly less than your nearest peer. Is there anything that might explain that other than just noise? Ken Kannappan : Well, by our calculations that wasn't really the case. But I would say that your point about noise is valid. I think that most of the things that influence them are the same ones that influence us. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Yes, but I didn't really expect anything different, but - and it wasn't that material anyway, from a headline perspective. But the other question I've got is on the consumer front, is there anything - as we shift from mono to stereo Bluetooth, is there any difference in the way in which you're getting out to the consumer? Is it distributed through a slightly different channel than previously, more sort of big box than specialty and telco channel? Ken Kannappan : Mono to stereo, just to be clear, Paul? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Ken Kannappan :  Yes. So, some of it is the same and then some of it is different. but let me talk - even when it's the same it can still be a little bit different. So, sometimes you have a different part of a story. You can still have Best Buy; you can still have Verizon; you can still have other places internationally. But at the same time, the location within the store where you put voice products may be a less prominent position at this point in time than the place in the store that you put the stereo products. The focus you put on it, who the sales person leads you to, the height on the shelf, a whole bunch of other things and the marketing emphasis in the front store, the amount of flyers you put out, all that type of stuff can create a different level of concentration. So even when we're in the same place it can be different. Sometimes we have different buyers between stereo and mono, even though, again, it is the same store. In addition to that, there can be some stores that only carry one type of product, don't carry the other. That's not at this point in time significant for us from a revenue standpoint. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. So lots of change, but not anything to draw a conclusion in terms of where it's being distributed or revenue momentum. Is that right? Ken Kannappan : Well, no, I mean for us it is primarily being distributed in the same channels although it can be a different location or buyer in that same channel. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. All right. And my last question, Ken, is on the enterprise side, are you seeing any change in the sort of buying pattern, meaning large price versus small versus medium? Large orders versus sort of a trickle of orders coming through from your customers? Is there any sort of material change this quarter or over the last few quarters you'd call out for us that might help us understand behavior of the buyers in aggregate? Ken Kannappan : Well, I would say there's definitely been a change, although I would call it more over the past year than certainly over the past quarter. We've been seeing a steady increase in the portion of the business that is coming from small and mid-size businesses as UC adoption begins to hit those organizations. More of the channels have begun focusing on it. There's more of the born-in-the-cloud services available to those and that's definitely increased adoption in that part of the market. Operator : At this time, ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Greg Klaben. Please go ahead. Greg Klaben : Thanks very much, Sheika. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. If anyone does have any other questions we'll be around this afternoon. Thanks again. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Plantronics' Q3 Fiscal Year 2016 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Greg Klaben, Vice President Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Greg Klaben : Thanks Erin and welcome everyone to Plantronics' third quarter fiscal year 2016 financial results conference call. Joining me today are Ken Kannappan, Plantronics' President and CEO and Pam Strayer, Plantronics' Senior Vice President and CFO. The information presented and discussed today includes forward-looking statements, which are made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The risks and uncertainties related to such statements are detailed in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K and today's press release. For the remainder of today's call, we will be providing only non-GAAP metrics related to gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and earnings per share. We've reconciled these measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly analyst metric sheet, both of which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website. We've also reconciled constant currency in the investor presentation and after the conclusion of today's call the recording of the call will be available with information on our website. Plantronics' third quarter fiscal year 2016 net revenues were $225.7 million. Plantronics' GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.52 compared with $0.71 in the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.83 compared with $0.79 in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter consists of charges for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and purchase accounting amortization, all of which are net of the associated tax impact and tax benefits from the release of tax reserves. Please refer to the full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP in our earnings release. With that, we would like to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dave King with Roth Capital Partners. Your line is open Dave King : Hi, sorry about that. Good afternoon, guys. I guess first off in terms of the restructuring, can you talk about the drivers, the rationale there? Is that more of a response to some of the macro currency pressures and realizing these are earned more of a return overall or is that more of a function of some of the pressures specifically in mono Bluetooth reducing related headcount etcetera. Color there would be helpful. Thank you. Ken Kannappan : Sure. I'll try and thanks for the question. It's really a combination, just to outline this, obviously we have seen a significant reduction in the mono Bluetooth market particularly in the U.S. We had gained a lot of market share in that business, which had masked some of that decrease. But over this past year, what we had really seen is that although we gained a tiny bit of market share, we're really about at the limit. And there were in fact some people exiting the low end of that business and that gave other people an opportunity to increase. But what we found was the retailers really did not want to have any more of the market share concentrated with us. They still wanted to have a little bit of a selection. So we think we've kind of hit somewhere near a peak in terms of our market share opportunity there. What we expect the stereo business to grow and do believe that we will come in the course of probably towards the end of this year a point that the stereo growth will exceed the mono decline. Nonetheless it doesn\u2019t give us a growth engine on that side. So then we're looking at a fairly choppy macroeconomic environment and the FX hits being pretty substantial. We did not want to ignore that impact on our business model. We felt that we are in a really good strategic position and that we could in fact continue to be effective and industry leading with a reduction in our cost structure. So looking at both the mono Bluetooth, looking at our competitive position, looking at the impact on FX, we did want to take a step in the direction of improving our cost structure. Am I answering your question well enough? Dave King : Yeah, I think so. And maybe some follow-ups around it. In terms of then how much of this is just purely headcount versus some of the other things that you may or may not have talked about in the past in terms of SKU rationalization versus I think one of the initiatives you guys had was transitioning more the supply chain from China to Mexico. Are those -- is some of this cost savings coming out of those things as well or is this in specific response to also some of the recent\u2026 Ken Kannappan : Yeah, so this is a specific response. We are continuously reducing SKUs, but in fairness we're also continuously adding SKUs. So we do try to make sure we're doing enough housecleaning there to be cost efficient while at the same time adding innovation on the front end side. We're absolutely continuing many programs in operations including taking advantage of the incredibly low cost position and significant facility that we already have as a fixed cost in Mexico to reduce supply chain cost. This was separate from those initiatives. Dave King : Okay. Okay. Yeah definitely helps. And then maybe going back to the mono versus stereo comments, so in terms of looking at that revenue now, how much of the business is tied to mono versus stereo? And then it sounds like Ken from your comments that the stereo business is still tracking fairly well. Maybe can you just talk about the health of that recent performance of some of the BackBeat products, just any color to give us some comfort there would be great. Ken Kannappan : Sure, so great, there were a few questions there and I'll try to remember them all, but if I miss something, just let me know. So first of all the stereo business has clearly grown as a portion of the total consumer business and at this point in time, actually the mono business is less than half of our total consumer business, now there is a little bit that\u2019s gaming as well. We had a terrific response to some of our portfolio this year, but more to the point, the portfolio -- and we had growth in stereo obviously, but more to the point, the portfolio that we showed at the Consumer Electronics Show or CES in Las Vegas, was really extremely well received. I think that one of the concerns that we\u2019ve had as Plantronics is we're known and we are a communication brand and the depth of the value add that we can provide in communications is truly unparallel. As we were moving into this stereo space, we knew that some of these products were consumption first or music first types of products where communications would be secondary. And so we were worried about our permission to play in these segments and the reception that we would get from some of the key channels. And very clearly what we heard at the CES Show was, your products have been fantastic. Our sales reps are already telling us that these are the best products. The return rates are lower. Word of mouth is very positive, very positive reviews on the websites. So we may not be able to compete with the marketing brands or the budgets of some of our competitors, but the authenticity of the experience is very, very high and the enthusiasm we had for the specific models we showed that were launched over the course of the year was very, very high. So we feel very good about our potential and the ability to compete in that segment. Now, again you asked a number of questions and I am not sure if I remembered them all. So if I missed one please tell me. Dave King : No, no, I think you covered it. You gave me some color on the health of the business and then also just the response in new products and I asked about BackBeat in particular, but I think that sort of talks about new products, so it helps. Just one more and then I\u2019ll step back, in terms of the guidance now for next quarter, sequential guidance if I call it the midpoint of $205 million, it looks like that\u2019s -- you guys are expecting that to be up 2% year-over-year, if I look at that correctly versus down 2.5% in the most -- in the quarter you just reported, I guess how does that break down in terms of enterprise including UC versus consumer then also maybe to the prior point, how are you thinking about the near term outlook for stereo versus mono in that consumer segment? Pam Strayer : So on guidance for Q4 we are expecting an increase of 2%. Most of that is going to be driven by the enterprise business and UC in particular. Year-over-year for Q4, we\u2019re expecting a little bit of a decline in consumer driven primarily by the declines in the mono Bluetooth market. So UC will be the primary growth driver there offsetting declines in mono Bluetooth. Ken Kannappan : So I\u2019ll just talk briefly, on the consumer side clearly we will expect some good progress on the stereo side of the business, but not in terms of this quarter because we don\u2019t really have the benefit of the new launches this quarter. Dave King : Okay. Okay. That's great color. Thanks Ken and Pam and good luck with the rest of the fiscal year. Ken Kannappan : Thank you. Pam Strayer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Paul Coster : Yes, thank you very much for taking my questions. So gross margins came in slightly south of our expectations. I wonder if you can talk to us about the puts and takes in December quarter, but also the guidance, the guidance, I\u2019m finding it quite hard to work with from a pro forma EPS perspective unless I take down our gross margins quite significantly in the back end of this fiscal year, is that a correct thing to do and why? Thank you. Pam Strayer : So first I\u2019ll talk about the gross margin changes year-over-year in our Q3 results. They did come down by over 300 basis points. 120 basis points of that was due to currency impacts and we also had 70 points from some customer mix and product mix. There was also about 100 \u2013 sorry, about 80 points from some pricing changes that we made in order to stay competitive in our international geographies. Paul Coster : And so going forward into 4Q? Pam Strayer : Yeah, we're forecasting some additional pricing impacts in Q4, but our gross margins for our guidance is somewhere between 51% and 52%. So that gives you some idea, I don\u2019t know if that was in the range that you were looking at, but that\u2019s what\u2026 Paul Coster : No, it is, and so it means that you're approaching expenses a little bit higher than - you doing this restructuring, is it not going to impact OpEx. I might have missed something there but\u2026 Pam Strayer : No, let me clarify that, yeah let me clarify that. So due to the timing of our restructuring activities that are happening during Q4, we\u2019re not going to see all of the savings in Q4 that we would expect. So there is a quarter-over-quarter increase in our expectation of operating expense and some of that has to do with variable compensation. In Q3 we saw a benefit of about $2 million from reducing our variable compensation as a catch-up adjustment reducing Q1 and Q2 accruals, but we\u2019re not going to see that benefit again. Paul Coster : Okay\u2026 Pam Strayer : Also, sorry, the bigger impact there going from Q3 to Q4 is really the 14th week, due to the way our fiscal year calendar falls, we have an unusual 14th week in our Q4 this year. It's typically 13 weeks. So that adds about -- that will add over $4 million in operating expense just in the 14th week. Paul Coster : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Just going back to revenues for a moment, the fiscal third quarter, I know you don\u2019t break out UC from corded and wireless office systems anymore, but just directionally where was the growth and where was there no growth -- was UC up double-digits year-on-year or are you just not in a position to share that data anymore? Ken Kannappan : Well we can give you a little bit of color on this. So the UC business on a constant currency base I think it was up about 8% for the year, which is a little bit lower than we had a hoped, but nonetheless positive. The big decline was in the mono Bluetooth business in the U.S., which was off about $8 million year-over-year. Paul Coster : Okay. That makes sense. And then so thinking a little bit further out and you have introduced a whole bunch of new capabilities on your contact center headsets [indiscernible] I think particularly to Enterprise IT in terms of the metadata that can be collected from these headsets now. And you've also seen Microsoft introduce Skype for business. It kind of feels like things should be fairly good in the enterprise at the moment in terms of the reasons to buy Plantronics headsets anyway, but I suspect there is cyclical headroom just to the extent you can give us color here? What is the outlook for 2017? Ken Kannappan : All right. So everything you said is correct Paul. Let me kind of give you what the concerns are and what the pros are. We're certainly hearing a very good response to our new portfolio and I would say globally. At the same time, it's early January that we've assembled this forecast and it's been at best a choppy start to the year from a macroeconomic standpoint. I would say some sectors of both global and U.S. economy have been very affected. And so just talking U.S. economy, very clearly the oil and gas industry has taken a significant hit and that for us is a very, very good sector of the market. We've seen some hits also from the defense contractors aerospace sector and I would say the U.S. exporters such as ourselves who are affected by the dollar, some of course are able to price in dollars overseas, but those who have to price in local currency, this has been a significant impact for them. So I think some of those sectors of the economy have been affected and I think others have been concerned by macroeconomic events. We usually find that this is still early in the quarter to really understand what we\u2019re going to see in the course of the year. And so we\u2019ll pick up more of that intelligence as we go to Enterprise connect and get more feedback. But so far what we\u2019ve heard has been relatively positive, but it's in my mind there is a certain tentativeness just because of macroeconomic concerns, the downgrading of expected GDP growth rates. From a global basis, we actually saw a pretty good quarter from constant a currency standpoint from Europe. I think that the -- never minding the translation, I think that there is actually some room for hope that the position is getting better. On the other hand some of the emerging markets have been very hard hit and some of them were hit before and it's gotten worse. So if I look at areas such as Russia, Brazil, South Africa, China having slowed down, very clearly the oil producing regions and as well as big companies within countries, if you look at Pemex or something like that, Petrobras, which are oil companies in diversified economies these are also weak. So we've got some of those on the negative side. So I think we feel very, very good about the portfolio, the value proposition it provides and what the reaction we're hearing and at the same time, if I looked out longer, I think that there is a risk of macroeconomic headwinds on the negative. Paul Coster : Thank you, Ken. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Burns with Sidoti. Your line is now open. Greg Burns : Good afternoon. In terms of the gross margin and some of the bear comments you mentioned competitive pricing on the enterprise side impacting the gross margin. So I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more color. I think what Pam was saying, it sounded like just dealing with the FX advantages of some of your competitors, but I don't know if there might be anything more going on in the market I think. Ken Kannappan : Sure, let me comment on a little bit. That's probably the smallest of all the factors in terms of gross margin and what I would say there is there is kind of two elements of it. One is we sometimes sell in dollars, but we're really in local currency competition and so that's part of it. And the other part of it is there were some even on the enterprise areas where we had little bit of price competition in Europe. The much bigger effect on the pricing was on the consumer side, and then product mix and FX. So this was a fairly small one. Greg Burns : Okay. And in terms of the OpEx, I guess you gave some color on what to expect in fiscal '17 so up year-over-year, is the first quarter kind of the high water point and then you get some benefits from the restructuring or how should we think about that year-over-year increase in fiscal '17? Pam Strayer : So I believe the year-over-year increase I was referring to was actually looking at Q4 guidance. If we look at the full year FY\u201917, we're going to have cost increases. We've taken $15 million to $16 million out of our annual cost. But one of the big challenges we have is variable compensation is going to come back to 100% for much lower than that this year and that's a big chunk $15 million or more in cost that are going to be coming back as a result of bonuses. We'll also have\u2026 Ken Kannappan : Depending of course on our performance relative to the plan, which is not yet been set for next year. Pam Strayer : Sure right. The plan is not yet finalized. We also have merit increases in healthcare cost and other things in there that traditionally go up year-over-year. Greg Burns : Okay. So the guidance is for the first quarter of '17 to be up sequentially from the fourth quarter of this year and then that's kind of the run rate including all the restructuring benefits? Ken Kannappan : So we haven't actually set guidance for Q1 of next year. All we provided is guidance for Q4, which admittedly is not giving you a perfect understanding of this cost reduction action because obviously it's occurring February 1. Not all of it will take effect for the whole of this quarter. So the full effect of that benefit will be in the next quarter, but we've not yet come up with guidance for the June quarter at this time. Greg Burns : Okay. I am just looking at your prepared remarks and it says we expect Q1 fiscal '17 operating expenses to increase slightly over the fourth quarter. Is that not the case? Pam Strayer : That is the case, yes. Greg Burns : Okay. Ken Kannappan : But again a lot of that is the variable incentive compensation coming back. We haven't put together an actual detail expense as yet for the June quarter. Greg Burns : Okay. And in terms of the accrual reversals this quarter, what was the total amount in terms of dollars and the impact on EPS? Pam Strayer : Well, the way I would think about it is that there was a benefit of $2 million in Q3 operating expenses as a result of the adjustment. Greg Burns : Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Your line is open. Tavis McCourt : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the gross margins in the quarter and the guidance. So to what degree and I think you went over kind of the currency issues and pricing changes and mix, but are you seeing these issues across both categories or is this consumer-only or is it enterprise-only? Ken Kannappan : So let me talk partly to it and then I'll let Pam give you more correct and detailed information. First of all, some of this absolutely cuts across all categories. So foreign exchange cuts across all categories. The lower volumes in the plant, which affects our fixed absorption maybe due primarily to the drop-off in the mono Bluetooth business, but that affects our total business and it affects our total gross margins. Some of the higher logistics cost we had were due to the consumer side of the business where we had much greater volume. On the mix side we had product mix issues that are really kind of very specific to particular products. It was probably a little bit more on the consumer side than it was on the business side and more of the pricing was probably on the consumer side than on the business side, but that's kind of the flavor I would give you. Pam, do you want to correct anything? Pam Strayer : No, I won't correct anything. I will add one thing though. The discount or the pricing impact to enterprise was all international -- into international pricing. So the pricing impacts were much more significant on consumer globally, but when you think about the enterprise, it was internal pressures. Tavis McCourt : Great. And I have a couple of other questions. And then on the consumer business, so if I take a step back and look at the last four quarters, it's actually getting better right, like so it was declining year-over-year much worst four quarters ago. It appears to be getting better. From your guidance next quarter it seems like low to mid single digit decline, but I want to make sure I am reading that right because it seems like you're focusing more on this call than perhaps you have on the last couple of calls. Are we kind of nearing the points where I think you mentioned mono was getting close to 50% of revenues where we might see a flattish or an up quarter in the next four to eight quarters or am I looking at something wrong in the model here? Ken Kannappan : Well, so I think what you just said is reasonable, but let me just say also part of the reason we only forecast one quarter is that our accuracy is not very perfect. So you're asking me for when we'll get to that inflection point where the drop off in the mono category stops hurting us more than the gains in the stereo and we don't know for sure ourselves just to be clear. In all honesty we were surprised that the mono Bluetooth category's decline accelerated this year in the U.S. We were certainly prepared for some decline, but it actually went down much faster than we had expected. So we don't know for sure how much growth the stereo category will have. We don't know for sure how much decline the mono category would have. That means that it was pretty hard for us to estimate for sure where the crossover will be. Having said that, we do think it's kind of reasonable that within a year as we started to get the traction on all of our new product launches, that we will be at or around that zone. Tavis McCourt : Great. And I did have a question on something you should be able to forecast, which is the operating expenses. So if I want to get this right, so part of the increase in the operating expenses in the fiscal fourth quarter was $5 million or $6 million from the added week in the quarter, which makes total sense. Theoretically that should go away in the first quarter of '17 and that would be a bigger number than whatever variable bonuses would be coming in from doing the math right. So I am trying to figure out, are those logical steps correct and if so what am I missing here? Is it\u2026 Pam Strayer : You made one error and that is the variable compensation coming back into Q1, is much larger than the $5 million impact of the 14th week. Ken Kannappan : Let me explain one thing. So there were two elements that kind of -- that in Pam\u2019s comment about the $2 million credit in Q3 I believe, one is that we had a credit for reversal of prior quarter's accrued compensation. But the other one is our accrual for that period was well below a 100% accrual. So when we go back to a regular quarter, we would be assuming we're on plan accruing on the basis of a 100%. So that\u2019s why those numbers didn\u2019t quite add up. Tavis McCourt : No, yeah I understood all that. I had heard Pam say earlier $15 million annual number, and so I was dividing by 4, but may be that $15 million wasn\u2019t inclusive of all the variable cost. Pam Strayer : Yeah, that was about -- that was a quarterly number and includes AIP as well as merit increases and healthcare. So\u2026 Ken Kannappan : There is a few other small numbers, a year ago we had I think a litigation receipt that reduced our OpEx. We don\u2019t have that this year. There is a few other little things. Tavis McCourt : All right, I got. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Latimore from Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jim Fitzgerald : Hi, this is Jim Fitzgerald sitting in for Mike Latimore. Most of my questions have been answered, but I just have a few quick ones here. Going to Skype for business, I know that was touched on once earlier, but have you seen any delays or accelerations in your UC business that\u2019s a result of that offering? And then I guess I would have the same question for Cisco [Swirk] if you've seen any delays or accelerations in the UC business because of that. Ken Kannappan : So I think that we\u2019re encouraged by the new products from our partners. I think that it always takes a certain amount of time having said that for the market to trial, accept them for any issues in the offerings to get smoothed out by the customer base. And so it's just not been the case that we typically get an instant lift off from new offerings. However I do think that there is if anything continued growing enthusiasm. I continue to wish that it took off a little bit more like a rocket ship and less like a barge, but at the end of the day, are we confident that there is growth? Yes, these offerings are better, faster, cheaper than existing solutions. They can meaningfully help organizations operate better, more flexibly, embrace mobility in their workforces, do it at lower cost. Some of the new offerings extend the cost savings opportunities to corporations while extending the capabilities and better supporting both cloud and hybrid architectures that people are very interested in. So I think we feel positive about that, but again I\u2019ve learned that it doesn\u2019t always mean that we\u2019re going to get an instant acceleration of business. I would say one other thing. I think that Microsoft is also very interested in converting a lot of the people who've adopted their UC solutions currently primarily for IM and presence into using more of the license and that would also be encouraging. Jim Fitzgerald : Okay. Great and then what do you guys expect for GN litigation expense in 4Q? I think for 3Q you had expected it to be something like $1.6 million? Pam Strayer : The current forecast is somewhere between $1 million and $2 million in expense in Q4. Jim Fitzgerald : Okay. Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to you, Mr. Klaben. Greg Klaben : Thanks Erin. Thanks everyone for joining us today. If you have any additional follow-up questions, we'll be around this afternoon. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good afternoon, my name is [Delina] and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Plantronics' Q4 Fiscal 2016 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to our host Mr. Greg Klaben. Sir, you may begin your conference. Greg Klaben : Thanks, Delina and welcome everyone to Plantronics' fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 financial results conference call. Joining me today are Ken Kannappan, Plantronics' President and CEO and Pam Strayer, Plantronics' Senior Vice President and CFO. The information presented and discussed today includes forward-looking statements, which are made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The risks and uncertainties related to such statements are detailed in our most recent 10-Q, 10-K and today's press release. For the remainder of today's call, we will be providing only non-GAAP metrics related to gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and earnings per share. We've reconciled these measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly analyst metric sheet, both of which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website. We've also reconciled constant currency in the investor presentation and after the conclusion of today's call the recording of the call will be available with information on our website and our prepared remarks on our Q4 results and outlook are also available on our website. Plantronics' fourth quarter fiscal 2016 net revenues were $209.8 million. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.39 compared with $0.61 in the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.64 compared with $0.72 and the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter consists of charges for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and purchase accounting amortization, both net of the associated tax impact and tax benefits from the release of tax reserves. Please refer to the full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP in our earnings release. With that, I\u2019ll open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Greg Burns with Sidoti & Company Greg Burns : Good afternoon. Just a question about the restructuring that you have in place, and you guess last quarter you were talking about $15 million in annualized savings, sounds like you did have some additional initiatives that you implemented this quarter. So I was just wondering what the cumulative savings are you're looking for how much of that was realized in the fourth quarter, and how we should think about OpEx going in to the fiscal 2017? Pamela Strayer : Yes. So we were able to find more savings on top of what we announced previously. The question is what do you compare that to. And the savings that we had announced before was a comparison to what our original FY 2017 plan was going to be. So I guess what I would say in terms of forecasting OpEx. For Q1 we're expecting our OpEx to be flat to slightly down from Q4 actual. And from that point we're going to manage OpEx so that it grows slower than revenues, so we can improve our operating margins during the year. But other than that I'm not going to be giving any more guidance for the full-year. Greg Burns : Okay. And in terms of SoundScaping, could you just talk about maybe what - how that differs from the competing solutions that are in the market, what kind of interest you're seeing from businesses and then also what you see the total adjustable markets for that kind of service to be? Ken Kannappan : Sure. Well, first of all it's very early days in terms of the market and so let me try to give you a little bit of rundown. Number one most of the other solutions that are in the market are what I would call, comparing somebody doing surgeon with a club to somebody doing laser arthroscopy or something like that. I mean it's just a quantum difference in terms of the performance and as a result of that experience. With many of these other solutions where you have is just a very high level of background noise that people find fatiguing and is not very well targeted to what we're talking about. With our solution you can literally be five to eight feet from somebody have a normal conversation, and yet not disturb somebody who is 12 to 15 feet away. And the effect is very, very subtle, so you don't feel any acoustic fatigue during the course of the day. We think that it's based upon our technology, which we've been working on for years and years and years that results in very high levels of acoustic intelligibility. We are basically doing the reverse of our normal technology where we normally try to make conversations very clear and intelligible and bring people closer together. We are actually doing something slightly different on it, but it gives us a phenomenal technology based upon which we are working. I would say that we have had this in a \u2013 what I would call pre-alpha stage working in our facility for some time. We've been working on the challenge of bringing that out into a general market, where obviously it needs to be somewhat more plug and play, needs to be able to adapt to a variety of different shapes and sizes, different absorptive materials in terms of different frequencies. And so that's work that we\u2019re still not completed with, but having said that we think that we're getting close enough that we \u2013 and we're talking about it and dealing with partners and other people at this point in time that we thought it made sense to be public about it. As a result of this installation, the fact we've had many companies come to visit us. We have in fact realized that there was enormous demand for the product even as it stood now. Virtually everybody who has seen it, the corporations that come to visit us, has wanted to buy it. Again it's not quite ready and so we\u2019ve not sold it as yet, but we know that there is a very high level of interest; fundamentally we're dealing with something that addresses a huge need. As I said in the prepared comments there\u2019s really two camps of people. Those who have already tried to convert to a modern open plan type of environment. We are doing that to break down barriers to improve collaboration as well as to save money on real estate cost and they're finding that they have a big pain point. The productivity of their people is being affected. People are frustrated and unhappy and they don't have any good solution out there. They put in noise dampening systems and solutions, and they wind up making the problem worse. They create a library or \u2013 and almost any sound bothers people, and so they're desperate. And on the other hand, we have people out there, spending a lot of money for real estate that is typically only used 50%, 60% of the time, and they're eyeing all the big real estate cost savings and they're very, very interested in it. And at the end of the day they understand that in order to facilitate that they have to install something like the solution we have. So as you're looking at the workforce out there when we talk to facilities teams and we talk to IT, there is a significant level of interest. Having said that, we are very early in this process and therefore there's a big difference between having people express interest and having people write purchase orders. It's going to be determined over the course of time, when we have a product complete and we figure out how we're going to be able to effectively bring it out to market, what\u2019s the real sale cycle is what the real ramp up is and other things like that. Now, I think there were three questions you asked and I have to confess I can't remember right now, what was the third question? Greg Burns : It\u2019s just related to the addressable market, but I think you somewhat touched upon that I guess it's to be determined? Ken Kannappan : Okay. Good enough. Thank you. Greg Burns : All right. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Dave King with ROTH Capital Partners. David King : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess first off on the improved outlook for the consumer business. Can you talk about what's driving that perception, whether its success with some of the new products in stereo, is it more that mono has turned the corner at this juncture, and then I guess just along those lines where is mono as a percentage of the wireless mix at this point? Ken Kannappan : Sure. Well first of all, yes, the improved outlook is primarily driven by the stereo portfolio and what we're seeing is very good reception of the stereo portfolio. And on the one hand we expect some pickup in Q1 and on the other I would say that more the portfolio will really start to get around the holiday time frame later in the year. I would say as it relates to mono, on the one hand we certainly do expect the category is going to continue to decline some over the course of the year. It\u2019s declined some in Q1. On the other hand, we did have some market share gains in Q1 that helped soften a little bit of that. We're getting a phenomenal reception to our new 5200, which is just been launched. As well as a nice pickup on the [case] [ph] so that further lifts the ASP and so that again helps to offset it a little bit. David King : Okay. And then in mono as a percentage of wireless mix, are you able to share that? Ken Kannappan : Are we sharing that? Pamela Strayer : I guess what I would say is that for next year I mean we do expect mono to decline a little bit, so it\u2019s going to be a smaller portion of the overall mobile mix within consumer. David King : Okay, thanks Pam. And then on the outlook, switching gears for fiscal 2017 assuming that consumer revenues do hold flat as we discussed, UC is up mid-single-digit or excuse me, mid-teens as you guys described. I guess it assumes that sort of flattish in the traditional CC, if I\u2019m thinking about that right. Is that indeed the right way to think about it and I guess what sort of \u2013 what are sort of the puts and takes to that outlook, what\u2019s driving the comfort and just how are you feeling overall about that part of that business? Ken Kannappan : So I am going to disaggregate a little bit and talk about one piece and if this wasn\u2019t the entire question then just let me know, but if we're talking about the core OCC business, what we believe is that actually it's been declining a little bit and actually we expect it will continue to decline a little bit. Now within core OCC, the macro economic factors tend to be very, very large relative to business. So starting off with foreign exchange rates this is a very large determinant of what we actually realize in a relatively flattish kind of economic environment. I would say that relative to GDP growth, again we're not yet seeing what we would call truly robust economic conditions driving high levels of voluntary turnover and accelerating our replacement cycle. So what we see is a relatively flat market, a slight decline as we do see UC growth and while most of that growth is incremental. There is a small part that at the end of the day is cannibalizing it. I would also say that we've seen \u2013 we continued to see an extension of the replacement cycle in our core business and that's been a slight negative on that market as well. David King : That answers it perfectly. Thanks for the color there. And then I guess lastly with regards to the as a service and maybe SoundScaping as well. Can you talk about the economics of those initiatives, margin profiles you alluded to I think a little bit maybe on the SoundScaping, but I understand it\u2019s early. And then does that mean transitioning to more of a subscription model over time. What should that mean for revenues and then did that play at all in that decision to take down the longer-term topline outlook. I think you guys are thinking about 10% long-term growth previously announced. It sounds it\u2019s mid to high single-digits, so any color on economics would be\u2026 Ken Kannappan : So I\u2019m going to try to answer it, if I missed part of the questions just remind me. So let me start with margins, so relative to these new areas \u2013 subscription areas, we do see them as being substantially higher margin than our existing business. Let me start with the data inside modules, the software-as-a-service areas that we announced earlier today and we would be adding additional modules over time to this. At the end of the day, this is really leveraging the data insights that we\u2019re already able to gather and providing them to our customers and what we think is value add for their business allowing them to manage their business more easily, get information that they really want. And so we see this as a very high margin overlay as a level of value add on our existing business. And relative to the SoundScaping, again I would say this is early stage and so in the early stages many of these models you have to figure out what is going to be the OpEx required to go-to-market and to be successful, but the intrinsic gross margins of the product should be very attractive. Most of the value add is in the algorithms and so while we do need to obviously put some sound equipment and other server and so forth on locations most of the value add being really technical in nature the margins on that should also be higher than our regular business.  Device as a service, we see that as being embryonic at this point in time, but it should have some attractive margin characteristics it should reduce the replacement cycle for our products which is attractive from a P&L standpoint. So we see all these as being better. Now in terms of subscription models over time, and the growth rate, we have not attempted to add those into as yet the growth rate for our revenues. I would say that the lower rate that we see out there is really a reflection of the fact that number one, the UC market is not grown as much as we wanted and it's not at least imminently showing a sign of having a higher growth rate that would lift the total enterprise business. We've still been in a fairly sluggish macroeconomic environment and it's not clear that that global GDP number is rising. From a consumer side the mono category again is not showing great opportunities for growth and so that leaves us with the service side growing well. So this is a reflection of our view as well as third party analyst views of where we think the market growth is likely to be. David King : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Great color. Nice quarter and good luck with fiscal 2017. Ken Kannappan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question come from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Paul Coster : Yes, thanks for taking my question. So the current revenue growth outlook 6% to 7% or rather [\u201817] is low-to-mid single-digits, the longer term is 6% to 7%. Ken, can you just talk just a little bit about why the sub-secular growth trajectory near-term and what the puts and takes are in your guidance in terms of the risk? Ken Kannappan : Sure, I'll try. Well I think that you know right now we are in terms of the guidance we're not seeing a higher level of UC adoption to be a driver at overall higher level while we're still in again this relatively soft macroeconomic environments not a bad economic environment, but it's not a robust one. So you know most of our replacement cycle business, there is not a driver near-term that says hey this is why we're going to see a cyclical rebound. On the side of the UC side, while we\u2019re seeing continued growth and there are some causes for optimism that could make it grow at a faster pace. We think it's unlikely that we're going to see a significant pick up over the near-term, there's not enough in progress to make that seem likely. It's always possible. We think it is more likely to happen longer-term. I think that the products and solutions are absolutely outstanding at this point in time. There's no question that this offers a better cheaper solution for customers. Many of the born in the cloud PBX players are seeing very, very good growth. We think that that a lot of these offerings are ready for people to adopt and therefore should have better attach rates for us. If I look at kind of the near-term puts and takes to answer that part of your question, clearly in a very near-term way you know we can get lumpy UC business, they can help us a good deal. It certainly got the potential for positive effects on the FX side as well. I would say that on the stereo consumer side and on gaming we do have a very nice new portfolio and we could see traction in those, better than what we expect. On the negative side, I would say it would primarily be a risk in the core space that the growth is sluggish, the economy is not very good. I mean, obviously there is an 0.5% U.S. GDP growth which is not a wildly robust number. And then on the mono Bluetooth side again there's always risk that we could see further contraction in that segment. Paul Coster : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Latimore with Northland Capital. Jim Fitzgerald : Hi, this is Jim Fitzgerald standing in for Mike Latimore. So for my first question here I just want to start on the macro level. Have you guys have been customers four channel partners pausing lately to evaluate economic news such as what we're seeing in China, or have the bookings there that linearity been pretty normal? Ken Kannappan : So I would say that more of the pause that comes from macroeconomic tends to come at the system level rather than a headset level and then we tend to follow that. Relative to an economic headline, it is extremely rare for a Company to put in any kind of pause on smaller purchases at the level that we operate. To the extent that they're really worried by headlines then they might delay installation of an upgrade or a new system or something like that. Even then I would say it's fairly rare. Normally by the time you're ready to implement those plans you've got a lot of sunk investment in time and effort and you have another system that you are planning to end of life and save those license payments and so you tend to go ahead. I would say that it's usually more of a slightly longer cycle delay that it hits the sales cycle rather than at the very end of the funnel. Jim Fitzgerald : Sure. And then can you talk about the Voyager Focus product a little bit. I know you mentioned in our prepared remarks that you're happy with the reception that product received. Can you elaborate a little bit on that? Ken Kannappan : Sure. I mean back to kind of what I talked about with our SoundScaping solution, right now today the only way to really deal with that environment if you're in it is to have your own private cocoon, and that's what this product is offering. It\u2019s offering you the ability to avoid distractions, shutout the noise it's near you, and at the same time to make conversations, communicate effectively do what else other that you\u2019re looking to do. So for those sorts of environments at the leading edge it is really been a fantastic product, separate from that you can use it anywhere. So I mean I can use that product if I\u2019m sitting at a Starbucks and I'm the sales person or any other location that I wanted to do it. We have people using it on planes and they\u2019re listening to conference calls. Now over Wi-Fi they\u2019re presumably not talking and annoying their neighbors, but nonetheless it's a fantastic product, very differentiated in the market. Jim Fitzgerald : Okay. Great. Thank you. Nice quarter. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Tavis McCourt : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. In the prepared remarks you made a comment that the first quarter is going to be \u2013 have a benefit from a one-time royalty payment? Can you just discuss maybe the size of that? What it's related to and if I plug in your guidance, it looks like your gross margins are going to be up a bit sequentially, is that because of that royalty payment and in anyway to talk about how if the core gross margins trending I think you mentioned in the last call being a little cautious on that. And I'm wondering if you're seeing improved ASP trends in the market? Pamela Strayer : Yes. Hi, Tavis. So on the royalty revenues, what we're expecting there is about $2 million and this is ongoing royalty revenue we've had for a while, we just end up with an unusually large chunk of it in this quarter which we don't expect to recur. So we do expect like 50 basis point improvement as a result of that. Going forward I would say gross margins including Q3 there are going to be right in a range of 50% next year and then depending on product mix with Q3 being at the lower end of that range. Tavis McCourt : Pam, I missed you. You went out when you said what range 50 to what percent? Pamela Strayer : Sorry, 50% to 52%. I think in the past we would tend to go a little bit north of 50%, because the currency I\u2019m expecting it to stay within that range\u2026. Tavis McCourt : Got you. And then two follow-ups, it\u2019s been a few quarters since you called out legal costs and I'm wondering are those de minimis now or are they still running in the same range as they are always been. And then it looks like the international growth in the quarter was probably as good as it's been on a year-over-year basis in four or five quarters. I know the extra week helps, but was there anything else even if you adjust for that it looks like it was materially better than last quarter, any glimmers of hopes in some of the geographies where you mentioned some relatively extreme weakness on the last conference call? Ken Kannappan : Why don\u2019t you do the legal? Pamela Strayer : Yes. On the legal costs, they have been running between on the GM litigation somewhere between $1 million and $2 million a quarter. And that's roughly what we expect going forward as well. Ken Kannappan : So let me turn to the international business and you're right. It was a good quarter internationally. We actually saw really across the Board by which I mean both Europe as well as Asia Pacific. Pretty good conditions and actually we\u2019re continuing to see that right now. Tavis McCourt : Great, thanks a lot. End of Q& A Operator : There are showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Mr. Klaben for any closing remarks. Greg Klaben : Thanks again everyone for joining us, we are available afterwards if you have any follow-up questions. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Plantronics\u2019 First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Mr. Greg Klaben. You may begin your conference. Greg Klaben : Thanks, Lutavia. Joining me today are Ken Kannappan, Plantronics\u2019 President and CEO; Joe Burton, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Pam Strayer, Plantronics\u2019 Senior Vice President and CFO; and Rich Pickard, VP, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. The information presented and discussed today includes forward-looking statements, which are made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The risks and uncertainties related to such statements are detailed in our most recent 10-Q, 10-K and today\u2019s press release. For the remainder of today\u2019s call, we will be providing only non-GAAP metrics related to gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income and earnings per share. We\u2019ve reconciled these measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly analyst metric sheet, both of which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website. After the conclusion of today\u2019s call, the recording of the call will be on our website. Plantronics' first quarter fiscal year 2017 net revenues were $223.1 million. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.62 compared with $0.55 in the prior year. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.76 compared with $0.67 in the prior year. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter consists of charges for stock-based compensation, and restructuring charges, all net of the associated tax impact, and tax benefits from the release of tax reserves. Please refer to the full reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP in our earnings press release. With that, I\u2019ll open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from line of Dave King [ROTH Capital Partners]. David King : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess first off on the strength of consumer. I guess few questions there. Can you talk a bit about what\u2019s driving the double-digit growth in stereo and to what extend I mean obviously back it's been pretty successful but I guess to what extent do you think that share gains versus end market growth? And then as I think about mono, I guess that was the growth there was a little bit better than I would have expected as well just given sort of what's happening with end markets maybe you can touch on that a bit? And then maybe lastly on the consumer \u2013 maybe just can you talk a bit about the opportunity in gaming and some of the successes you had? Thank you. Ken Kannappan : Sure. This is Ken. I\u2019d start out with the answer on these. So first of all on the stereo side, yes, we benefited both from a buoyant market which was growing but also obviously we grew above that with some brand new products doing extremely well in terms of expanding our position in the market. Just to give you a rough sense, I would say probably about half of it represented buoyancy in the market and about half of it represented market share gains. I think you asked about mono side as well, there we don't think that market is doing that well and we think this is primarily market share gains on our side due to a new product. On the gaming side and if we get exactly the question there but because that we had some new products were well received. Having said that we're still at a fairly nascent stage in our business, we will be adding more to our portfolio later this year and continue to ramp this over time. I mean there may have been enough items to your question that I may have missed one or two. So if I missed something. Please let me know what I missed. David King : Yes. No problem, Ken. I think that was great. Actually I'm switching gears a bit on the SaaS side, congrats on the 50 customers it looks like you've signed up there. Is there anything you can share with us in terms of how to think about the economics of that longer term you think, you need to ramp that? Ken Kannappan : Sure. Well, first of all let me just say honestly, when you still have heads that right now you get all the revenue right away. In this case we're dealing with this monthly subscription so just to consider the financial impact to be very modest over time and it actually requires, therefore fairly large portfolio. But having said that there's no downside after you sold the initial unit, you're continuing to get revenues and it is an extremely high margin revenues. And as we\u2019ve broaden that out to more and more customers, we do expect to have a very nice addition to our profitability. And of course this is the other part of it adding significant more value to our customers business and being a more valued partner. David King : Ken, that\u2019s a good color and then one more, if I may in terms of the guidance, I think it's 2% year-on-year growth, if I saw that correctly. Can you talk about how you're thinking about that for next quarter in terms of how that breaks down between you see core enterprise and consumer? Pam Strayer : Yes, Dave, this is Pam. I\u2019ll take that one. On our guidance what I would do is our Q2 guidance that we are offering is very similar to our Q1 result, there's only a small dip in revenues and I expect our revenue mix for Q2 to be pretty similar to what we did in Q1. So we will have strong \u2013 we do expect to have strong year-over-year growth in consumer for another quarter and growth in enterprise as well, enterprise being maybe flat up a little bit with growth there coming from UC. David King : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks Pam and then lastly. Thanks Ken for all your contributions and good luck with your retirement. Ken Kannappan : Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mike Latimore with Northland Securities. Nick Altmann : Hey, guys this is Nick Altmann filling in for Mike. Couple of quick ones, are you guys seeing any delays around Skype deployments. Given that there is a little bit more emphasis on the cloud now? Ken Kannappan : Our actual belief is, this is going to be a positive and let me just explain why? Number one, in fact a lot of the people that are focused on that model whether you call it managed services cloud hosting type of stuff, for them this is a fantastic fit. I think for businesses they\u2019ve learned that Office 365 represents a wonderful scalable flexible opportunity for them to deploy the technology. I think for the Microsoft sales force is represents a kind of like I was talking about with our monthly subscription also a need not to backend load their quarters and their fiscal years, they have to get that out there. I think across Microsoft, they\u2019re really interested in converting some of those licenses which are only active on IM in presence and not yet active on voice. So we actually believe this will be positive, now having said that it doesn't mean that its instantaneous like a switch and going to be a sudden mountain, but nonetheless we think this is going to be positive over the course of the year. Nick Altmann : Okay, thanks. And then I guess\u2026 Ken Kannappan : I think if I could mention I mean it also is a perfect reinforcement for our SaaS businesses. Sorry go ahead. Nick Altmann : Okay. Thanks. And then yes, I guess nothing has been confirmed yet but there's been some rumors that the new iPhone, potentially might not have a headphone jack and I'm just wondering how you guys are thinking about that and if you expect to benefit a little bit more if the new iPhone doesn't have a headphone jack? Ken Kannappan : So we do think it's positive, obviously it represents a different replacement. So I think that talk to that a little bit and Joe just have why \u2013 because he\u2019s still slightly new on the calls, he won\u2019t conform or deny things that we know, even if they are semi-public. Joe Burton : Yes. Thank you very much for that, Ken. Essentially Ken already gave \u2013 already gave the way we feel about that clearly we see the ability to add more value when it's a wireless connection or a digital connection as opposed to an analog connection like a 3.5 millimeter jack. So net-net a move away from a 3.5 millimeter towards something digital and intelligent actually it should be overall positive for Plantronics as an industry direction. Nick Altmann : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Burns with Sidoti. Greg Burns : Good afternoon. I missed the beginning of the call. So forgive me if I'm repeating anything but I just want to dig in on the strength in consumer, was there anything in particular driving the strength as you're seeing in the first and guiding for that into the second quarter. And is this kind of a base level to build the balance of the year off of as we going to the kind of the stronger seasonally part of the year or should we expect maybe a falloff from these levels? And then secondly, do you just give us the mix of the percent of revenue coming from mono versus stereo, we crossed over in terms of stereos contribution yet? Ken Kannappan : Sure. So let me try to answer both of those questions. First of all, the primary driver was both are great new portfolio products we had. But also a very, very good market for stereo, so clearly the growth was strongest in stereo during the quarter. I think that the short answer to your crossover is ironically we actually had growth in the mono side as well, largely behind a new product, even though new category there is not buoyant. And so we have not yet reached the crossover point even though we did have revenue growth, so mono is still larger than stereo. In terms of what's the model going forward. We actually do expect the stereo business to grow, which doesn't mean that there weren't some initial loads in the quarter there were, unless there's still new products coming and we are seeing very good sell-through. So we\u2019re still expecting to see growth from this level. Greg Burns : Okay, thank you. And then just one on SoundScaping, I was wondering as you look at, can you just give us a sense of how you're looking to price this product, relative to the competition. Maybe not exactly, I'm not looking for exact pricing but maybe there is going to be a premium to what's out there. And how you\u2019re gong to position the products relative to the competition and also how are you going to go to market, is it going to be a direct sales effort or through channel? Ken Kannappan : All right. I'll try to answer these questions, again we're not going to go too much into this because it's really premature and we're going to share a business model and more on the go-to-market following our fiscal year end conference call which we think will probably be the beginning of May of next year and really will be which I\u2019ll sharing at that point in time. I'll give you a few pieces of color on this right now. And first we do think it is unique technology, we do think it is a dramatically better solution. It is not fatiguing like those other solutions are and at the end of the day for most companies that we have talked to, we represent the only solution that they see, they can really do what they want to allow them to a save huge amount of real estate cost redensification, but in their minds even more importantly improve the productivity of their people in the kind of collaborative environment they want to have for their key talents. So we feel this is absolutely a premium offering and it's much more to it as well, the system is dynamic, it\u2019s adaptive, its self-diagnostic, it's going to be upgraded through additional features. And so we view it as night and day different. In terms of route to market, it is going to go, it is going to have to be not direct, but we will support in the initial phases, we will need channels that are experienced in this sort of thing to install it. And so we will be \u2013 we will absolutely be maintaining our channel driven our overall business model. Greg Burns : Okay, thanks. And in terms of the SaaS offering I see you have 50 customers now using that product, what\u2019s the average ARPU of a typical customer? Ken Kannappan : So, I don't know if we\u2019re disclosing that. I can ask Pam if we disclose, I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re not disclosing that at this time. Greg Burns : Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Paul Chung : Thanks. This is Paul Chung on for Paul Coster. Thanks for taking my question. So my question is on gross margin with product mix shift movement that you see do you expect some pressures on long-term gross margin target and can you give us a sense of pricing flexibility for UC products and the firm increased ASPs on these products as demand increases if you don't mind what\u2019s your traditional content compact assets? Pam Strayer : Yes. So I will start, Ken may have more to add on this. But on in terms of gross margins, I think we talked a long time about the fact that our UC products have an average product margin that's right in line with our long-term target of 50% to 52%. So with the percentage of UC revenues increasing over time that should be a problem for us, that should just keep us on track to our long-term target. Pricing and margins and you see have been very steady and we watch that carefully over time. It\u2019s been very steady for us. Paul Chung : Okay, so\u2026 Ken Kannappan : I was going to make an adding comment. I think that what Pam said is true, when we add in businesses like SaaS and like SoundScaping we think those represent a significant high margin additions to our business it over time represent upside. Paul Chung : Okay. And then from our model based on $1 billion cumulative UC sales by 2Q could just similar year-on-year growth rate if not higher and you see if my assumption correct and I know visibilities low longer term, but how do you see UC shaping up in the second half? Pam Strayer : Yes. So our guidance would assume that UC growth year-over-year growth rates for Q2 are similar to what we experienced in Q1. And for UC for the rest of the year, Ken do you want to address that question? Ken Kannappan : Well, I mean as always we believe that you see can be a little bit erratic. So having said that as you say we do think we're in a fundamental secular growth situation. As I commented earlier relative to Microsoft same can be true with other vendors, we\u2019re continuing to see growing ASP since of these sorts of solutions they represent faster better cheaper at the end of the day for companies, better flexibility, lower cost, better contingent performance increasingly easier to manage. And so we continue to expect further increase in adoption which over time again will grow our business. Paul Chung : Great. And just want to say thank you, Ken for all your insight over the years and we wish you the best. Thank you. Ken Kannappan : Thank you very much. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Mr. Klaben. Greg Klaben : Thanks everyone again for joining us today. If you have any additional questions, we will be available afterwards. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Please refer to the full reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP in our earnings release. I\u2019d like to provide a brief update on our GN Litigation. Despite a previously reported unfavorable ruling and the imposition of sanctions by the court in July 2016 in connection with certain discovery matters in the litigation, we continue to believe the underlying antitrust action is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the action. Trial of the underlying antitrust case is currently scheduled to commence in October 2017. Given it\u2019s Joe\u2019s first quarter as President and CEO, he will be reading a portion of his prepared remarks, after which, we\u2019ll open the call for questions and answers. If you haven\u2019t received them, the full portion of Joe and Pam\u2019s remarks are available on our corporate website. Finally, I\u2019d like to let you know that Joe, Pam and I will be presenting at the Raymond James Conference on December 8th, and also holding one on one meetings. We hope to see you there, and if not, the event will be broadcast. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe. Joe Burton : Thanks, Greg. And thank you all for joining us today. As you know, this is my first call with you as President and CEO. And while I\u2019ve met several of you in the past, I\u2019m looking forward to getting to know you all better over the next several quarters. I\u2019m honored to be entrusted with the leadership of Plantronics, and as we discussed in our August 2nd earnings call, Ken and I\u2019ve been working together closely over the past several years, along with our management team and Plantronics associates to develop our long-term strategic direction and investment decisions related to our Innovation Waves. The Plantronics brand promise will continue to be the creation and development of simple, reliable and easy to use communications solutions that are acoustically excellent. Our brand promise, combined with our hardware and software vision, are being enthusiastically embraced by our customers and partners. We continue to define the industry and are well underway in extending our strategy in some pretty exciting ways. Our key objective at Plantronics continues to be the acceleration of growth, both at the top and bottom lines, while investing in new growth opportunities, which we\u2019ll be discussing further in this call and in future quarters. I\u2019d like to cover a few Key strategic points before we review the quarterly results. First, we believe our current cost structure will improve operating margins this fiscal year and in subsequent years. Second, despite ongoing sluggishness in the global economic environment, and a strong dollar, we are targeting improved top-line and operating income growth for this fiscal year. Three, our headset and software solutions in both enterprise and consumer markets remain highly differentiated, and our competitive position in both categories remains strong. Fourth, existing growth opportunities in our current businesses are healthy, and we expect additional growth through strategic investment in our Innovation Waves. Our Innovation Waves enable us to have higher level conversations with our customers and partners to solve broader business and IT problems. We believe these conversations are resulting in stronger industry alliances and increased customer loyalty. Here are some key points on the second quarter, all comparisons are year-over-year. The business delivered solid results in Q2 FY17, in what continues to be a sluggish macroeconomic environment. While revenue growth year-over-year was 0.5%, our year-to-date results reflect 4% growth, in line with our outlook for the full fiscal year. Our second quarter revenue growth was driven by double digit gains in both the Unified Communications and Consumer product categories. These gains were offset by a decline in Core Enterprise headset sales. Mono Bluetooth revenues grew in the low single digits year-over-year. These revenues grew year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter, driven by a successful launch of our new Voyager 5200 this past May, and are a reversal of the revenue declines we previously recorded in the mono Bluetooth category in the fiscal year 2016. This resulted in a record market share in U.S. retail sales. We achieved significant increases in stereo Bluetooth headset sales driven by new product introductions and increased retailer placements. R&D and SG&A expenses together increased at a slower rate than revenues for the second consecutive quarter, with R&D and SG&A together declining slightly year-to-date. Our 19.6% operating margin for the quarter and 18.4% operating margin year-to-date are in line with our goal to improve operating margins for the year. Earnings per share increased by 17% to $0.82, and our year-to-date EPS was $1.58, compared with $1.36 the prior year-to-date period, a 16% increase in EPS. We\u2019ve discussed our three Innovation Waves in the past, but I\u2019d like to review them briefly. Our first Innovation Wave is Taming Communications Chaos. Here, we\u2019re providing devices and software tools that minimize the complexity of using and managing headsets, and furthermore gives IT departments unique insights into the operation of their Unified Communications systems. This enables us to create a seamless experience for users as the world of devices and apps grows ever more complex. We remain at the forefront of this opportunity, with an approach unmatched by our competitors. Our second Innovation Wave is In The Zone. We enhance user productivity by minimizing distractions and preserving focus. For instance, we are adding active and passive noise reduction to our headsets and are developing our Soundscaping technology, a new software and hardware solution that reduces noise distractions in open office spaces. Our third Innovation Wave is Smarter Customer Interactions. This is about providing our enterprise customers with data insights about sound quality, conversational health, communications software compatibility, and other attributes that impact their customer experiences. Thanks to our investments in software, we have developed unique capabilities to report realtime actionable data that helps customers improve service and lower costs. Initial customer interest in our solutions is even stronger than we had anticipated and we\u2019re bringing new data insight capabilities to market as quickly as we can. At this point, I\u2019d like to open the call for Q&A, and as Greg mentioned, additional commentary from Pam and me is available on the IR portion of our website. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Burns from Sidoti & Company. Your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Coster from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Paul Coster : Couple of questions about the Core Enterprise business. I noticed, Joe in your prepared remarks you talked of how the move to cloud-based solutions may be impeding some of the sales in that segment. Can you just elaborate on that? And why that you should be -- is that transient or is that a permanent state I guess moving forward? And I\u2019ve got one follow-up. Thank you. Joe Burton : Hi Paul. Thanks very much for the question. First of all, your question whether it\u2019s transient or permanent, very much transient, in other words temporary. We really believe that the decline in the Core Enterprise that we talked about, isn\u2019t related to market share losses. We think that indeed some of the shift to cloud that we\u2019re seeing right now has paused a few deals in the market. But we do expect to resume the 0% to 1% growth rate in that area that we\u2019ve committed to in the past. Paul Coster : And then on the UC side, we obviously saw this big surge, and I\u2019m not complaining about the growth rate at the momentum; it\u2019s not bad but it slowed down a little bit from the March, June periods. So, I\u2019m wondering is it possible that we\u2019re kind of through the hump of activity that might be associated with this cloud for business deployed and sold or is there some other reason why we\u2019ve decelerated at least in the September and December quarters from my record? Joe Burton : Yes. Not really, Paul. We still think the great bulk of the UC opportunity is in front of us as we said in the past. UC tends to be big deal driven. We may have a had a couple of extra big deals fall into one quarter versus the other. But we\u2019re still very comfortable with UC growth in the teams as we said in the past and we think that will continue. Paul Coster : I\u2019ve got one last question. I do to apologize and I feel like I am picking things when actually these pretty solid results. But the other question I\u2019ve got is the gross margins have basically been trailing down very, very modestly over the last five or six quarters on a year-over-year basis. What\u2019s going on there and do you expect that reverse quarter some point? Pam Strayer : So, Paul, I\u2019ll respond to that. Our gross margins this particular quarter were down year-over-year just because of the higher mix of consumer. I think in the past, we\u2019ve always playing to our target range gross margins to be 50% to 52%; we were exceeding that for a while. But we\u2019d always expected it to come down into that range as we\u2019d make a stronger shift towards UC revenues away from Core Enterprise and then Consumer is growing, that\u2019s just adding to the mix shift and causing margins to come down. Joe Burton : But just within that category, that range. Pam Strayer : Yes, within that range. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt from Raymond James. Your line is open. Tavis McCourt : Hey everybody. Thanks for taking my questions; I\u2019ve got a few. First, in terms of guidance for the December quarter. Are there any more transitional expenses related to Ken\u2019s retirement in that guidance? And then, can you give us an update on lawsuits, expenses heading into the October trial and whether or not that will be included in non-GAAP results or not? Pam Strayer : Yes. Hi, Tavis, this is Pam. With respect to your first question on transition costs, we are not expecting anything significant in there. Ken is still working part time. There are some costs associated with that but very small, so no large charges next quarter. On the GN case, we are forecasting like we typically do. We expect costs there to be about $1.5 million, next quarter. They typically range from $1 million to $2 million and it does vary depending on what activities are going on. With some depositions coming up, it will probably be $1.5 million to $2 million next quarter. Tavis McCourt : Okay. And you\u2019re including those expenses in non-GAAP? Pam Strayer : That\u2019s correct. Yes, consistent with how we\u2019ve done it. Yes. Tavis McCourt : Okay. And then, yes, I recognize that both this quarter and last quarter, it doesn\u2019t seem like foreign currency really had a material impact. But, can you outline what your pound exposure is from a revenue perspective and how much of that is covered by hedges and for how long? Pam Strayer : Yes. So, we don\u2019t give specific currency exposure but I will tell you it\u2019s low to mid single-digits in revenue in that currency. The exposure -- we continue to hedge that exposure like we always have which we kind of target 70% of revenues being hedged. So, we do have a little bit of exposure there for positive or negative news but the majority of it is hedged and has been hedged. Tavis McCourt : And a couple for Joe, I think. First, although I recognize the numbers are pretty small, it looks like it was kind of the strongest quarter in the Latin America or I guess in Americas ex-U.S. that you\u2019ve had in a number of quarters. Is there any specific going on in that region? And then, we\u2019ve been hearing of -- I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the only one with strength in stereo Bluetooth right now. We\u2019ve been hearing of some creeping supply shortages. Are you seeing any supply issues as stereo Bluetooth gets more popular as a category? Joe Burton : The good news on stereo Bluetooth so far is we do have a very nice line of products and some nice growth predicted there. So far, our growth is very much in line with our internal expectations and therefore we have our supply chain sorted out accordingly. Pam Strayer : Tavis, I missed the beginning of your question. Joe Burton : Can you repeat the second one on\u2026 Tavis McCourt : Yes. So, I think if my model\u2019s correct, Americas ex-U.S. had a reasonably strong quarter this quarter, especially year-over-year. Is there any specific going on, over $2 million ahead of what it typically has been? Pam Strayer : Yes. We had a strong quarter there this quarter. We\u2019ve got some new agreements, channel agreements going on down there that\u2019s really helping improve our business; it\u2019s strong on the enterprise side. So, that\u2019s good news for us. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Greg Burns from Sidoti & Company. Your line is open. Greg Burns : Good afternoon. I just wanted to follow-up on the Core Enterprise market may be your hardware service initiative. Do you think that might help alleviate some of the softness you\u2019re seeing in that market? Is that something you\u2019re moving forward with to address the shift of the core business? And just maybe more generally how that internal initiative move in that direction in development? Joe Burton : Right. Yes, when you talked about our hardware as a service or as we internally refer to it, device as a service, this is an initiative we\u2019ve put together over the last year or so, very much in order to make sure that we can align with the way people want to buy. There are certainly plenty of customers that are still buying their unified communications, their contact center as a capital system that they put on premise. When customers do that, they tend to buy their headsets as well.  We are seeing that in the shift to the cloud that we mentioned in our prepared remakes where people in some cases are now consuming this in utility model where they\u2019re paying monthly or yearly, there are indeed customers that are asking about being able to have the hardware component of that sale, headsets very much on the same type of billing model, by the month, by the year on a term contract. We put our device as a service together to be able to align with those customers and make it easier to do business with us. It\u2019s still early days, we\u2019ve customers that are using it, we\u2019re shaken out the system, and certainly over time and as the service model would indeed provide a more consistent revenue flow for the customers that are doing it. But it\u2019s still early days and it\u2019s not a material part of our revenues at this point. Greg Burns : Then on the consumer business, it\u2019s down a little bit more sequentially than I was looking for. Was that a function of there being a sell in, in the first quarter with -- amongst new products you brought to market? And then what does the roadmap look like in future quarters; [ph] do you have handful of new products come out in the back half of the year? Joe Burton : For the most part, the sequentially down quarter-over-quarter that you\u2019re talking about in Consumer, you understood correctly, Greg. It is much more about a very nice sell-in in the previous quarter related to some new product launches the 5200 and some others. It\u2019s not about any weakness in the business. Consumer has actually been quite strong. And we\u2019re predicting it to be strong for the foreseeable future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave King from Roth Capital Partners. Your line is open. Dave King : Forgive me, if you already answered some of this because I had to jump on late. But, I guess first off on the guidance, can you talk a bit about how you\u2019re thinking about that shaping up sort of by category, UC versus Core Enterprise versus some of the Consumer and any help may be on mono versus stereo there? And then similarly, what sort of -- obviously we can make our assumptions around what sort of impact that will be to gross margin by mix but as I think about the operating margin and guidance, what does that sort of assume in terms of changes in SG&A versus sort of gross margin? Pam Strayer : Okay, there is a lot in there. So, let me try and take those down one by one. So first of all on guidance for the revenue line. We always assume some puts and takes but generally I would say that the revenue guidance is going to shape up with year-over-year growth rate. So, it\u2019s similar to what we saw this quarter. We expect the strong UC growth quarter, we expect the strong Consumer growth quarter with Core Enterprise being flat, maybe down slightly, maybe up slightly, it\u2019s hard to know. On the Consumer side, that growth there we\u2019re expecting yet again strong stereo quarter contributing to Consumer growth. Mono, it\u2019s kind of anybody\u2019s guess, but we\u2019re forecasting that to be somewhat flat to be down slightly, could be up slightly. So that\u2019s the revenue line. You asked about operating margin. Dave King : Sure, yes, operating margin, SG&A versus kind of gross profit? Pam Strayer : So, the operating margin itself, we are forecasting for that to go down a bit quarter-over-quarter as is typical Q3 is a heavy consumer quarter. And our gross margin is expected to go down a little bit because of the product mix shift next quarter. So that gross margin slight decline will fall to those bottom line and our operating margin will come down a little bit. But again, it\u2019s seasonal; it\u2019s Q3. We expect that to bounce back again in Q4. On the SG&A and OpEx lines, we\u2019re expecting it flat to a little bit up quarter-over-quarter. Dave King : Okay. That\u2019s good color, Pam. And then, maybe just one more, switching gears, and Joe, maybe just thinking longer term and understanding that some of the new SaaS offering is still nascent and small contributor to revenue. But, as I think about it, in sounds like it\u2019s going to be fairly high ROI and high margin. I guess what are you sort of thinking longer term in terms of as that shifts, I guess as the way I\u2019m thinking about it, not being necessarily a software analyst. But as I think about that, I would think that would boost your margins, but maybe there is a negative revenue impact. How should we be thinking about that shift over time? Do you still get that related sell-in from a revenue perspective, or there something we need to be -- I\u2019m missing or we need to be thinking about? Thanks. Joe Burton : Once again, early days, but to take the Software as a Service data insights apart a little bit. Our Software as a Service is a set of data insights that allow customers to manage their UC deployment and actually run their business more efficiently. This is an adder that lays over top of the headset businesses. So, you saw the headsets just like before, it doesn\u2019t shift the revenues in or out, doesn\u2019t drive them down, doesn\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s an additional software layer that provides additional value on top. Yes, because it\u2019s Software as a Service, it tends to be attractive margins. It\u2019s very small numbers right now. Certainly over time that would have a positive effect on the overall blend. Does that answer the question? Dave King : Absolutely, it\u2019s perfect. Thank you. And good luck with the rest of the year. Thank you. Joe Burton : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the presenters. Greg Klaben : Thank you very much everyone for joining us today. We\u2019re available afterwards, if you have any other follow-on questions. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is DeShawn, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Plantronics Q3 Fiscal Year 2017 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Will Zelver, Senior Analyst, Investor Relations. The floor is yours. Will Zelver : Thanks, DeShawn. I will be filling in for Greg Klaben, our Vice President of Investor Relations, who unfortunately is out sick today. Joining me are Joe Burton, Plantronics' President and CEO; and Pam Strayer, Plantronics' Senior Vice President and CFO. The information presented and discussed today includes forward-looking statements, which are made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The risks and uncertainties related to such statements are detailed in our most recent 10-Q, 10-K, and today's press release. A complete set of prepared remarks of today's conference call are available on the Investor Relations section of our Web site. For the remainder of today's call, we will be providing only non-GAAP metrics related to gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, and earnings per share. We have reconciled these measures in our earnings press release and our quarterly analyst metric sheet, both of which are available on the Investor Relations page of our Web site. After the conclusion of today's call, the recording of the call will be available with information on our Web site. Plantronics' third quarter fiscal year 2017 net revenues were $232.9 million. Plantronics' GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter were $0.68 compared with $0.49 in the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter were $0.79 compared with $0.83 in the prior year. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 consists of charges for stock-based compensation, restructuring, and purchase accounting amortization, all net of the associated tax impacts, tax benefits from the release of tax reserves. Please refer to the full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in our earnings release. With that, I will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Burns from Sidoti & Company. Your line is open. Greg Burns : Good afternoon. Just a question in regards to the gross margins on the consumer side of the business, could you just talk about some of the levers you have there to improve the gross margins of that business over the next 12 months? Pam Strayer : Hi, Greg, this is Pam. Yes, I can talk about that a little bit. Consumer is going to be a focus of ours, and the profitability of consumer is going to be a focus of ours over the coming quarters. There are things that we can do there. We're going to be looking at our go-to-market channels and our product list. We're going to be focused on areas where we have higher margins. Now the depth [ph] of our stereo and console gaming products are doing well. We are gaining scale there, which means we're going to be able to get more volume discounts with our suppliers. So we will be doing a thorough review there and looking for ways to trim some of the lower margin channels and products. Greg Burns : Okay. And in terms of the Manager Pro service platform, could you give us an idea of what the average ASP is, or what a customer is -- average customer generates per month for that type of service, and how is that platform kind of changing the conversations with your customers? I know you already have very high market share, but is this a true differentiator where you think you could gain additional market share? Joe Burton : Yes. Hey there, Greg, Joe Burton jumping in on that one. To the first part of it, we are still in the very, very early days with Plantronics' Manager Pro. We are having a tremendous reception in the market. However, I think we've said we're really going to talk about selling price and how to think about that at our next call, if I understand that correctly. Pam, yes. Pam Strayer : Yes. At our Q4 call we typically do an update of our long-term market model expectations, and we didn't do anything on staff last year when we did our market model. So, we will be updating that in May [ph]. Joe Burton : Absolutely. However, on the second part of the question, how is it changing the conversation with people? I have to say we are absolutely trilled with that. When we go in and talk to people, I think we have always been known as obviously a premier provider of high-quality, precision audio products, primarily headsets. When we bring in the SaaS product, we are actually adding in a conversation, where we can really give people insight into their business, not only to the headsets, but how the unified communication system is sounding and running; insights into how the system is actually being used. We talk very much about our innovation ways. We've talked about before taming chaos, keeping people in the zone, smarter customer interactions. When we talk about that and we show people that Manager Pro coupled with our headsets are helping them tame that IT chaos, giving them better insights into the business, changing the conversations that they are having with their customers. It really does give us we think a unique conversation that's resonating very, very well with our customers. I won't speak to what we think that will do around share, it's still the early days, but it's a very welcome conversation that our customers are really embracing. Greg Burns : Okay, thanks. And lastly, if there's some kind of border tax implemented how would that affect your operations, particularly in Mexico, and do you have ways to address that? Joe Burton : Yes. On that in general you might imagine that that's something we are keeping eye on just like everybody else. Given that there are no actual proposals out there yet, it is simply too early to say. You might imagine going through a variety of scenario plans, as a company we think we can do what's needed to keep our business strong, but we are simply not going to comment on the exact -- on exactly what it's going to be, since we don't know what it's going to be. It's just too early. As we get more details, we'll continue tuning our plans, but we are very confident we can react to whatever comes out. Greg Burns : Okay, thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Dave King with ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is open. Dave King : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess first off, maybe following up a little bit on the gross margin question, and then just thinking about the 20% operating margin target that you've got for fiscal '18. I guess is that, the gross margin improvement within consumer is that sort of the primary driver of getting operating margins there, or are there other things that you can point to? And then I guess, just as we think about that 20% target, you know, what's assumed in that both from an FX perspective and then consumer as a percentage of the overall portfolio. I guess what are some of the puts and takes there? Thank you. Pam Strayer : Sure. So, in terms of a 20% operating margin, increasing our consumer profitability will be part of that, part of that will be continuing to work on material cost savings for the enterprise business, on a [ph] continual basis. It also includes some strong OpEx discipline, while at the same time finding ways to invest in long-term growth opportunities. So we're trying to get all these pieces to fit, and we think we can do that next year. The assumptions built-in around FX are that there's not going to be significant movement -- negative movements in the currency, if it does move heavy towards a negative again that will be a challenge for us. Of course we have a hedge program and that tends to delay the impact. So we think FY'18 right now we've got some hedge gains that are going to offset some of the latest movements in currency. So, those are some of the assumptions that we're using. We're not giving any FY'18 guidance right now, we'll do that in the next quarter and earnings call. Dave King : Understood. Joe Burton : Pam, the one thing I'd add on there is certainly as we've worked with the team over the last several quarters and now we're just absolutely thrilled with what we're seeing around the reception to the new products, the critical mass that we're getting in the field, the ability to continue optimizing some of our processes and working on the economies of scale that we can get that Pam mentioned earlier. Assuming things are relatively the same on the macroeconomic level to what they are right now, we felt good putting that out there. We think it's a great business right now, and very achievable. Dave King : Okay, that's great color, both Joe and Pam there. And then maybe switching gears a little bit, the strength in UC this quarter, can you talk about what might have driven the acceleration there if there's anything to point to? And then is there anything to worry about in terms of potential disruptions from the recent bankruptcy of one of your UC partners? I would assume there is nothing to worry about in terms of inventory or credit risk, what have you, but anything in terms of disruptions to revenue, how should we be thinking about that? Thank you. Joe Burton : Yes, this is Joe. I'll start out; also if Pam has anything she can add on, but I'll take the Avaya piece first. Currently, any amounts that are due to us or that we owe to Avaya are not material. There's just nothing there that's material. We'll continue to monitor what's going on with Avaya's process in the bankruptcy proceedings, but we believe that the market they serve is still robust, both they and other vendors will continue selling, and even existing Avaya customers still have a strong need for both new and replacement headsets and we just don't see that as a big, big change to us. On UC, and really what's driving the relative strength that we've seen, there's a few things there; the UC growth has been driven very much by new product launches on our side, notably our Voyager Focus and the UC variant of the Voyager 5200. Voyager 5200 you might think of as an updated and enhanced version of our Voyager Legend product if you haven't experienced it yet. Also, our Blackwire family is up significantly in recent quarters, and we think this is really driven by an increase in large deals. Dave King : Okay, that's great color all around. Pam Strayer : I would just add one additional thing, Dave, on UC growth simply that our market model expectations were that UC would be up five-year CAGR of around 13%. We were seeing some lower growth rates in past quarters, so I think this is returning closer to the growth that we expected. Joe Burton : Yes. Dave King : Great point. Great, thanks for the color, and I'll step back, and good luck with the rest of the year. Joe Burton : Thanks, Dave. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Paul Coster : Yes, thank you for taking the question. You've sort of proposed the potential CAGR of; I think it was about 6% to 8% over the next couple of years. And it looks like you're looking for about 10% growth in the Consumer segment. Now the Consumer segment has put up double-digit growth for calendar year here, but it was lapping easy comps as the Mono business kind of faded. What gives you the confidence you can continue at 10% [indiscernible] in this segment? Joe Burton : Hi, Paul, this is Joe. A couple of pieces on that, first of all, as you say, we're doing rather well in the mono arena although that is a flat-to-down market. On the stereo side, so stereo consumer, stereo Bluetooth in particular, and I'll come to gaming as well, but in the stereo we're obviously seeing a market that is growing adequately. So the stereo Bluetooth market I think we saw tremendous gains in the entire category last year. Now we're not performing quite at the level of the entire category, but that's on purpose. We're picking the areas of consumer stereo Bluetooth where we think we can be profitable, where we think performance audio matters. Nevertheless, we think that we can grow the stereo portion of the business, the gaming portion of the business considerably higher to offset any declines on the mono side. So we feel good about being in that growth rate over the next year. Paul Coster : And your brand, how are you positioning the brand amongst what's probably a slightly more useful demographic there? Joe Burton : So from a brand positioning I actually think we've been doing a lot of very nice work. Obviously a lot of our marketing has been updated substantially. We're doing an incredible amount of work with social marketing as well. Generally speaking though we're still positioning our brand, it's youthful, the designs are updated, the colors are updated, but we're still targeting people where performance matters. So we're after the active fitness segment where we're after athletes that want a product that really won't let them down, we're after gaming segments where performance matters in competitive gaming. We're after mobile communications and business travelers where performance audio really matters. And as we're targeting the brand in that direction we've actually seen a very, very good response, as you can see with this quarter's numbers. And we expect that to broadly continue on the Consumer side. Paul Coster : All right. So when the Consumer side and the Enterprise side are both working there's not much urgency in the question of synergies between the two, but perhaps you can just remind us what are the synergies between the two and the strategic importance of them on a relative basis? Joe Burton : Yes, so there's a couple of pieces to that, Paul. So first of all on the synergies side. Making a fantastic high-performance headset has a lot of proprietary expertise, we see that. There's a lot of cheap headsets out there that don't do so well. But when we actually talk about Plantronics' unique differentiators when we look at 50 years of acoustics background, 50 years of human factors for wearable technology, very small radios with batteries that last all-day long, those are clearly those areas of expertise are synergies that get applied equally to both markets. So the things you have to know to be great in consumer you have to know to be great in enterprise, and vice-versa. Now the other part of course is having the strong, broad consumer brand that is high volume also helps our brand on the enterprise side, so it helps make people know who we are, helps them understand what Plantronics is when they get to work. And the last and most crucial part of this in our mind is, in a world that is less locked down from IT than in the old days BYOD or bring your own device becomes increasingly important. You do have people bringing their laptop, their cell phone, and their headset from home to the office. Plantronics can provide a device where they can pick it up through a retail channel, and when they get to work IT is not going to be too upset because they know the brand and they know it will perform. Paul Coster : Very good, thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mike Koban with Raymond James. Your line is open. Mike Koban : Hi everyone. Thanks for taking my question. This is Mike Koban on for Tavis McCourt. Actually, a bunch of my questions have been answered. I just kind of had a couple of housekeeping items left. What are you guys expecting your tax rates to be for FY'17 and FY'18? Pam Strayer : For FY'17 the tax rate is 25%. We're not giving out FY'18 guidance, the budget isn't finalized. But I think historically we've always kind of been in the 25% to 26.5% range. Mike Koban : Okay, great, thanks. And as far as the expenses related to the lawsuit, can you give us any update on where those sit right now and what you think they might be going forward? Pam Strayer : Yes. So [indiscernible] ongoing legal fees are typically around $1 million to $2 million a quarter. In Q3 they were right around the $2 million mark, and that's what we expect for the most part going forward. Joe Burton : Generally speaking, that's the level we expect until the conclusion of the matter. Mike Koban : Great. And then as far as your consumer segment, can you just give us your best estimate of what the mono -- what percent of that is made up by the mono products -- mono Bluetooth products? Joe Burton : What percent of the entire consumer revenues are mono? Mike Koban : Correct, yes. Pam Strayer : I got that here, just one minute. So, on the mono side it's roughly a little under 50% of our overall consumer. But I'm sure you know that that's varied over time as the mono category has dropped off and consumer or stereo have gained some growth. But mono still is our largest category in the consumer space. Mike Koban : Got you, great. And my last question is just around the enterprise segments. It's been roughly flat for a couple of years even though UC has been showing some pretty good growth. What gives you confidence that this should improve, and is there some levers and ASPs you can pull or anything like that? Pam Strayer : Well, we look at our core enterprise revenues and track those carefully. We've gone back and looked at trends over time. It is generally been a flat market. The units have been very consistent over time. And so what we're seeing is variation around the mean. We tend to be kind of on the low end right now, but we do expect that to come back. I think it's been exaggerated by the fact that we've had a strong dollar. So that's also hurting us on the revenue growth side. Joe Burton : Yes, I think that's a lot of it, Pam. Really well done. Frankly speaking, as we're out there talking to our business partners across the world and our customers from a unit volume perspective we still see this as a flat to slightly up market in the core with substantial upside in UC. As Pam said, we get little fluctuations around dollar or lumpy big deals that cause it to move. But we're still very confident of what we're seeing; the best days are still in front of us in that business. Mike Koban : Great, thanks guys. That's all for me. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mike Latimore with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open. Nick Altmann : Yes, hi guys. This is Nick Altmann filling in for Mike. Thanks for taking my questions. Just looking into next quarter, how should we be thinking about the mix between office and consumer revenue? Pam Strayer : Yes. So, the mix in Q4 is going to shift back with less consumer revenue compared to Q3 as you know that's sort of high consumer quarter for us, because of the holiday period of time. I think we hit a high in Q3 of consumer on 32% of total revenues, and which I would expect that to go back down to 30%, which is more in line with where we've been historically outside of the Q3. Nick Altmann : Okay, thanks. And then, can you guys just talking about are there any industry verticals that are performing better or worse than others? Joe Burton : I don't know that we're seeing any material shifts in vertical-to-vertical. I think we are seeing reasonable strength across all of them, no particular weakness; I know we've had some weakness here and there in the past, but in particular ones, but no, right now I think it was fairly broad across the board. One piece that we've been asked about a couple of times is in the past we occasionally have seen -- we have occasionally seen issues where the energy sector will bounce up and down, the financial sector will bounce up and down, although seem to be very normal at the moment. Nick Altmann : Got it, got it. Okay, and then last one; are you guys seeing any areas of regional strength or weakness? And then if you could specifically touch on Europe, that would be great. Pam Strayer : So, I think by region, our results have been fairly consistent with some real strong growth, and you see really nice consumer growth year-over-year. Those have been consistent themes across all the regions. For Europe in particular, I would say maybe the unusual thing that stands out there is the U.K. and Ireland is our largest region over there and that's been a little bit weak over the past couple of quarters. I think we said last time, we pointed that out also, and it's probably a result of Brexit and uncertainty happening in that region. Joe Burton : Yes, maybe a little weak, but nothing outrageous either, it's just something we are keeping an eye on. Nick Altmann : Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Bill Baker with GARP Research. Your line is open. Bill Baker : Yes, thanks. Do you see any changes coming from Microsoft or Vantage [ph] or people like that who might be having some impact on the adoption of UC? Joe Burton : Yes, couple of pieces there; and thanks for the question. First of all, generally speaking, I mean we do UC hitting its stride. The big UC vendors -- and it will always be a little lumpy as deals come in, but the big UC vendors be it Cisco, Microsoft, Avaya, to some extent and others continue to do well. Also though we see -- let's might turn it up for a minute; as we see the cloud versions of the UC things beginning to take off soon, particular Cisco's, Microsoft's and some of the born-in-the-cloud UC solutions, we are seeing that begin to help UC pick up a little bit of steam. Bill Baker : Okay. Joe Burton : Are there any further questions on the line, Bill? Bill Baker : No, no. I'm sorry. Joe Burton : Oh. Thanks, Bill. Bill Baker : Sorry. Joe Burton : That's cool. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And I currently see no questions over the phone. I will turn the call back over to the presenters. Will Zelver : Thanks, everyone. Thanks for joining the call, and if you need to get in contact with us, please call the Plantronics' mainline at 800 -- excuse me, I don't have it in front of me. You know, yes, 800-544-4660 and ask for Will Zelver. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. It was great to see so many of you at our recent Security Analyst Meeting here in Palo Alto. Our results today echo what you heard from us, HP is strong and getting stronger. And my message to all of you is we\u2019re just getting started. As I look at our performance in the quarter and for the full fiscal year, I\u2019m pleased with our consistent execution, ability to grow revenue, generate cash flow, and invest in our future to create sustainable growth over time. It\u2019s results like these that give us confidence in the trajectory of our business moving forward. It was just two years ago that we began our reinvention journey. We committed to compete and win in our core, into new growth markets and natural adjacencies, and invest in our future where we can disrupt industries and create new categories. We\u2019re also committed to a relentless focus on productivity, to take cost out of the business. We did what we said we\u2019d do, and I\u2019m proud of the substantial progress we have made. There is more work to do, but we\u2019ve never been more competitive, more fixated on the customer, more innovative, and more focused on operational excellence than we\u2019re today. Let me review the highlights. We drove impressive topline growth with net revenue up 11% year-over-year to $13.9 billion including double-digit growth and share gains across the Americas, EMEA, and APJ. Both, Personal Systems and Printing grew year-over-year, together for the third consecutive quarter. We grew non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share year-over-year, delivering $0.44 for the quarter. We delivered $0.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, taking us to $3.3 billion for the full year. And we returned 69% of our FY17 free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, let me turn to segment performance. In quarter four, Personal Systems had another stellar quarter, driving growth, gaining profitable share, and delivering impressive innovations. This team is hitting their stride with truly outstanding performance. Personal Systems net revenue grew 13% year-over-year, which came on top of last year\u2019s 4% growth in quarter four. For the full year we grew 11% year-over-year with double-digit growth in each of the past four quarters. Growth in Personal Systems continued to be broad-based with double-digit year-over-year revenue gains in consumer and commercial and across all three regions. We also saw consistent growth across product categories led by notebooks, and strong performance in desktops and workstations. Our regional leaders and sales partners are doing an incredible job of driving growth and delivering value for our customers. In calendar quarter three, the overall PC market returned to year-over-year growth both in units and revenue. We once again outperformed the PC unit market growth and increased our market share to 22.5%, up 1.2 points year-over-year. We saw year-over-year share gains continuing in each region in both consumer and commercial. In quarter four, we continue to surprise and delight the market with innovation. We announced our biggest premium launch across consumer and commercial, introduced the world\u2019s most powerful and first detachable PC workstation, unleashed our most powerful OMEN X laptop for gaming athletes. And as you heard from us at SAM, we are doubling down on security with the world\u2019s most secure and manageable commercial PCs. Security is built into our systems from the BIOS level and up, securing at, below, and above the operating system. As customer demands to services grows and the market transitions towards an on-demand based economy, we are gaining steady traction with enhanced devices or service offerings for the fleet management. We are seeing strong wins by our channel partners and a healthy pipeline for the future. Shifting to Printing. This business continues to make significant progress with year-over-year growth in revenue, operating profit and market share. In quarter four, total revenue was up 7% year-over-year with growth across all three geographic regions. We delivered year-over-year revenue increases in consumer hardware, commercial hardware and supplies. Quarter four supplies revenue grew again, demonstrating the huge progress we\u2019ve made with this business during the year. Hardware units grew both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by consumer. This is our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year unit growth. Total print unit market share was 40% in calendar quarter three, and we gained share in both our office and home businesses. The graphics business continues to grow, even without the positive uplift that we experienced last year from the industry-wide drupa event. And as highlighted at the Security Analyst Meeting, we signed the single largest deal in our graphics history with Lightning Source. It\u2019s a multimillion dollar, multiyear deal to deploy 24 PageWide digital presses to five printing sites on three continents. Lightning Source prints roughly 40% of the books sold through Amazon and this deal is going to help transform the distribution and sales model for book publishers all over the world. In A3, we continued to onboard new partners and gain market share, both year-over-year and sequentially. And I\u2019m excited that on November the 1st, we closed the acquisition of Samsung\u2019s Printing business. This creates a combined team, focused on innovation, acceleration and print excellence. Together, we are building on more than 30 years of print leadership and innovation, and now we have an unmatched portfolio and amazing technologies that will enable us to drive growth over time. As our two teams become one, we will preserve the best, the best talent, the best culture and the best technology to become better, stronger and faster. We\u2019ve gained critical IP and now have a broad portfolio of laser and ink offerings that better positions us to attack the overall $55 billion A3 growth opportunity. And that also strengthens our A4 business. 2017 was a great year for 3D. We turned out 3D printing initiative into a business with global reach, repeat customer orders and expanding partner and materials ecosystem and revenue. This quarter, we continued to grow our business with new customers such as Medtronic, one of the largest medical device and service companies in the world. As previously highlighted, we As previously highlighted, we added more than 20 new partners including Henkel, our first worldwide reseller, and announced partnerships with Deloitte and Siemens to digitally transform manufacturing. Looking to 2018, we plan to introduce a new, lower cost full color system, allowing us to expand into new markets. We believe that Multi Jet Fusion will be the only 3D printing technology in the industry that can make mechanically robust, fully functional, color parts. Not only, are we leaders in polymers but we\u2019re going to disrupt 3D printing with metals. Stay tuned for more news about this in the coming year. Overall, we\u2019ve done what we said we would do. We\u2019re growing the business, top line and bottom line, and generating strong cash flow. We\u2019re delivering returns for our shareholders and investing in the future to create long-term value. I\u2019m very pleased with our Q4 and FY17 results, but we always have more work to do for our customers, partners, employees and investors. Our markets remain highly competitive and our year-over-year compares are now much tougher, but we\u2019re ready for it. I\u2019m optimistic about our future and excited that we\u2019re just getting started. I will now turn the call over to Cathie to provide more details on our performance and our financial outlook. Cathie Lesjak : Thanks, Dion. I\u2019m very pleased that we have sustained the momentum achieved during our first three quarters of FY17 and drove strong Q4 results. We delivered net revenue of $13.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year, as reported or 12% in constant currency. Our performance remained consistent across businesses and geographies. Regionally, year-over-year, Americas grew 10%, EMEA was up 11%, and APJ grew 16%, all in constant currency. Gross margin of 18.1% was down 20 basis points year-over-year, driven by segment mix with the higher commodity costs in Personal Systems partially being offset by the improved rate in Printing. Gross margins were down 50 basis points sequentially, driven by continued strength of Personal Systems revenue, combined with lower supplies mix and higher unit growth in Printing. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.5 billion were up 6% year-over-year and sequentially, driven by SG&A investments to support growth. Net OI&E expense was $65 million for the quarter. With a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes restructuring and other charges of $113 million and acquisition-related charges of $49 million, partially offset by non-operating retirement-related credits of $34 million, tax indemnification credits of $23 million and the related tax impact on these charges. In Q4, GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.39. Turning to the segments. Personal Systems net revenue was $9.1 billion, up 13% year-over-year as reported or 14% in constant currency. We\u2019ve been delivering strong topline performance and are now beginning to lap tougher compares. By customer segment, consumer revenue was up 18% and commercial revenue was up 11% year-over-year. We again achieved strong results by product category, with notebooks up 16%, desktops up 10% and workstations up 8% year-over-year. This consistent performance is a result of our innovative product portfolio and effective execution. We delivered 3.8% operating margin in the quarter, which is up 10 basis points sequentially and down 50 basis points year-over-year. As we have highlighted throughout this fiscal year, margins have been pressured by industry-wide increases in component costs. We have increased prices globally, continued to leverage our supply chain scale and balance sheet, and have driven positive mix shifts in the business, enabling us to offset much of the commodity cost increases. Turning to Printing. Revenue was $4.9 billion in the quarter, up 7% year-over-year. Total hardware units were up 3% year-over-year, with consumer units up 3% and commercial units flat. In calendar Q3, overall print unit share was up about a point year-over-year with share gains in both our home and office businesses. Now moving to Q3 supplies performance. Revenue of $3.1 billion was up 10% year-over-year or up 3% after adjusting for currency and last year\u2019s negative impact resulting from the supplies sales model change. We continue to operate below our channel inventory ceilings. We are also making good progress with our growth initiatives. We are still in the early days of A3 and adding Samsung\u2019s printing team and technology should be a further accelerator to the business over time. As Dion highlighted, the graphics business continued to grow and we look forward to entering into textiles [ph] later this year. It was also a very strong quarter for managed print services with high double digit new TCB growth. Managed print services results can be heavily impacted by large deals signed in a quarter. And this was the case for us in Q4 which was driven by key wins. Print operating profit was 16.6% in the quarter, up 2.6 points year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the lower margins in Q4 2016 resulting from the supply sales model change. Excluding this onetime adjustment, we still saw good operating profit dollar expansion year-over-year. Sequentially, print operating margins were down 70 basis points, driven by materially higher than normal unit shipments, especially in consumer. The overall supplies revenue mix for the quarter was 64% versus 66% in Q3. Now, turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was $680 million in Q4 and approximately $3.7 billion for the full year. Free cash flow was $515 million in the quarter and approximately $3.3 billion fiscal 2017. Cash conversion cycle was minus 30 days, which weakened five days sequentially, driven by a three-day decrease in days payable outstanding, and a two -ay increase in days of inventory. Our cash conversion cycle and free cash flow results were better than expected for the quarter, driven by continued strength in Personal Systems revenue. During Q4, we had a total capital return of $722 million through share re-purchases and cash dividends. For the full year, we returned $2.3 billion or 59% of free cash flow, which is towards the higher end of our target range of 50% to 75%, even after overachieving our full year free cash flow guidance provided at our 2016 SAM. Looking forward, keep the following in mind related to our financial outlook. Starting with Samsung\u2019s printing business, we are updating our full year FY 2018 outlook to include the operational impact of the acquisition. This includes approximately $1.4 billion incremental revenue, primarily A4, which has been in decline, particularly in the low-end; an additional penny of non-GAAP EPS for the full year. And as a reminder, we expect to be in investment mode in the first half of the year. Looking ahead, we expect to record various business combination accounting adjustments, which are not yet reflected in our outlook, since the acquisition just closed. These are noncash and GAAP-only costs and include adjustments to the fair value of certain acquired assets such as purchase intangibles and inventory. In addition, we will continue to look at opportunities to take costs out of the business, now that the deal has closed. For the rest of Printing, we expect supplies revenue to be flat to slightly up for the full year. This is organic growth and excludes any impact from the acquisition of Samsung\u2019s printing business. In addition, we expect to continue placing units with a positive NPV. In Personal Systems, we now expect the cost of components will continue to increase from Q4 into Q1 and will remain elevated throughout FY18. We anticipate that ASPs may be pressured due to competitive repricing effectively offsetting a sizeable portion of any gross currency tailwind, but this will depend on the actual market dynamics including component costs, competition and currency rates. Overall, we would expect more of the FX favorability to show up during the second half of the year as prior hedges roll off. For the full year, we expect to deliver our productivity initiatives as guided at SAM. We\u2019ll also continue to leverage our balance sheet, if we see attractive economic opportunities to do so. With all that in mind, we expect free cash flow to be at least $3 billion for the full year and our cash conversion cycle to be approximately minus 29 days as we exit FY18. Q1 2018 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.40 to $0.43. Q1 2018 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.38 to $0.42. With the $0.01 increase in EPS from our acquisition of Samsung\u2019s printing business, we\u2019re raising our full year fiscal 2018 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share by a $0.01 to be in a range of a $1.75 to $1.85, and our full year fiscal 2018 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of a $1.70 to a $1.80. With that, let\u2019s go eat some turkey, or we can open up the call for questions. Operator : We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you. And congratulations to you and your team, as well as a happy early Thanksgiving. I have two questions, I\u2019ll ask them at the same time. Perhaps the first one is to Dion or Cathie, and the second one more towards Cathie. Regarding the -- Dion, the sales upside was -- looks like across basically almost every line and every end-market, which is great but the drop here to EPS at the bottom, I guess some investors could have wanted or hoped for more. Are you spending a little more for like investing in the business, in the channel and products and R&D? And if so, what are the specific areas as to where you\u2019re investing or not seeing the drop through? And then, the follow-up is on the Samsung acquisition, a $0.01 of earnings. I assume that it\u2019s first half of the year more of a headwind as you integrate and the accretion comes in at the tail end and then longer term, it should be much more than a $0.01 of annual EPS? Cathie Lesjak : So, Jim, let me start with the first one in terms of your comment around the drop. I think, the way we think about this is if you go back to kind of the Q3 earnings call, we provided an EPS range, and we ended up at the higher end of that range. So, we anticipated kind of where we thought we would end up. Now, we did see a little bit of upside from a Personal Systems perspective, and that drove a lot of the top line, and there just isn\u2019t as much drop in Personal Systems, especially when you combine that with commodity cost headwinds that we\u2019ve seen in that business. And then, on top of that in print, what we were really focused on this quarter was not only keeping supplies stabilized, which we did, very pleased with the results there, but we also took advantage of a little bit bigger market and also the opportunity to place materially more printer units than what we would normally see on a sequential basis. And so that obviously put some downward pressure on operating profit and EPS as well. Operator : The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Cathie Lesjak : Operator, can you hold on just one sec? I think there was another question specifically related to Samsung, Jim, if I remember correctly. And basically we\u2019ve obviously just closed the acquisition at the beginning of November. And for FY18, we do expect to see about a $0.01 of accretion but it is more backend loaded. So, for the whole year, it would be about a $0.01, but we do expect to be in investment mode in the first half of 2018. And then, over time, the pressure that we see on the math around the OP rate as a result of the acquisition of the Samsung printing business, we do expect that as we integrate that business and take advantage of the disruption, the disruptive technology they have in the A3 copier space that in fact the margins will recover. Okay. Operator, next question? Operator : The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Couple of follow-ups on the printer business. If I heard you right, organically printer supplies grew 3% in the quarter, you\u2019re guiding for flat to slightly up next year. So, can you talk about the elements in the four-box model that suggests a little bit of a deceleration as you got into next year? And then, just a follow-up on printer margins, they came in below the 17%ish that you were at the last few quarters. Can you just walk through some of those factors? And as you bake in some of the new categories you\u2019re entering as well as Samsung, where do you think the near to medium-term range for printer margins will be? Thank you. Cathie Lesjak : So, let me start with the supplies question. Katy, thanks for that question. We have really proven to ourselves and hopefully to you that you should have confidence in our four-box model. We saw that we performed at least as well as we had expected and in some cases a bit better than what we had expected, both for the full year 2017 quarter by quarter as well as in Q4. And based on that, we grew supplies, obviously in Q3 and Q4 operationally, and we\u2019ve plugged that into the model. And what we see coming out of the model is that supplies for FY18 would be flat to slightly up. But keep in mind, we are always working on ways to optimize kind of each of the boxes with a variety of strategies and tactics, and we will continue to do that and try to drive even better supplies performance. Dion Weisler : Second question was around margins over time. Cathie Lesjak : And in terms of print margins over time, what we talked about at the Security Analyst Meeting, and this is without Samsung, was that over the long term, we would expect that the print margins would be in the 16% to 18% range. In the shorter term with Samsung, there will be pressure on the rate. I mean, think about that we brought Samsung in at about a $1.4 billion in revenue for FY18 and about a $0.01 of net profit to the Company. And in near to short-term, the next half, we expect it to be in investment mode. So, there will be incremental pressure. But, we do think over time that those margins get back to the 16% to 18% range. Dion Weisler : And Katy just to reiterate the point that Cathie made to Jim\u2019s question, the rate was slightly down this quarter but we did place sequentially many more units than we ordinarily would. And of course that bring the razorblade business model, generates returns over time, positive NPV units and a good deal for our investors. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead. Steve Milunovich : Following up on that, you did put more units out there, but the growth at least was higher on consumer than in commercial. And generally, the commercial units, I would think would have a greater attach rate. So, I guess what\u2019s your confidence that those are in fact going to be NPV positive if it\u2019s skewed a bit more toward consumer? Cathie Lesjak : So, Steve, we have a lot of confidence. Our consumer portfolio, particularly in the inkjet space, those printers phone [ph] home regularly and they let us know where and what types of printers are getting really strong attach rate. You\u2019re absolutely right, most of the incremental units were in the consumer space because that\u2019s where we saw both a little bit better market sizing and then also on an opportunity to place positive NPV units. Steve Milunovich : Okay. And then, should we look for a little bit of growth for the printer business next year? It sounds like graphics probably grows, supplies flat to up; I don\u2019t know what hardware does, but you put all together. I assume, it\u2019s a little bit of growth. And if we\u2019re sitting here a year from now, what are your priorities, what are you hoping to achieve and how do we -- this last year was all about stabilizing supplies, what are we looking for to accomplish in the next 12 months? Cathie Lesjak : I think Enrique said it best at the Security Analyst Meeting. We\u2019re really focused on accelerating growth. We don\u2019t guide revenue. But if you do the math, if you\u2019ve done the math, you can imagine. I mean, if supplies is, 60 plus, 65% plus of the revenue and it\u2019s flat to slightly up, and we\u2019ve got growth initiatives across the A3 copier space, where we think there is real opportunities, we\u2019ve got the 3D printing opportunity to grow, we think that we\u2019re actually as Dion say, just getting started in that space. Dion Weisler : I think it\u2019s always important to remember, Steve, we\u2019re executing across our entire strategy, which is to cross three pillars of our core business. It generates the vast majority of our revenue and operating profit today. The growth initiatives around A3, our graphics business, everything is a service which will obviously provide growth opportunities for us over the next two to three years and then further out into the future over the next five to ten years, the work we\u2019re doing around the most of computing and 3D printing, really crates an opportunity for long-term growth for our shareholders. Operator : The next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sherri Scribner : I want to ask a question on the PC business as we move forward into fiscal 2018. I think Cathie, you mentioned the compare is much more difficult in fiscal 2018. I think the bearish view is that the PC business will have a hard time growing next year. Are you guys anticipating being able to grow the PC business and what will help drive that growth? Dion Weisler : Well, let me start sort of long-term, and Cathie might want to weigh in a little more than that. I\u2019d still remind everybody this is still a $333 billion market that one in five machines got an HP logo on it, means four out of five don\u2019t; that represents opportunity for us. I\u2019ve said consistently that the market is consolidating; the top four grew 3.5%. We grew at 2.5-point premium to that. So, certainly, the big is getting bigger and we are growing much faster than the big four. And that\u2019s really off the back of strong innovation to this lineup, I think we have ever had, we are getting incredibly positive reviews consistently. It\u2019s a continuous transformation of the business to more profitable subcategories, finding where the heat is into the market and where we can get value for the innovation that we are creating. And in quarter four, that paid off yet again. We saw topline -- strong topline growth, sequential growth in operating profit. We saw year-over-year share gains. But those share gains, I\u2019ll remind everyone and not an objective but rather an outcome of all of this work. There is no single magic pill that was all categories, all regions. The channel inventory was well under control. We aged inventory was well-managed. I think really kudos to the team both regionally within the business units, the supply chains and the functions. I think we are in a very good position to compete as we go forward in this market. Cathie Lesjak : And I think, Ron laid out at the Security Analyst Meeting the fact that core traditional PC market from a unit and revenue perspective would be down in 2018 over 2017. But, as you\u2019ve seen and as Dion talked about, we are playing our game and we know how to compete and win. We\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019ve got a great cost structure that we do hyper-segmentation and that we reinvest back into innovation, so that we can grow the market. The compares are tougher, no question about that. I mean, last year, we grew 10% in Q1 year-over-year, 10% in Q2, 12% in Q3 and now 13% in Q4. So, there are tough compares. But we know how to operate in this environment, and to outgrow our competition. Sherri Scribner : And then, just a question on Samsung. I think you mentioned 1.9 billion in revenue to add. Can you give us some sense of how that breaks out between supplies and hardware units? And then, also on the margins, just to clarify, would you expect to be below the 16% to 18% operating margin in the first half of the year because of the dilution from acquisition or do you think you can still be in that 16% to 18% range? Dion Weisler : Why don\u2019t I sort of stop, because I know, we\u2019ve got some new investors that have come into the stock and I think it\u2019s important to reiterate and recall why this transaction was important to us, given that we\u2019ve just closed the transaction, and then Cathie can talk specifically to those numbers. First of all, we welcome the Samsung print team to our family. And for our new investors, we bought this business for three primary reasons. Firstly, the A3 market is a $55 billion market and we are underpenetrated in that market relative to the A4 market where we have very strong market leadership. The traditional A3 players operate very complex machines, if you were to break those machines down, they would -- you would see thousands of parts on the ground. The Samsung technology really disrupts those traditional copiers with copier level performance but significantly less complex machine, the thousands of parts, when you were to break a Samsung down would be hundreds of parts. And this lowers the cost to operate and that translates to increased margins for our partners and/or lower cost per page for our customers. So, we have an extremely strong portfolio when you put our technology together with the Samsung technology now, HP technology in both the A4 and A3 spaces in Ink, in PageWide, and in Laser, the second reason is that we integrated it, the A3 and the A4 portfolio which really increases our managed print services capability, there\u2019re certain customers and tenders that would come out, that had a requirement for a mixed deployment of both A3 and A4 and were often excluded from those A4 deals. Now having a very full portfolio, actually opens up A4, new A4 opportunities for us. And the third is, we now have incredible thing, we inherited more than a 1,000 top class engineers, industry-leading R&D team in laser space, includes go-to-market capability more than 6,500 patents being added to our core. And I think this newly combined team is increasingly diverse and industry-leading. And so with that we have a lot of confidence in our ability to attract at least 12 points -- or 12% of A3 market share in the next three years. Cathie Lesjak : And then with respect to Samsung\u2019s business, some of the things to keep in mind is that the revenue that I talked about for FY18 is $1.4 billion and the business that Samsung has is mostly A4 laser. And within that historically has been largely low-end laser, which means their supplies mix, as a percentage of the total print business is materially lower than our current business. And our job is to obviously improve that but they are -- they do run quite a bit lower in terms of percentage of revenue. In terms of the margins, I\u2019ll leave it up to you to actually do the math on whether or not you think they drop below 16%. We know that in the very short term, there\u2019s pressure from the Samsung business but over the long term, we\u2019ll get back to good strong margins. Operator : The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : I just wanted to follow up on Samsung. So, I think when you bought the business, you said it was a $1.8 billion business and supplies were about $1 billion, you\u2019re guiding for a $1.4 billion for next year. Maybe you can tell us what the trailing 12 months was. And given that supplies shouldn\u2019t roll off all that quickly that feels like a really dramatic decline in hardware, and maybe you can speak to that? And I\u2019ve a follow-up, please. Cathie Lesjak : So, Toni, in terms of $1.8 billion, that was the 2015 revenue for the Samsung printing business. But, we\u2019ve never talked about what the percentage was of that that was supplies, and they run materially lower on supplies as a percentage of the revenue mix than HP does. So, I can\u2019t really talk to that. But what is pretty typical is that when you have a long period between announce and close, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty and customers make choices. Right? And so, we\u2019re not surprised by the fact that Samsung printing has lost market share and declined their revenues. And keep in mind again, this is mostly in the A4 -- low-end A4 Laser space, and that\u2019s really not the reason why we bought the Samsung printing business, we really bought it to disrupt the A3 copier space. Toni Sacconaghi : Just, if we\u2019re ever going to really know what your organic supplies growth rate is next year, we really need to know how much is coming from Samsung. So, if you are not going to give it out now, are you going to be giving it out in the future? And then, my follow-up or separate question is just on PC ASPs; they were up about 8% year-over-year, which I think is a reflection of DRAM and some of the high-end targeting that you guys have done. I guess, the question would be, why wouldn\u2019t we expect pretty rich ASP declines again in fiscal 2018, particularly in the first half? Cathie Lesjak : Okay. In terms of Samsung, one of the challenges we are absolutely going to have on a go forward basis is with Samsung is that if we do our job right and we fully merge and integrate the HP print business with the Samsung printing business, we are going to be doing things like optimizing the portfolio and completely integrating go-to-market and R&D. So, it will become increasingly difficult for us to break out what was -- what is the Samsung\u2019s printing business versus the HP Printing business. So that will be a challenge on a go forward basis. We can discuss and decide whether or not we are going to talk about supplies, tell you what the supplies percentage is of the $1.4 billion. But, on a go forward basis, it\u2019s going to be very difficult. We will do the best we can, so that we can give you a good view of whether or not we are flat to slightly up on supplies, and we expect that we will be without Samsung. Dion Weisler : The other thing to remember Toni on Samsung is that still the largest portion of the composition of the revenue today is A4. You\u2019ll recall that we acquired these assets, so the A3 capability which was still largely in an investment mode. And so, as we move more and more into the A3 market and we shift the business from transactional to contractual, that generally comes with the higher supplies attraction. And so the composition of supplies over time is indeed going to change. Cathie Lesjak : And then, in terms of your question on ASPs, Toni, can I just ask a clarifying question? You talked about the ASPs being up year-over-year as a result of the kind of the pressures from commodity costs and the repricing actions that we took. And I agree that is -- big piece of it as is the mix shift to higher end products, things like premium, gaming and work stations. But, then, you said why wouldn\u2019t we expect a decrease, did you say in -- a material decrease in ASPs in 2018, is that what you asked? Toni Sacconaghi : No, I\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t clear. I was saying why would you not expect a similar level of ASP increases, particularly in the first half of the year and a substantial increase still year-over-year? Cathie Lesjak : So, on a year-over-year basis, we do expect that there will be an increase in ASPs related to commodity costs but what we\u2019ve been talking about in terms of the counter pressure is that the currency environment has gotten -- the currencies have gotten much stronger. And therefore there is kind of the counterbalance to that is what are the pressures going to be, the competitive pressures to actually decrease local currency prices in the foreign markets? And that\u2019s where we think there could be some significant downward pressure in ASPs for Personal Systems. Operator : The next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : I have one follow-up on Samsung, then another. So, with regard to Samsung, sort of operationally, how are you thinking about the integration? And I\u2019m trying to figure out within the one penny of accretion, how much synergy is in there or how much visibility you had prior to the closing the deal three weeks ago? And then, I have a follow-up. Dion Weisler : Thanks, Shannon. Of course, we were competitors up until that sort of 20 days ago. And so, you can imagine, this is somewhat of a tricky acquisition in terms of exactly how much information that we had leading into the closure. I would say, still very early days. The integration is going incredibly well; the team is incredibly focused on our customers, doing all the right things. But, we\u2019re learning every day as we get under the covers of this business. We would expect that as our team looks at best industry practice that\u2019s got us to the position where we are today that there will indeed be opportunities to capture those synergies. But, I would just say, it\u2019s a little too early, not more than 20 days into the acquisition, to give you a lot of specifics around that. Shannon Cross : Okay. And then, sort of utilizing those synergies or maybe incremental synergies, you have 3D printing, you A3, I guess, gaming on the on the PC side and some other investments that your making. How are you engaging the level of investment per initiative or how are you thinking about the return on what you\u2019re doing? And then, on the other side, I would assume continuing to reduce costs and simplify the business within sort of the core that may be isn\u2019t growing as much as some of your growth opportunities. Dion Weisler : Well, I think you\u2019ve actually summarized it really well. We focus incredibly on cost, it\u2019s table stakes. You have to be in the right cost position. If you\u2019re not on the right cost position, you don\u2019t have the opportunity to make investments. As it relates to investments, we feel good about the investment choices ahead of us. We believe we can create significant shareholder value. As we outlined at the Security Analyst Meeting, we have confidence in our ability to execute and hope that we\u2019ve dropped $1 or $2 in the trust bank over the course of the last couple of years to demonstrate that we can execute. I would say that our investment thesis and process that we follow is that we identify investment opportunities across the business, we weigh them all against one another. We\u2019re very targeted to ensure that the investments that we do make advance our strategy, so that we don\u2019t surprise anyone with the investments that we\u2019re making. We\u2019re very disciplined about establishing and hitting the milestones that we lay out. And ultimately, generating profitable growth is what it\u2019s all about. Growth for just growth sake is not particularly fascinating. I think segment by segment, we\u2019re demonstrating that those investments are good choices, investment systems, broadly in premium and specifically in gaming are great examples of investments that we made that are paying dividends right now. Same is true for graphics and the very targeted unit placements that Cathie talked about, NPV positive units and print. 3D printing has gone from a business that was nonexistent a year ago to a real business today, 65 channel partners around the globe in every single region and ecosystem that we\u2019ve developed, partners in Deloitte and Siemens, more than 50 materials partners that are starting to look at making materials for the platform, plus the technology announcements that we made at the Security and Analyst Meeting around a lower cost color platform and the technology announcements we\u2019ll make around metals in 2018. So, we\u2019re feeling good about our ability to execute in the core, in the growth areas that we outlined, as well as the future. Cathie Lesjak : And Shannon, just to remind you, this is all very returns based analysis. We step back and we look at what the investment is that\u2019s necessary and then what the opportunity is in terms of cash flows on a go-forward basis to determine whether or not, it will add value to the firm. And then, also to stack rank and determine which ones we are actually going to invest in. Operator : The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : I have a Samsung question, then a follow-up. So, Cathie, I think you said that the mix of hardware relative to supplies is intrinsically quite different in the Samsung business relative to the core HP business. Now, the shrinkage in revenue from the time you announced the $1.8 billion to $1.4 billion, I would think that\u2019s more or less hardware related. Is that a right assumption to make. And so, as the percentage mix that you are alluding to, is that something that holds true, both at the 1.8 billion and 1.4 billion level? And I have a follow-up. Cathie Lesjak : So, Wamsi, yes, the mix of the $1.4 billion in revenue for supplies is materially lower than the current HP business. Wamsi Mohan : But, would you say Cathie that the decline from 1.8 to 1.4 was largely hardware related? Cathie Lesjak : I think it was led by hardware but it had obviously ramifications for supplies as well. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. And if I could follow up. On the PC gaming market, maybe Dion, you could share some sense of how much share you are you gaining in this market? How big of a growth driver it was in fiscal 2017 out of your total growth? Maybe if you could give us how many points of growth was driven PC gaming, that\u2019d be great? Dion Weisler : We don\u2019t break it down at a segment level. And I think there are better sources of data to look at how much share we\u2019ve taken in that particular space. And I wouldn\u2019t want to make our analysts redundant. I would just say that this has been a material business for us that\u2019s grown up over the last 18 months from nothing to a sizable portion, not only in terms of revenue but the gross margin that it drives, as well as the halo effect that it has on the overall brand, which I think is lifting our premium segment as well as every other segment that we had within the PC business. This is an incredible franchise; it\u2019s a growing franchise; the airier is growing. And there is more people that are tuning in to these battlegrounds than game 7 of the NBA. So, we like being in this business and we see the growth continuing. Operator : The last question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. I guess, I need to start with the Samsung question as well. I guess, Cathie, it sounds like the deal is dilutive near-term. Your Jan quarter EPS guide that you guys gave us essentially bracking The Street numbers. Could you quantify what the EPS dilution is in the Jan quarter from Samsung and what\u2019s the timeline to get this asset back to the 16%, 18% margin range that you guys have talked about core IPG historically? Cathie Lesjak : So, Amit, we are not going to break down Samsung in that level of detail quarter-by-quarter. I think it\u2019s suffice it to say that with our guide for Q1 2018 of $0.40 to $0.43 for non-GAAP EPS, we are covering and absorbing the little bit of headwind that we get from Samsung. And I\u2019m sorry, what was the second part of your question? Amit Daryanani : The second part was really -- you\u2019ve talked about the Samsung asset longer term being in line to core IPG margins, 16% to 18%, what sort of timeline is that, is that a fiscal 2020 target or is that much more longer term than that? Cathie Lesjak : It will take us some time, but we\u2019ll see pretty consistent progress over the next few years to get it back to those levels. Dion Weisler : I think it\u2019s really worth reiterating why we acquired this asset. It was not to buy revenue. And I\u2019m being pretty clear about that as is Cathie. We don\u2019t chase share for share\u2019s sake. And whilst the revenue is interesting, it\u2019s not fascinating. What\u2019s fascinating for us is the incredible disruptive technology that this team invented to take on a pretty unconsolidated A3 $55 billion copier market with a better mousetrap that enables our partners to earn more money and enables a lower cost per page for our customers with a very different value proposition from a servicing perspective. More than a 1,000 engineers of very rich portfolio of patents. It\u2019s all of those reasons that we\u2019ll pay dividends over time that we\u2019re incredibly interested in and why we acquired this asset and we\u2019re just kind of getting started in this space. Amit Daryanani : And if I could just follow up on the core PC business, could you tell us how much of a headwind did you guys have on operating margins from memory right now? I mean, year-over-year, it is down about 50 basis points; revenue is up double-digits. So, just trying to get sense, how much memory had been you dealing with on op margin basis? Cathie Lesjak : So, Amit, if you look at the total year, our commodity costs headwind was about a $1 billion. And so, we\u2019ve actually done -- I think Dion talked about, we\u2019ve done a really good job of managing in what has been a very tough industry-wide commodity cost environment. And we\u2019ve done that by leveraging our balance sheet, looking at basically buying strategic -- doing some incremental strategic purchases to assure ourselves of supply, entering into longer term agreements, so that we not only assure ourselves of supply but also that we are able to negotiate better prices. We also have mitigated it by using our balance sheet by putting more product on the sea and then, when all of that -- we figure all that out and then we look at what kind of repricing that we\u2019re able to do and still be able to be very competitive in the market. And in fact, as you see, significantly outgrow the market with kind of all of those tactics coming together. Dion Weisler : So, with that, I want to take the opportunity to thank you all. I have been Americanized and I understand, it is a season of Thanksgiving, and we\u2019re between you and a turkey. So, I want to thank you for following us through the course of our reinvention journey. Our results give us real confidence in the trajectory of our business going forward. We\u2019re leading in our core markets, we\u2019re entering new growth markets and natural adjacencies and at the same time investing in the future. We\u2019ve never been more competitive. We remain humble and focused. We\u2019re proud of the results that we\u2019re delivering and proud that we\u2019ve been very open and transparent and dependable. We think it\u2019s been a great year of reinvention and we\u2019re just getting started. Thanks all. Have a great Thanksgiving. Cathie Lesjak : Happy Thanksgiving. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to the First Quarter 2018 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is William, and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to our host for today's call, Steve Fieler, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Steve Fieler : Good afternoon. I'm Steve Fieler, head of treasury for HP Inc., and I'd like to welcome you to the fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings conference call with Dion Weisler, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Dion, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of this webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and the accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2018, and HP's other SEC filings. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release. And now I'll hand it over to Dion. Dion Weisler : Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Right out of the gate, we're off to a strong start for the fiscal year. A great quarter of double-digit revenue and earnings per share growth year-over-year speaks to our ability to deliver consistent and sustained momentum across our portfolio and across regions. To echo what I've said many times, we're playing our own game, delivering operational excellence, predictable shareholder returns and prioritizing profitable growth. And we're doing this while building the business for the long term and investing in our core growth and future strategic framework. And while our strategy remains consistent, every day, we are improving and refining our business and go-to-market execution. We are engineering some of the best innovations in our history to enhance value for our customers and partners. We're evolving business models to match changing customer needs and market realities, and we're constantly looking for ways to improve our overall cost structure, and it's working. Quarter 1 was impressive across many dimensions. We delivered another quarter of top line growth year-over-year with net revenue up 14% to $14.5 billion and growth across all 3 regions in both Personal Systems and Print. We drove bottom line growth as well in Personal Systems and Print with year-over-year increases in operating profit dollars. We delivered $0.48 of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, up $0.10 compared to Q1 of last year. Even when you adjust for the tax rate benefit from U.S. tax reform, we earned $0.44 in Q1, up 16% year-over-year and above our previously guided range of $0.40 to $0.43. And we delivered nearly $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and returned 71% of it to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As you know, Congress passed the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in our fiscal Quarter 1. HP supported tax reform and believes it will make the U.S. more globally competitive and help stimulate the economy. We expect tax reform to benefit HP's stakeholders and are planning for a lower go-forward effective tax rate. We believe this will help us drive higher net earnings, strengthen our balance sheet and increase our near-term shareholder return opportunities. We expect it will also create capacity for us to invest in our business, including incremental investments in our workforce. We intend to use a portion of our annual tax savings to invest back into our nonexecutive employees by increasing their ongoing annual variable performance bonus opportunity. Cathie will walk you through more details on U.S. tax reform in her remarks. Now let me cover HP's segment performance. Personal Systems had a terrific start to FY '18. Net revenue grew 15% year-over-year, marking 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth. Let me repeat : 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth. And this quarter comes on top of 10% growth in Q1 of FY '17 versus the prior year. We also achieved the trifecta : share gains, revenue gains and profit dollar growth. Congratulations to this team for a stellar job. Performance was strong and broad based across all segments, product categories and regions. We achieved double-digit growth in Consumer and Commercial in Notebooks, Desktops and Workstations, and in the Americas, EMEA and APJ. Personal Systems continues to deliver strong financial results, unrivaled innovation and, ultimately, is shaping the future of personal computing. Underpinning our market success is amazing design, innovation and a consistent focus on leveraging customer insights to create and deliver experiences that amaze. But it's not just us saying we have the most innovative product lineup. At January's Consumer Electronics Show, we took home 77 awards for innovation. And despite being a consumer show, our awards recognized our Consumer and Commercial lineup as we continue to design for OneLife, products at the intersection of home, work and mobile. We introduced convertible PCs, such as the latest 15-inch Spectre x360, and new innovations like HP Pavilion Wave that brings Amazon Alexa to a powerful compact desktop. And we showcase continued leadership and security and manageability with products like the updated EliteBook 800 series. In gaming, we continue to be well positioned to capitalize on market opportunities with our OMEN lineup. We announced enhanced streaming in these powerhouse products, including the incredible OMEN X big format gaming display with NVIDIA G-SYNC. And as the market accelerates with a service-led economy, our Device as a Service solutions continue to gain traction. Last week, we announced DaaS offerings to Apple devices to support our multi-OS leadership. Device as a Service supports our customers with the ability to drive efficiencies, free up capital and IT resources, and improve employee experience with technology. Our focus on providing incredible experiences to our partners and customers contributed to market share gains. In calendar Quarter 4, the PC market grew both in units and revenue. We outpaced the market growth in every region, extending our #1 unit market share to 23.5%, up 1.7 points year-over-year. As we've said before, market share continues to be an outcome of great innovation and operational excellence, not an objective. Much like Personal Systems, the Print business is off to a fantastic start. In Q1, we grew revenue and operating profit and placed more good units. And we did this irrespective of the addition of our Samsung Print transaction. Total Print revenue was up 14% year-over-year with growth across Consumer hardware, Commercial hardware and Supplies. We're seeing growth across all regions and broadly across the business. As I've talked about, we are reinventing how the world experiences Print, and the business is more relevant than ever. Supplies revenue grew 10% year-over-year, marking another quarter of substantial progress and supporting our confidence in the Four Box Model to drive health in the Print business for the long term. Let me highlight a few areas of Print progress as part of our growth strategy. Graphics revenue grew year-over-year largely driven by Indigo and PageWide presses. Managed Print Services revenue grew year-over-year as businesses continued to shift to contractual printing. In IDC's most recent report on the smart multifunction print market, HP was the recognized leader for both A4 and A3 across laser and PageWide. IDC recognized HP as the #1 vendor in both capability and strategy. And in A3, we're gaining market share both year-over-year and sequentially. In Quarter 1, we added an important new functionality to our A3 PageWide products for the Enterprise with low-cost color, maximum uptime and best-in-class security. And we're excited to have closed the Samsung Print acquisition as of November 1, 2017, that we'll now call S-Print going forward. We have now created a larger Print family, which will help us address the $55 billion A3 market opportunity along with adding capabilities and revenue in A4. The integration efforts and key initiatives are on track. We're joining teams, combining our product portfolios, onboarding new partners, rationalizing SKUs and streamlining processes. Q1 also marked more milestones for our 3D Printing business. Earlier this month, we introduced a lower-cost color solution that, for the first time in the industry, creates engineering-grade prototype, functional parts in black or a full spectrum of color, including white. This opens up a whole new TAM, and importantly, we're now the only 3D printing provider that enables both prototyping and industrial final part production on the same underlying technology platform. We also introduced a future collaboration with Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, a world leader in 3D design software to unlock new voxel-level possibilities for product developers. And we continue to grow within our key verticals and add new customers, such as FedEx and the U.S. Marine Corps. Overall, I'm very pleased with our Q1 results and the vitality of our business. But as always, we have more work to do. We are never satisfied, and we'll continue to build on HP's strong foundation and incredible opportunities ahead. Every day is a new opportunity to embrace change, accelerate our thinking and deliver for the market and for our customers. We're leading in the core with sprinkles of magic across our portfolio. We've entered adjacent markets with disruptive IP and strategies where we can provide differentiation and accelerate industry shifts. And we're investing in our future, creating categories with potential upside for decades to come. We're also investing in lending our voice to what makes HP an important company in the world, from sustainability and the environment to diversity and inclusion, we believe it's not just what we do but how we do it. Deep in our DNA, we believe in leveraging the power of the company to benefit societies and the communities in which we operate. These efforts underpin our business focus and our corporate values. This is a very exciting time to be at HP. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Cathie to provide more details on our performance and our financial outlook. Catherine Lesjak : Thanks, Dion. We delivered strong results in Q1 with impressive revenue growth and year-over-year increases in operating profit dollars, free cash flow and earnings per share. Before getting into specific Q1 performance, I want to first provide some context on tax reform and its impact on our results. There are many broad and complex elements to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that require extensive tax analysis, much of which is ongoing as government authorities share further clarifying publications. We expect additional details to be available in the months ahead, so on today's call, I'll highlight the largest impact areas and provisional adjustment. I'll then later summarize the combination of these impacts in our financial outlook. For starters, we recorded a noncash tax-related accounting gain of $1.1 billion in our Q1 GAAP-only results. This $1.1 billion gain is a net number, inclusive of the expected repatriation transition tax charge and other net accounting benefits. Under the new tax code, U.S. companies are required to pay a repatriation transition tax on offshore earnings that have not been previously repatriated to the U.S. We booked a gross repatriation charge of $3.2 billion with payments to be made over the published 8-year schedule. However, the actual cash payments will likely be much lower as we expect to reduce the overall liability by more than half once existing and future credits and other balance sheet attributes are used. We've also recorded a net $4.3 billion accounting benefit in the quarter, which more than offsets the gross repatriation tax. This provisional adjustment is a result of reversing previously accrued-upon earnings from foreign subsidiaries, which are netted against revaluing our deferred tax assets and liabilities at a lower 21% U.S. tax rate. In Q1, we also saw a positive impact on our effective tax rate. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 15% compared to our previously provided guidance range of 21% to 22%. The 6.5 point tax rate delta generated approximately $0.04 of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share in the quarter. With this context in mind, let me now cover the Q1 results. Net revenue was $14.5 billion, up 14% year-over-year as reported or 13% in constant currency. And our performance remained strong across businesses and geographies. Regionally, year-over-year, Americas grew 10%, EMEA was up 13% and APJ grew 18%, all in constant currency. Gross margin of 17.8% was up 10 basis points year-over-year, driven by improved rate in Printing, partially offset by higher commodity cost in Personal Systems. Gross margins were down 30 basis point sequentially in line with normal seasonality. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.6 billion were up 17% year-over-year or 5% sequentially driven by the addition of S-Print along with incremental R&D and go-to-market investments to support growth. Net OI&E expense was $66 million for the quarter. With a non-GAAP tax rate of 15% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.48 or $0.44 when adjusting for the previously estimated 21% to 22% tax rate compared to the 15% recorded. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes restructuring and other charges of $31 million, acquisition-related charges of $42 million, amortization of intangible assets of $20 million, partially offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $56 million and the related tax impact on these charges. Most significantly, we recorded a provisional $1.1 billion net gain for the adjustments resulting from the U.S. tax reform. In Q1, GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $1.16. Turning to the segments. Personal Systems net revenue remained very strong, delivering $9.4 billion, up 15% year-over-year as reported or 13% in constant currency. The results continue to be broad based, reflecting our innovative product portfolio and global execution. By customer segment, Consumer revenue was up 13% and Commercial revenue was up 16% year-over-year. By product category, Notebooks were up 14%, Desktops up 17% and Workstations up 11% year-over-year. Personal Systems operating profit dollars grew year-over-year and operating margin was 3.6% in the quarter, which is down 20 basis points sequentially and year-over-year. We saw industry-wide increases in component costs again in Q1 driven primarily by DRAM, which continues to put pressure on margin. We now expect to see increased component costs throughout FY '18 and, therefore, are mitigating via pricing, supply chain scale and leveraging our balance sheet, driving positive mix shifts and currency favorability. Together, these actions should enable us to offset some of the commodity cost increases. Before turning to Printing, let me add a little more color on S-Print since our financials include a full quarter of results. As a reminder, last quarter, we updated our full year FY '18 guidance to include the operational impact of the acquisition. We estimated $1.4 billion of revenue and added $0.01 of non-GAAP net earnings per share to our full year outlook. We highlighted that, as expected, S-Print's hardware and Supplies revenue base was in decline driven by low-end A-4 products. We also describe that S-Print would be in investment mode during the first half of the fiscal year, putting pressure on overall Print margins before becoming profitable during the second half. It's important to reemphasize that we intend to integrate the business across the globe as quickly as possible. This is fundamental to our value-creation plan and includes rationalizing SKUs with 25% of Samsung-branded SKUs already reduced by the end of Q1, combining the respective Samsung and HP-branded products into an integrated portfolio for our collective sales force, and transitioning the S-Print installed base into the HP sales model. The faster we integrate, the quicker we create value, and this is exactly our plan. A direct result of this integration strategy is that we are unable to accurately size organic versus inorganic hardware units or revenue results. Said differently, depending on the actual tradeoffs already being made in the field, the additional $1.4 billion of acquisition revenue in FY '18 may indeed come from either Samsung or HP-branded SKUs. From a reporting perspective, we have included all S-Print hardware in Commercial hardware revenue and units since the integration is being led by our office business. As a result, there is no impact to Consumer hardware revenue or units at this time. In the future, we may realign these SKU-level results depending on the organizational ownership at that time. Now getting back to Printing performance. Revenue was $5.1 billion in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year or up over $600 million. We're very pleased with this growth with or without the impact from S-Print. Total hardware units were up 14% year-over-year with Consumer units up 7% and Commercial units up 73%. In calendar Q4, overall Print unit share was 38%, down 2 points year-over-year. Moving to Q1 Supplies performance. Revenue of $3.4 billion was up 10% year-over-year, which includes approximately 6 points of S-Print supplies. We do not anticipate breaking out S-Print's specific Supplies results in future quarters due to the integration progress that has already been made and, specifically, the impact that hardware unit placements in Q1 would have on future supplies. Overall, our Supplies results reflect our sustained efforts around stabilizing supplies and an easier year-over-year compare. We believe that the Four Box Model remains a good predictor of our Supplies performance, and we continue to operate below our channel inventory ceiling. We're in the early days of A3 but remain confident and optimistic about the opportunity ahead. An important marker for success of A3 and for our S-Print acquisition is making steady progress towards our goal of achieving at least 12% market share of A3 hardware units by the end of fiscal '20. In calendar Q4, we achieved 7.9% total share, including both S-Print and HP. We also continue to make progress in our contractual offerings, including good momentum with Instant Ink, where we are growing our global subscriber base. Print operating profit dollars grew $87 million year-over-year, and operating margin was 15.8% in the quarter, down 20 basis points year-over-year and 80 basis point sequentially. The largest driver of the margin decline is the impact of adding S-Print. We expect that our Q1 operating margin rate will be the low for the year. Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was $996 million and free cash flow was $977 million in the quarter. We finished Q1 with a $1.2 billion net debt position, which includes the approximately $1 billion in funding for S-Print. Cash conversion cycle was minus 27 days, which weakened 3 days sequentially driven by an 8-day decrease in days payable outstanding, offset by a 2-day decrease in days sales outstanding and a 3-day decrease in days of inventory. We have been deliberately building our owned inventory and accounts payable balance steadily in FY '17 and specifically in Q4 as we leveraged our balance sheet to address rising component costs and to support growth. In Q1, we typically adjust these balances down for seasonality, and we shifted more this year, given the higher beginning balances. During Q1, we had a total capital return of $692 million through $462 million in share repurchases and $230 million in cash dividends. With tax reform, our long-term capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. However, we will now have the opportunity to more efficiently access our global cash and run the business with lower levels of cash on the balance sheet. We are still finalizing the specific timing and quantity of repatriated cash, and we'll update you more in the months to come. In addition to supporting operating cash needs, our priorities for using this cash are, first, ensuring that we maintain our existing investment-grade credit rating. We plan to reduce our gross debt levels, taking into consideration our resulting net debt position after repatriation, the tax repatriation, cash liability and share repurchases. Second, opportunistically returning capital to shareholders with a focus on incremental share repurchase. Third, investing in our nonexecutive workforce as Dion described. And finally, we're not changing our disciplined and returns-based approach to capital allocation, including M&A. Looking forward, keep the following in mind related to our financial outlook : In Personal Systems, we now expect that the overall cost of components driven primarily by memory will continue to increase throughout FY '18. This headwind and any net impact on repricing will ultimately depend upon actual market demand and competitive dynamics, including offsets from gross currency benefits. In Printing, we expect that Samsung-branded supplies continue to decrease due to declines in the historical installed base. Overall, we expect that total Supplies revenue, inclusive of both legacy HP and S-Print, to be up 5% to 7% in constant currency for the aggregate remainder of FY '18. Looking forward to FY '19, we expect the overall Supplies business to be flat to slightly up in constant currency. In addition, we expect to opportunistically place units with a positive NPV. For the full year, we expect to deliver our productivity initiatives as guided at SAM. We also continue to look at opportunities to take cost out of the business, especially with the close of S-Print, overall commodity cost environment and the opportunity to expand the TAM of positive NPV units. We'll also continue to leverage our balance sheet if we see attractive economic opportunities to do so. We have factored in the various tax reform implications in our full year non-GAAP outlook. We estimate our go-forward effective tax rate to be 16% plus or minus 2 points, which is improved from our previously guided FY '18 tax rate between 21% to 22%. This generates a full year diluted net earnings per share benefit of approximately $0.13, of which $0.04 has already been earned in Q1. Importantly, the 16% rate plus or minus 2 points is a full year outlook. We are likely to see more quarterly variations to the rate just like we saw in the lower Q1 15% rate, which is now expected to create a sequential tax headwind in Q2. Partially offsetting the $0.13 full year diluted net earnings per share tax benefit is an approximately $0.03 diluted net earnings per share investment during the remainder of the year to fund the higher variable performance bonus opportunities for nonexecutives, which will be recorded in the segment's operating results. Therefore, the net U.S. tax reform benefit is approximately $0.10 per share for the full year with approximately a $0.02 benefit in each remaining quarter in FY '18. From a GAAP-only perspective, our guidance now includes an incremental noncash $20 million charge per quarter for amortization of intangibles related to the S-Print acquisition. We have not assumed other GAAP-only adjustments related to the U.S. tax act other than the onetime $1.1 billion accounting gain already recorded in Q1. However, our tax analysis is ongoing and tax guidance is still being regularly clarified by government authorities, which may impact our go-forward tax model or accounting and, therefore, result in future adjustments. With all that in mind, we expect Q2 '18 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.45 to $0.49, including the $0.02 net benefit from U.S. tax reform. Q2 '18 GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.42 to $0.46. We are raising our full year fiscal '18 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share by $0.15, including the $0.10 net benefit from U.S. tax reform. The range is now $1.90 to $2. And our full year fiscal '18 GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $2.53 to $2.63. Before transitioning to Q&A, I want to update you on prospective changes to our earnings calendar. We're looking to move our earnings calls in future quarters closer to the date of quarterly or annual reports with the SEC. The changes in the number of dates will depend on the specific quarter, and we'll continue to announce our earnings call dates about 2 weeks prior to each call. I know there are a few new and somewhat complicated topics that we covered, so let me briefly summarize our quarter. We had impressive revenue growth and year-over-year operating profit dollar expansion across both segments with or without S-Print. We continue to make progress executing our core growth and future strategy. And we're investing in the business for the long term and, at the same time, committing to return capital to shareholders. With that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first questioner today will be Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani : I have 2 questions, I guess. Maybe the first 1 to start with, when I think about the 4% organic Supplies that you guys talked about in Q1, could you just maybe help connect that with the expectation that fiscal '18 will be flat to slightly up in Supplies, what do you guys see in the Four Box Model, I guess, that gives you pause that the trend you saw in Q1 doesn't sustain on an organic basis in Supplies? Catherine Lesjak : Sure, Amit. But let me just make sure it's clear what I said in my remarks because, what we said is that in -- for Q2 to Q4, we expect that the Supplies growth in constant currency would be 5% to 7%. That includes the Samsung-branded Supplies impact. And the way we came to that number, and this is really helping all of you have a milestone at which to measure us against, and that's that we took the base plan for HP core for FY '18 that we talked about at the Security Analyst Meeting, which was basically flat to slightly up in constant currency. And we layered into that, on top of that, the S-Print Supplies before the integration begins -- began, okay. And the result is that when you look at that on a year-to-year basis, it's 5% to 7% for Q2 to Q4. As you appropriately talked about in Q1, we were up 10%. We have about 6 points of Samsung-branded Supplies in Q1, and that's probably the only quarter in which it's a real clear inorganic piece that we can calculate. I'm sorry, are there other people hearing that? Hold on, you guys. We have music coming in. We're not quite sure why. Amit Daryanani : That sounds to be coming from the main speaker line Catherine Lesjak : Yes, maybe. Okay, sorry about that. So in Q1, 10% year-over-year Supplies growth, 6 points with Samsung-branded Supplies. And again, this was the first and only quarter we're really going to get a clean view of Samsung Supplies because those Supplies in Q1 really came from the preacquisition installed base. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have had SKU rationalization of about 25% of the S-Print SKUs have been reduced. And so going forward, some of what would have been originally considered part of a increasing install base for S-Print hardware is now really going to be HP. So there's not a clear cut. But in Q1, there wasn't that list that's with 4% of organic Supplies growth year-over-year. Dion Weisler : So let me just add, Amit, that we have really high confidence in the Four Box Model and the team's ability to drive improvements in each element of each of the 4 boxes. I think, Enrique and the regional presidents -- Nick, Christoph, Richard -- and the teams did a great job in stabilizing Supplies earlier than expected last year. I have confidence in the team's ability to deliver a successful integration of the S-Print business going forward so that our total Supplies business is flat to slightly up next year and the Four Box Model is delivering as predicted. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And if I could just follow up on the Personal Systems side. Again, overall revenue number is fairly impressive here, especially given the tough compares you guys have. Can you just maybe -- -- when you look at the performance there, what is enabling that? Is it share gain? Or is it end demand in PCs doing better? And I guess, your confidence that there isn't a channel build that's happening at this point in that segment. Dion Weisler : Well, I'm happy to kind of give you the bigger picture. And Cathie, if you want to give some tactical data points for the in-quarter numbers to the team, that would be helpful. I tend to remind folks every quarter this is still a massive $334 billion market, half of which is traditional hardware. And while 1 in 5 have an HP logo on it, I always remind our sales folks that 4 out of 5 potential customers are missing out on experiencing HP's magic. And so I like this market. I've always liked this market. I've been pretty consistent about that. I think we got the best portfolio in our history. It keeps on getting better, which is why we grew at a 7-point premium to the market last quarter, and I think we've shown that we can consistently do that. And while share gains are not the objective, we see upside in the outcome of engineering experiences that amaze. We're playing our own game. We're shifting our portfolio towards more profitable parts of the market, and we're taking share where we want to, and we're not taking share for share's sake. Our channel inventory continues to be well managed. I'm very confident that our strategy of innovation, of cost management, the team's ability to execute positions us well, not only for today but also well into the future. Catherine Lesjak : And Amit, if you look at what's going on in the market from a PC perspective, we are starting to see some signs of improved PC growth, both in calendar Q3 and in calendar Q4. We did see growth in units and revenue, although I will say the analysts are predicting that units will be down in traditional PCs this year with revenue roughly flattish. Some of the dynamics that are going on, our ASPs are up. They're up because we've been repricing -- we and the market -- the rest of the market have been repricing for commodity cost increases. But they're also up because we're getting a really nice mix shift to higher-end products, higher price, better margins. And so that is also helping with kind of revenue versus units. But we have seen some signs of life in Personal Systems. Operator : Our next questioner today will be Steve Milunovich with UBS. Steven Milunovich : You had a good cash flow quarter once again. And yet, you didn't raise the $3 billion-plus target. Was free cash flow above what you expected? And why couldn't we expect a higher number for the full year? Catherine Lesjak : So we're very pleased with the free cash flow this quarter. And it is pretty atypical for us to update our free cash flow guidance on a quarterly basis, so we are still at, at least $3 billion. That being said, there is -- we are starting to see some upside in that number. But keep in mind that free cash flow is really driven by earnings, obviously, but also what happens to the cash conversion cycle and also the business mix. And when we look at those components, we still -- we feel very confident in the at least $3 billion in free cash flow for the year. Steven Milunovich : Okay. And then I think you were looking for an improved Personal Systems margin as you go into the second half, figuring the comparison's improved. And maybe at the time, you were thinking that DRAM prices weren't going to rise. Should we still see an increasing Personal Systems margin in the second half? And to what degree does this new view on DRAM impact that? Catherine Lesjak : So let's start first with kind of our expectations around commodity cost, and they have changed. So if we go back to the Security Analyst Meeting, we really thought that they would start to level off, and we're kind of at the levels that they would stay at. And we have seen continued increase in fiscal Q1 for us, particularly in DRAM. And we now expect that to continue throughout the year. In terms of margin, we definitely saw ASP increases, again as a result of pricing that we've taken over the last year, mix, positive mix and currency. But that just wasn't enough to offset the commodity cost increases that we've seen, and so we are basically down 20 basis points year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. But one of the things I will ask you to just think through, mathematically, if we were able to offset 100% of our commodity cost increases but not generate any incremental profit on these commodity cost increases, it would be dilutive to margin. And the numbers that we're coming up with is somewhere between 15 and 20 basis points is the headwind, simply if we were able to 100% reprice for commodity costs, which we have not been able to do. Dion Weisler : And let me give you just some additional longer-term context as we discussed at SAM, our mix shifts and our relentless focus on cost will continue, but we will also see a positive evolution of operating profit dollars and margin, which we expect to happen in the medium to longer term as we do that mix shift. Remember, half of that $334 billion market is not in the traditional hardware. It's in other things like services and more profitable parts of the market, and we are mix shifting towards that over time. And as a result, we raised the high end of our range to 5% at the Security Analyst Meeting, and we feel confident in our strategy and in our ability to transform the portfolio over time. Catherine Lesjak : So we were in the 3% to 4% historical range. We think that we will remain in that range for the rest of the year. But keep in mind that we also -- we go after any revenue that isn't dilutive to our margins, and it would be really a mistake for us to just focus on rate and not on operating profit dollars because, ultimately, it's operating profit dollars that are going to generate cash flow long term. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Wamsi Mohan with Merrill Lynch. Wamsi Mohan : Dion, now that you've had the Samsung portfolio for over a quarter, has anything surprised you in the business? And do you anticipate making any changes to the rate or pace of investments needed there? And can you just give us some context. Has this Intel chip flaw had any impact on demand? Or do you anticipate any uptick in demand from that? And I have a quick follow-up for Cathie. Dion Weisler : Sure. Look, I would say the S-Print integration is going according to plan. We moved the head of our office Print business. He relocated to Korea with his family last year to oversee the process and the business, so we've got people from our traditional business inside the S-Print business and vice versa. We've combined our R&D orgs. We've created a new center of excellence in Korea. Remember that we added more than 1,000 incredible R&D engineers into the HP family and more than 6,500 patents. So I would say it's -- we're 1 quarter in and the business is operating as expected, and it's providing us with the opportunity to really accelerate our progress in the A3 $55 billion market, where we've been underpenetrated. So I feel good about that. The second question was... Wamsi Mohan : On the Intel chip flow. Dion Weisler : Intel. No, I don't think we've seen a broad reaction to the demand for PCs broadly or for the Intel platform. Obviously, we work very hard to make sure that we're providing the appropriate updates. Security is incredibly important to us and to our customers, and I think we're on the front foot there, reacting faster than all of our competitors. But I don't believe it's made a broad impact to demand. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Huberty : Two questions from me. The first is where do you think copier share could exit this fiscal year? And then when will the A3 market begin to pull through noticeable aftermarket revenue and really have some impact on Supplies? And then I'll ask my follow-up. Catherine Lesjak : So Katie, from a -- A3 hardware share perspective, as you know, our goal is to hit at least 12% in FY '20. And we had 7.9% share in the last calendar quarter and up both year-on-year and sequentially. So we're feeling confident and optimistic about what we can do in the copier space. The kind of reception from customers has been positive, and so it does take a little bit of time, with such a big transactional business that we have, for it to have a meaningful impact, but we are making progress. Dion Weisler : We continue to sign new channel partners. The pipeline is growing consistently in every single region. So this is obviously an area that we spend a lot of time. It is, again, a $55 billion market. We've been underpenetrated for a long time. We're making progress. More work to do and we're on track. Kathryn Huberty : Is there any meaningful Supplies impact yet? Or is that still to come from A3? Catherine Lesjak : It's not meaningful at this point in time. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : I have one for Dion and one for Cathie. Dion, I'm just trying to reconcile maybe qualitatively more than anything sort of the forces at work on Supplies. So Supplies organically have grown better than 2% for each of the last 3 quarters. And all the leading indicators sound good. The graphics business is growing. MPS is growing. You've commented for the last several quarters about placing profitable units. A3 is ramping. All of those would kind of suggest that Supplies actually should improve going forward. And yet, the guidance for fiscal '19 appears that it may be softer than what we've seen in recent quarters. So are there some offsetting takes that we're missing? Or how do we sort of square the circle here? Catherine Lesjak : Toni, so maybe I'll take that one. There are some forces outside of the core HP Supplies business in Samsung. Their installed base is continuing to come down pretty significantly, and their installed base is mostly low-end A4 laser and just not pulling the attach. And so we will, in FY '19, be flat to slightly up in constant currency. And I think that that's not inconsistent with what we've been talking about in last year or this year when you look at the easy compare that we had. Dion Weisler : I mean, it's not a surprise to us, I guess, is what Cathie's saying. We contemplated it. It was fed as an input into the Four Box Model, and the Four Box Model has been the strong predictor of outcomes for us. And as a result of that, we believe that Supplies in '19 will be flat to slightly up. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. And then just a follow-up. Cathie, currency has moved much more favorably since you provided your SAM guidance. Wouldn't that be an incremental tailwind to both revenue and EPS? And can you help quantify that for us? And then should we expect a 16% tax rate beyond fiscal '18? Catherine Lesjak : So let's start with the last question first. Yes, we expected in FY '19 our tax rate will be 16% plus or minus 2% so in line with FY '18. In terms of FX, you're right. At the time of SAM, we thought that the tailwind to revenue is going to be 1 to 2 points. With kind of exchange rates now, it's more like 2 to 3 points. And we saw in Q1, basically, 1.7 points worth of tailwind. But we also are starting -- are seeing basically commodity cost increases. And so that is basically being offset somewhat by the tailwind that we're seeing on the currency side. And then also just the pressure in the market. It's a very competitive market. The competitive dynamics are such that there is pressure to basically reprice. And so the combination of the commodity cost increase and the repricing assumptions basically say that the tailwind from currency in FY '18 versus '17 is still about 6 points -- $0.06. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Jim Suva with Citi. Jim Suva : One question for Cathie and then one for Dion. For Cathie, the operating margins in Print segment, which went down, I believe, about 20% -- 20 basis points year-over-year. Is that solely attributable to the Samsung integration or investing or something else? And then for Dion, with average selling prices of PCs going higher, are you seeing a average life of the PC be extended even more? Or what's your view on the current installed base average life of the PC going forward? Catherine Lesjak : So let me start with the Print margins. There are a few factors to consider. The first one is what you mentioned, and that's that S-Print, we have a full quarter of S-Print since we closed this transaction on November 1. And as we talked about on the last earnings call, S-Print is in investment mode in Q1 and, frankly, the first half of the year. And so that, of course, is diluting not only margins but also operating profit dollars. And that's probably one of the big impacts to the 15.8% versus the 16.6% that we saw last quarter. The second one is the NPV positive unit placement. We have seen a significant increase sequentially relative to normal seasonality with unit placements. And of course, we all know that you've got to place the units in order to get the recurring revenue on Supplies. So at this point in time, we do expect that the 15.8% will be the low point in the year since Samsung will help because it will continually improve over the course of the year. Dion Weisler : And on the second question, I'd say broadly speaking, there's quite a few forces acting on the pretty aged install base of Personal Systems today, given it's sort of about 5-plus years for the most part. But we see tablets down. We see mobile phones under pressure. And that's creating capacity for investment in other areas. And in the Personal Systems category, due in large part to the kind of innovation that we've been driving, we've been giving people a reason to upgrade. If you look at a PC of 5 years ago, it's probably unrecognizable from the products that we make today. Catherine Lesjak : It's ugly. Dion Weisler : It's ugly, yes. Unrecognizable. And as a result of that, I think we're not quite sure whether it remains at 5 years or whether it moves to 4 or it goes to 5.5, I think a lot of that depends on us as innovators. How can we keep an innovation engine alive that is giving customers a reason to update their equipment? What else is it going to do for their businesses? What else is it going to do for their personal lives? So we spend a lot of time thinking about how we can not only invigorate the different categories but how we can invent new categories. And it's incumbent, I think, on the industry to provide customers with a reason to upgrade. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Just one and then a follow-up. In terms of subscription services, I'm curious how do we think about the percent of your revenue that's now under contracts and recurring. I assume most of it's sort of weighted to Printing, but I'm also curious as to how Device as a Service for PCs is being received by customers. Catherine Lesjak : So maybe I'll start with kind of the contractual business as a percentage of our total business, and then Dion can handle how it's progressing. The contractual element is there. It's happening but it's relatively slow and gradual. We're pleased with the progress, but in terms of it having a meaningful impact on our top line or our bottom line, it's just going to take quite a bit longer. It's just not -- it's not that meaningful at this point in time. It is an important trend for our business both in Print as well as in Personal Systems because it does create an opportunity to drive incremental profit. Dion Weisler : And if you -- if we think more broadly about the big mega trends affecting societies, there is very clear evidence that markets are going to shift more from transactional motions to contractual motions where they value Everything as a Service. And so the investments that we're making in not only our Managed Print Services but in really very innovative Device as a Service offerings plays out over time. And to Cathie's point, as a percentage of revenue today, it's relatively small. The interest we see from customers to move to Everything as a Service and big customers, small customers and everything in between, is quite large. There's about a 6-point shift happening from transactional to contractual, and it varies country by country. But again, it's up to us to innovate in these markets served. The different types of customers, Gen Zs really want Everything as a Service, and we think we've got an incredibly exciting portfolio in that area. It's a great part of our pipeline going forward, both in terms of product innovation but also in terms of real sales funnel. Catherine Lesjak : And one of the big announcements that we made this past few weeks, I think, was really related to now us bringing Apple devices or being able to service Apple devices within a Device as a Service offering. And this is important because, in order to really do that well, you have to be multi-OS. You can't just be kind of your own product set. And so that's an additional kind of move forward for us. Dion Weisler : And Shannon, you know that well from Managed Print Services. You often walk into a company that has a fleet of many different vendors. And if you're going to be successful in Managed Print Services, you have to be able to take over the entire fleet regardless of where it comes from. The same is true for Personal Systems, and the strategic hook-up with Apple was a very important component to enable us -- to be able to service Apple devices as part of managed Device as a Service contract. Shannon Cross : Great. And then I think we've gotten through this call until now and not talked about 3D Printing. So I'm just curious as to what kind of update you can give there and what you're seeing from customers. Dion Weisler : So we remain very excited about the 3D Printing business. We laid out markers that we wanted you guys to continue to check back with us at the Security Analyst Meeting. One of those was the product portfolio. We said we were getting to full production -- full color, and we launched a low-cost prototyping product into the market a couple of weeks ago, which complements the production system that we already have. It's off the same platform technology, and that's really important as we get leverage from that single investment and pull it from a low-cost full-color platform all the way up to a full production system. We continue to make progress with our end customers with multiple repeat orders. We have continued to grow our channel. We continue to grow our materials partners. So that business is operating according to our plan, and we remain excited about its ability to tap into the $12 trillion manufacturing market over time. Catherine Lesjak : And I think there's 2 important points about that, the announcement with the low-price, full-color 3D printer. And one is Dion mentioned in his prepared remarks is that because it's the same platform, now for prototyping as well as production, that's unusual in the market. And so that's a draw. And then the other one is, over time, if we're really going to disrupt this $12 trillion manufacturing industry, we've got to get folks to design for 3D. It's not just replacing a part today that's injection molded. It's saying, is there a better way to design that part? And this lower-price printer is going to get placed in universities so that the new generation really starts thinking about designing from 3D right away. Operator : And our last questioner today will be Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Roderick Hall : I wanted to come back to this idea of Supplies growth in 2019 flat to slightly up. And at the same time, your A3 share is growing. And just see if you can help us understand why continued growth in A3 share doesn't drive increase in Supplies since that's such a big part of the net income? And then I have a follow-up to that. Catherine Lesjak : So Rod, it's not that A3 doesn't provide some lift in Supplies in FY '19. It's the other factors that are offsetting the good unit placement, kind of the A3 growth that we're seeing. We are -- with S-Print, we have an installed base that is declining. We have Supplies on low-end A4 laser that just doesn't have the same sort of attach at that price band. And so what we're doing is we're offsetting some of those headwinds and are confident in our ability to have Supplies stable, flat to slightly up in constant currency in FY '19. Roderick Hall : And then I wanted to -- I wouldn't mind if you'd comment on when that sort of all that underlying movement on the negative side of that equation kind of stabilizes and when we are -- actually see it growing. And then the second question I had was just on NAND pricing. I wanted to check and see if your views there have changed? I know DRAM kind of makes sense to us. But just double checking that you're not also thinking NAND continues to increase through the year? And whether you've changed any thinking there. Catherine Lesjak : So Rod, in terms of Supplies, 1 year at a time or maybe 1.5 years at a time. We've now talked about '19. Stay tuned. At the end of '19, we'll talk about '20. Dion Weisler : And with regard to sort of memory, broadly, we know that DRAM is obviously a headwind. There are other components in the very broad basket of components that some move up, some move down. There may be some pressure from NAND. The biggest material impact is from DRAM, and that's what the teams are looking to obviously reprice wherever they can. We look to offset that through other items within the basket of costs as well as our own noncomponent costs within the business. We selectively leverage our balance sheet to secure inventory. We shouldn't forget that. You can't reprice what you don't have. Our Supplies value that consistency. The sustainable partner to smooth their cost investments is very important to them, and that drives a closer relationship to secure components at rational prices. And I think we've demonstrated our ability to do that. We'll always remain aggressive in our pursuit of other noncomponent cost takedowns. It's part of our DNA. It's wired into the way we work, and we'll continue to drive the mix shift to higher-priced, higher-margin segments as we laid it out at SAM. Catherine Lesjak : And we are getting a little bit of a tailwind obviously from currency that helps us in fiscal '18 to offset. Dion Weisler : But overall, I would say in closing out that I'm really pleased with the vitality of our business and our Q1 results. Very broad based. It's no one single pill inside the company. It's Printing. It's Personal Systems. It's Notebooks. It's desktops. It's home. It's office. Impressive revenue growth and year-to-year operating profit improvement delivering across the portfolio. We're leading in the core. We're accelerating our growth initiatives. And we're investing and continuing to invest in our future. We're never satisfied. We know there's much more work to do. We need to remain humble and continue to innovate and amaze our customers. We think we have an incredible opportunity to move even faster, embrace the change that's happening within the industry, accelerate our own thinking and deliver for our partners and our customers. And as I always say, our [ reinvention ] journey is just beginning. I'm convinced the best years lie ahead of us, and this year will be no exception. Thank you all. Catherine Lesjak : Thank you. Operator : And the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] And please note that today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Beth Howe : Good afternoon. I am Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations for HP, Inc. and I would like to welcome you to the fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings conference call with Dion Weisler, HP\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and Cathie Lesjak, HP\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Dion, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and the accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations webpage at www.hp.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to the forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions please refer to HP\u2019s SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available now and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported on HP\u2019s Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2018 and HP\u2019s other SEC filings. During this webcast, unless otherwise specifically noted, all quarterly comparisons are year-over-year comparisons with the corresponding year ago quarter. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release for those reconciliations. And now I will hand it over to Dion. Dion Weisler : Thanks, Beth. Let me start by saying it\u2019s great to have you back on the Investor Relations team. I am quite pleased with our Q2 performance. It\u2019s yet another quarter of strength, growth and consistent execution of our reinvention. We are creating opportunities and taking advantage of favorable market dynamics to deliver strong revenue and profitability across our segments and our regions. This was our 10th quarter since separation and you are seeing a sharp focus on innovation and execution, continued improvement on our business fundamentals, and an intense focus on long-term and sustainable growth. Our winning formula is straightforward. We are focusing on delivering operational excellence, predictable shareholder returns and prioritizing profitable growth, all aligned to our core growth and future strategy. Looking at our Q2 fiscal year \u201818 results, we added $1.6 billion to the top line growing revenue 13% to $14 billion. We grew top line and bottom line in both Personal Systems and Print. We delivered nearly $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and repurchased $800 million of stock and we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.48, an increase of 20% and at the higher end of our range. The market remains dynamic and competitive, but I am confident in our strategy and ability to continue to grow faster than the market and out-execute the competition. We are playing our own game pursuing the heat in the market and our strategy is paying off. Let me review some of the highlights. Personal Systems delivered another exceptional quarter. Net revenue was up 14% and that comes on top of 10% growth a year ago on quarter two. This is now six consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. This performance and the innovation coming out of this team is nothing short of incredible. HP continued to outperform the PC market with broad-based growth across all segments and product categories, not only are we seeing strong growth in notebooks, this is also the third consecutive quarter of double-digit desktop growth. In the first calendar quarter, we outgrew the PC market by 4.6 points, achieving 22.7% share. While we are proud of these results, share gain continues to be an outcome not an objective. Profitable growth continues to be our focus. In quarter two, operating profit dollars grew double-digits and operating margins expanded 60 basis points to 3.8%. Our team continues to drive improved productivity and product mix. One of the ways we drive value and profitable growth is through careful segmentation and aggressively pursuing targeted opportunities. One example is healthcare where safety, security and regulatory compliance are critical. We recently introduced a portfolio of products purpose built for healthcare providers by optimizing clinical workflows with RFID readers and improving collaboration capability for telemedicine. And this is connected to our innovation story and the sprinkles of magic we deliver that continued to be recognized in the market as first and best. This past quarter, we introduced the world\u2019s first Chromebook detachable, the world\u2019s widest curved all-in-one and the world\u2019s first detachable in tablet with an integrated privacy screen. This is how we win with partners and customers. Much of our success is driven by the strength of our commercial channel and retail relationships. For us, the channel is a great competitive advantage. We are deeply committed to listening to our partners, understanding their customers\u2019 needs, and delivering innovation that drives growth. We are coming off three of our largest partner events of the year where we met with thousands of partners from all regions. Their response was tremendous and we are consistently hearing that our innovation engine and go-to-market programs are setting a new standard in helping them to grow their businesses. In addition to the core, we remain focused on our strategic growth areas. In Personal Systems this quarter, we made progress in areas such as retail point-of-sale and device-as-a-service, where we saw strong double-digit growth. In fact, we closed the deal with a major global fast food chain to implement both retail point-of-sale and device-as-a-service solutions. Just like Personal Systems, the Print business delivered the trifecta of revenue, profit and share growth in quarter two. Total Print revenue was up 11%, with growth across commercial hardware, consumer hardware and supplies. We are seeing growth across all regions and broadly across the business. Print units were up 13% and supplies revenue grew 8% further supporting our confidence in the health of the Print business for the long-term. The overall Print hardware market grew 1.7% in the first calendar quarter and we grew faster than the market adding 1 point of share. With our continued productivity initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency and lower product costs, we remain strongly positioned to place NPV positive units. We are on a journey to reinvent print and our focus on this enabled us to achieve several important and innovative milestones. We launched the HP NVISS Printer to the International Space Station in April, where it is currently in use alongside HP Z-Book workstations. We are investing in next-generation printing with a focus on modern lifestyle innovations like the new mobile-optimized HP LaserJet Pros and our expanded offering of HP voice-enabled printing. In A3, we continue to onboard new partners and gain year-over-year share. This business is strategic to us given the higher attach rates of supplies and services. Our A3 solutions provide our partners and customers with cost savings, increase manageability, and peace of mind with best-in-class security. As an example, ImageNet Consulting lowered its service cost are more than 15% using HP Smart Device Services remote management. And I am pleased with the progress in S-Print since the acquisition closed this past November. We continue to rationalize SKUs and streamline processes while we are working on new innovations and adding features and options that our customers and partners truly value. Finally, in our graphics solutions business, we closed our largest packaging deal ever with ePac Flexible Packaging, a leader in web-based digital printing that quadrupled its capacity with HP Indigo presses. We also unveiled the industry first hybrid latex printer capable of printing on both rigid and flexible materials for the print service provider community. As you know, the 3D printing business is a huge opportunity for us and one where we aim to disrupt the $12 trillion global manufacturing market. The growth trajectory and momentum behind this business continues. We are seeing an increase in customers placing repeat orders, upgrading their systems for higher volume manufacturing and scaling with double-digit unit installations. Forecast 3D, one of the oldest and largest 3D manufacturers in the U.S. is expanding and upgrading its entire fleet to our 4210 solutions as they respond to growing demand and full-scale production. They are expecting to produce millions of parts on Multi Jet Fusion in the coming year. And Jabil, one of the world\u2019s largest contract manufacturers is now deploying Multi Jet Fusion in the U.S. and Asia as part of their distributed manufacturing strategy. We continue to make incredible progress across key industry verticals and expand into new geographies, including our market entry into Mexico. Overall, I am very pleased with our Q2 results and the efforts of our team. But as always, we have more work to do. We are never satisfied and we see plenty of room for us to grow, innovate, improve our cost structure and adapt to an ever-changing marketplace. Now, before I turn the call over to Cathie, let me address the other news we announced today. After 32 incredible years and the last 11 years as Chief Financial Officer, Cathie and I have decided it\u2019s the right time to transition CFOs before she retires in early calendar 2019. Today, I am thrilled to announce the appointment of Steve Fieler, our Head of Treasury as HP\u2019s new CFO. Cathie will become our Interim Chief Operating Officer lending her experience and leadership to help define our future of operations. Both appointments will begin on July 1. On behalf of all HP employees and shareholders, I want to thank Cathie for her remarkable contributions and commitment to shareholder value. We have been on an amazing journey together since separation and Cathie deserves tremendous credit for helping drive our performance and reinvention as a company. She is being my partner for the last 3 years and I could not ask for a better confidant and leader. Cathie has also cultivated incredible shareholder respect through their integrity, transparency and world-class financial discipline. She has built a deep and talented finance organization capable of leading us into the future. Steve is a great example of that bench. Having worked with him for many years, I am excited to have him join my executive leadership team and I am looking forward to our partnership. Steve has an impressive background as a leader in finance and operations and has the reputation for operational excellence and accountability. He is a great addition to the team as we continue to drive long-term profitable growth. With that, I am now going to turn the call over to Cathie to provide more details on our performance and financial outlook. And Cathie after 46 earnings calls, make this a good one. Cathie Lesjak : Thanks, Dion. I have been privileged to serve as CFO for the past 11 years or as you noted 46 quarters, but who is counting. It has been an honor to work as part of the team with so many outstanding dedicated employees during a time of tremendous change and reinvention. With Steve taking over as CFO, I am convinced HP is in excellent hands. As many of you already know, Steve is an experienced finance and Investor Relations executive with a deep understanding of HP. He will be an outstanding CFO and a great successor. Now, looking at the results for Q2, we continue to deliver consistent results, with strong revenue growth and increases in operating profit dollars, free cash flow and earnings per share. Net revenue was $14 billion, up 13% or up 10% in constant currency. Our performance remains strong across businesses and geographies. Regionally, Americas grew 7%, EMEA was up 21% and APJ grew 13%. Gross margin was 19.3%, up 10 basis points year-over-year. Sequentially, gross margin was up 150 basis points higher than normal seasonality primarily driven by favorable rate in Personal Systems and improved mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.7 billion were up 16% driven by the addition of S-Print, along with incremental R&D and go-to-market investments to support growth. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $84 million for the quarter, with a non-GAAP tax rate of 16% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.6 billion shares. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.48. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes restructuring and other charges of $57 million, acquisition-related charges of $45 million, amortization of intangible assets of $20 million, debt extinguishment cost of $126 million as well as non-operating retirement related credits of $53 million and the related tax impact on all of these items. It also excludes a net gain of $424 million for tax adjustments. The gain was a result of several tax settlements across various jurisdictions covering a multiyear period. The gain was partially offset by an additional provisional revaluation of the deferred tax assets due to U.S. tax reform and a $671 million tax indemnification. The tax indemnification amount is associated with our Tax Matters Agreement with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company since these tax settlements were based on pre-separation tax years. As a result, Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share, was $0.64. Turning to the segment, Personal Systems net revenue remained very strong, delivering $8.8 billion, up 14%. We are encouraged as the results continued to be broad-based reflecting execution against our strategy and an innovative product portfolio. By customer segment, consumer revenue was up 10% and commercial revenue was up 16%. By product category, revenue was up 15% for notebooks, up 16% for desktops and up 9% for workstation. Our disciplined focus on market segmentation enabled profitable share gain. Personal Systems operating profit dollars grew year-over-year and operating margin was 3.8%, up 60 basis points as we lack some of the largest commodity cost increases we saw last year. We will continue to balance pricing to adjust for the impacts of currency and commodity and logistics costs and other market dynamics. Turning to printing, revenue was $5.2 billion in the quarter, up 11%. We are pleased with this growth and are encouraged by the progress we are making integrating S-Print. Total hardware units were up 13% with consumer units up 4% and commercial units up 88%. Sequentially, commercial units were up 10%. In calendar Q1, overall print unit share was 42%, up 1 point year-over-year and up 4 points sequentially. Q2 supplies revenue of $3.4 billion was up 8% year-over-year or 6% in constant currency. The supplies mix of total print revenue was 65% and we continue to operate the lower ceiling for supplies channel inventory. We also had good momentum in our contractual offerings. We are pleased with the strong growth in Instant Ink, where we are growing our global subscriber base and in MPS, we continue to grow revenue. Print operating profit grew $19 million and operating margin was 16% in the quarter, down 1.3 points year-over-year, but up 20 basis points sequentially. The primary drivers of the year-over-year margin decline were strong unit placements and go-to-market investments largely as a result of adding S-Print. Additionally, we saw increased raw material cost in the quarter, which we expect to continue throughout the year. Now, turning to cash flow and capital allocation, Q2 cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion and free cash flow was $937 million. For the full year, we now expect free cash flow to be at least $3.7 billion. Cash conversion cycle was minus 30 days, improved 3 days sequentially driven by a 7-day increase in days payable outstanding offset by a 3 day increase in days sales outstanding and a 1 day increase in days of inventory. Increases in days of inventory and days payable outstanding are largely a result of negotiated payment terms and leveraging our balance sheet. Consistent with the cash priorities described in Q1 in connection with U.S. tax reform, we successfully completed a $1.85 billion debt tender during Q2. Additionally, we had capital returns of $801 million in share repurchases and $227 million in cash dividends. For the full year, we still expect to deliver returns toward the higher end of our long-term range of 50% to 75% of free cash flow. Before turning to guidance, I want to reiterate the importance of focusing on our cost structure. Because of the synergies we see in Print, including the result of the acquisition, combined with other cost efficiency opportunities, we will be expanding our current restructuring program. Compared to the high-end of our prior restructuring outlook, we expect the restructuring costs to increase by $150 million to $200 million. This includes both labor and non-labor related actions. We still expect to complete the plan by the end of fiscal 2019, including these incremental actions. We expect that the total gross annual run-rate savings before reinvestments to increase by at least $75 million over the higher end of the previously communicated range beginning in fiscal \u201820. Looking forward, keep the following in mind related to our financial outlook. In Personal Systems, we expect that logistic and overall component cost will continue to increase throughout FY \u201818. This headwind and any net impact on re-pricing will ultimately depend upon actual market demand, competitive dynamics and any impact from currency. In printing, we have began to see increases in raw material costs in Q2 and expect that pressure to continue during the second half. In addition, we expect to continue to have strong positive NPV unit placements, which should continue to push the hardware revenue mix higher. We will also continue to leverage our balance sheet if we see attractive economic opportunities to do so. For the full year, we expect to deliver our productivity initiatives as guided at SAM. We are also updating the way we estimate our quarterly non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better visibility across quarterly reporting periods. Going forward, we\u2019ll report our non-GAAP earnings incorporating a 16% tax rate calculated using long-term non-GAAP financial projections. The non-GAAP tax rate is based on our financial forecast and all currently available information and maybe subject to change for a variety of impacts, including the company\u2019s ongoing analysis of the tax act over the measurement period, the rapidly changing global tax environment or other changes to the company\u2019s strategy or business operations. Additionally, we would expect our cash tax rate to be 16% plus or minus 2% for the full year. With all that in mind, we expect Q3 \u201818 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, is in the range of $0.49 to $0.52. Q3 \u201818 GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.47 to $0.51. We are raising our full year fiscal \u201818 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.97 to $2.02 and our full year fiscal \u201818 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.82. With that, let\u2019s open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today will be Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead. Steve Milunovich : Thank you and congratulations to you Cathie and Steve. Cathie, do you expect the printer margin to rise sequentially through the next two quarters or whether that will be offset by the higher raw material costs and higher unit placements? And specifically what raw material costs are you referring to that are going up? Cathie Lesjak : Sure. So, in terms of the raw material costs what we are really seeing is increases in resin, plastics as well as DRAM, because there is DRAM also in the printer. Resins and plastics are largely up as a result of oil prices increasing. So that\u2019s where what we are seeing there. In terms of how to think about the OP rate over time, we don\u2019t really have an explicit rate for operating profit for print in any particular period. We do long-term expect that the margins will be 16% to 18%, which we talked about at SAM, which was pretty consistent with what we have seen historically. When you think about the progress in the, I would say, near to mid-term the way to think about it is as we integrate S-Print, ramp the A3 business as well as the 3D business and execute on our productivity initiatives, we do expect that the margins will improve from the 16%, but that\u2019s really a kind of a mid-term kind of comment. Steve Milunovich : Okay. And could you update us in terms of the buyback, I am not sure last quarter you were at that point ready to talk about the use of repatriated cash and so forth? Cathie Lesjak : So in the first half, we repurchased shares for a total price of about $1.3 billion. In the second quarter, we did about 800 million of share repurchases, which is higher than what we have typically done. When we look forward to the rest of the year, we will be active in the market, but the second half will really be consistent with our capital return priorities. So, we have talked about the fact that we are going to be towards the higher end of 50% to 75% of our free cash flow this year and our buying in the second half will be consistent with that. And keep in mind that, that towards the higher end of 50% to 75% applies to now the increased free cash flow of at least $3.7 billion for the year. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Paul Coster : Yes, thanks for taking my questions. So, I will move it to one if I may. Cathie, if you can just give us some sense of what the organic versus the acquired growth rate for the printer business was that would be helpful? And Dion, I guess we are seeing some potentially transformative consolidation taking place in the printer industry, arguably part of the end game, it must be trying for opportunities and risks. Can you just talk to us about what the near-term tactical opportunities might be given some of the strategic uncertainty amongst the two players? And also how it\u2019s changing your view of what HP will do during this end game? Cathie Lesjak : So, why don\u2019t I start? Paul, as we talked about, I think it was last quarter or maybe even the quarter before, we are integrating the S-Print business into the core HP print business frankly as fast as we can. And the reason for that is that it\u2019s going to drive shareholder value. So as a result of doing that, there isn\u2019t really a way to meaningfully separate what is organic growth versus inorganic growth for the Print segment. I think the best way to think about it is that Print by all means has had a very strong first half in terms of performing. We are very pleased with the top line growth as well as the unit placements, the margin expansion and frankly the supplies revenue growth as well. Dion Weisler : And thanks Paul for the question, the print industry is no different to the Personal Systems industry. I think we have seen the Personal Systems industry consolidating over many years and it\u2019s still consolidating today and we are able to continue to grow in the Personal Systems businesses as you\u2019ve seen us do double-digits for the past six quarters by playing our own game. And I think the Print business is no different. There is not room in an essentially flat market for 14 players. And so I think naturally over time that market will consolidate as well, but I don\u2019t subscribe to the fact that it has to be done through acquisition. I think we made a very strategic execution of the Samsung print business that was a technology acquisition as well as an acquisition of some incredibly talented people, but it wasn\u2019t a market share play. As we look at the market today, we feel that from a technology perspective we are very well positioned in both ink as well as laser in A4 as well as A3 and we continue to move towards a service-orientated business. And so by adding the sprinkles of magic that we do across the portfolio, I expect that we can outpace the market. Having said all of that, I have always said that M&A is an important part of our strategy that we wouldn\u2019t surprise anybody, any of our investors or the industry with what we would do that. When we do think about M&A, it would leave somewhere on our strategy page and would need to bolster our strategic intent and accelerate our strategy that it will be returns based and it would be weighted against other organic options and alternative uses of cash that it would come at a reasonable cost and be modest in size and that we\u2019ll remain thoughtful and disciplined and ensure that the opportunities are compelling and will maximize shareholder value. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sherri Scribner : Hi, thank you. Cathie, you mentioned the operating expenses were up a little bit sequentially related to the S-Print acquisition. Can you maybe help us think about how operating margins will trend now that Samsung is in the business? Should we seem operating expenses at these levels or do you expect to be able to bring operating expenses down somewhat as we move through the year based on the cost-cutting initiatives? Cathie Lesjak : Sure. So, Sherri, what I actually said was the OpEx is up largely as a result of S-Print, but not exclusively. We are also \u2013 we have made incremental investments in R&D and go-to-market as well and I believe that those will continue. Now, clearly when you look at either the total company or specifically the print business, our S-Print business has been in investment node in the first half. And as we talked about at the total company level that it would be accretive by about $0.01 in the full year. So, we do expect it to shift to making some money, which is always good. But keep in mind that even as it makes the money, it\u2019s going to be dilutive to operating margin rates. I think that, that\u2019s very important when you think about the trajectory of the print operating margin rate in fiscal \u201818. Sherri Scribner : Okay, great. Thank you. And then just looking at the supplies business, it\u2019s trending very strongly and clearly you have turned that segment around, how should we think about growth in Supplies, I think we have talked about kind of flat maybe slight growth this year, I know there is some inorganic pieces in there, but it seems like you are trending well ahead of that supplies? Cathie Lesjak : So, Sherri, what we expect that kind of the sum of Q2, Q3 and Q4 on a year-over-year basis that we would say see 5% to 7% growth in constant currency. That\u2019s what we expect for FY \u201818. For FY \u201819 we expect that supplies will be flat to slightly up. Once we have an apples and apples comparison with S-Print in both years. Sherri Scribner : And our next questioner today will be Toni Sacconaghi was Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you and congratulations Cathie on your tenure and all best wishes for the future. Cathie Lesjak : Thank you. Toni Sacconaghi : I have a question and a follow-up please. First on PCs, ASPs were up about 7% year-over-year and we have seen real strength in ASPs for the last several quarters. Perhaps you can help us understand how much of it you think is coming from DRAM versus changes in your mix like gaming and accordingly sort of how sustainable once DRAM starts declining, how sustainable are ASP increases in PCs going forward or what\u2019s sort of the right way to think about ASP changes in a more normalized environment? And I have a follow-up please. Cathie Lesjak : So Tony, we saw good progress as you mentioned in ASPs both year-over-year as well as sequentially. And in both cases, the positive mix shift that we are driving into premium is having a significant impact on the ASPs and we believe that those will continue to be the case. We also saw as you mentioned we definitely saw some help from DRAM pricing or pricing that we took as a result of commodity cost increases. And depending on what happens to commodity costs that piece will obviously go up or down. And then from a foreign exchange perspective also with the tougher dollar, we could see some ASP increases as a result of currency as well. Toni Sacconaghi : But was the impact from mix greater than the impact from price from DRAM and I will ask my follow-up, just on supplies back to printer supplies, I think last quarter you had said that the contribution from S-Print was about 6 points and I know it\u2019s become more monies now, but would it be fair to sort of assume that the contribution from S-Sprint was sort of in that vicinity this quarter and were there any changes to your channel inventory? I think you said you were under your ceiling, but it\u2019s a little bit of a different commentary from prior quarters where I think you said you were within your range. So just the follow-up on the ASPs and then supplies please? Thank you. Cathie Lesjak : Sure. The impact of mix on ASPs was material and greater than the pricing impact. In terms of supplies, I will go back to what I said earlier, we really have integrated the business here. So, it\u2019s really not \u2013 we are really not able to meaningfully determine what was S-Print\u2019s contribution to supplies versus the core, because we are rationalizing SKUs, we are now selling more HP SKUs than S-Print SKUs and therefore are those supplies S-Print supplies or are they HP supplies. So it\u2019s just gotten. It\u2019s not just gotten money, it\u2019s just well-integrated, which is exactly what you want us to do, because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive the value. In terms of the channel inventory, I think we changed our commentary I want to say two or three quarters ago, when we really now are managing below a ceiling and we have been consistently below the ceiling for supplies frankly since we made the change to our supply sales model. Dion Weisler : And Toni, I think we have consistently said and you and I have talked about it, we have this relentless focus on execution and we have a continued confidence in their predictive value of the full box model, where you can expect us to drive continued improvements across all full boxes to maintain supply stabilization in \u201819. We anticipate the headwinds that Cathie mentioned earlier. We have contemplated them. We have captured them in the expectations and we have guided that for the rest of \u201818 as well as \u201819. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Thank you, Cathie. My congratulations as well. I have two questions, I will just ask them together. First of all, can you bridge the $0.05 guidance increase on EPS from roughly $1.95 to $2 at the midpoint? And then secondly from a free cash flow perspective, if you look at the last couple of years over half of free cash flow came in the back half of the year, which would suggest that you could do $4 billion plus this year, why is seasonality different this year versus the past couple of years? Cathie Lesjak : So, Katy since it\u2019s my last call, I think I am going to say if I give an inch you take a mile, I am just on the free cash flow. So, when we look at the first half free cash flow, we are very pleased with the performance. It\u2019s really based on the strength primarily of Personal Systems to use Dion\u2019s term a double-double and a double-double is pretty significant from a timing perspective to cash flow given the negative cash conversion cycle of Personal Systems. We expect Personal Systems to do well in the second half although compares are getting increasingly difficult. So I think that\u2019s one piece. The other piece is that in the first half we did have some one-time positive cash flow items that won\u2019t repeat themselves. And then when you think about the bridge for the $0.05 increase that you talked about, it\u2019s largely as a result of the share repurchases that we did in Q2 that were in excess of what we had originally expected when we provided the guide. So, you have got the follow-on effect of that as well as obviously the share repurchases that we are going to do in the second half consistent with returning towards the high-end of the 50% to 75% of our free cash flow. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. And I echo the congrats, Cathie. I hope you get to take a nice long vacation sometime in 2019. Dion Weisler : Thanks for saying that, Shannon in 2019. Shannon Cross : As I say but not before that. Dion Weisler : Exactly. Cathie Lesjak : I have got a lot to do, I am not going anywhere. Shannon Cross : In terms of the 3D print business, Dion, maybe you can talk a bit about what you are hearing from customers, how you are seeing the ramp, I know you have a few new products that will be coming out this year, so just curious as to how it\u2019s progressing in line or ahead of your expectations? Dion Weisler : Yes. Look, I am really excited about the leadership position we have taken in 3D printing and the segment where we operate in a very short period of time, we are on the path towards disrupting this $12 trillion global manufacturing industry. But it\u2019s a long path, I have always said this is a 5 to 10-year journey and we are making the investments today to really secure shareholder value both today and for the future we are seeing significant sales momentum, including repeat orders from customers as well as service bureaus. We are expanding our adoption across key verticals. We are seeing more than 50% of the customer benchmarks. So these are when a customer is contemplating buying 3D printing they will give us a file and they say can you make this path for us who want to see and test this path. And we are of course checking what that path is for and then 50% of the cases therefore production applications, which is really what differentiates us with this technology. And some of the recent highlights, Forecast 3D, one of the oldest and largest 3D manufacturers in the U.S. has expanded its Multi Jet Fusion footprint. It\u2019s upgrading its entire fleet to our 4210 solutions and as they respond to the growing demand, they are expecting to produce millions of parts on Multi Jet Fusion in the coming year. Jabil, one of the largest contract manufacturers is now deploying Multi Jet Fusion in the U.S. and Asia as part of its distributor manufacturing strategy. And this quarter, we also continue to grow unit placement across all verticals and geographies, including new customers in the automotive and electronics industry. And we officially announced our market entry into Mexico as well. So stay tuned this is a great business for the long-term. We remain really confident. Shannon Cross : Thank you. And then Cathie, I had a follow-up on cash flow, from like I know I think it\u2019s going to probably kick you if I ask this, but from a 50,000 foot level, this year obviously cash flow has been up year-over-year or should be and so how do we think about it from sort of recurring going forward? Obviously, PCs play into it, but when we think about more sort of the recurring level of cash flow, it should come off the model maybe you could talk about puts and takes that happened this year that will or will not repeat? Cathie Lesjak : Sure. Actually, thank you for the question. I probably should have mentioned this when we were talking about cash flow. Over time, free cash flow basically grows in line with earnings. And so we do get a timing benefit when Personal Systems has a particularly strong growth sequentially, because of course it has a negative cash conversion cycle, but over time, the cash flow that it generates is going to be largely, its profit. And so there is a pull-in for cash. And so over the long-term you should really think about free cash flow being in line with earnings. Operator : Our next questioner today will be Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. Congrats to you Cathie from me as well. Your margins have been pretty robust despite these commodity headwinds. Can you just talk about the commodity environment in terms of memory both DRAM and NAND I think you said that some commodities will be a headwind, but how have they changed relative to your expectation from last quarter or are you seeing any impact from extended lead times in some items like passive? And I have a follow-up for Dion. Cathie Lesjak : Wamsi, we have seen an increase in commodity costs. If you think about going back to our security analyst meeting, we actually thought it was going to flatten out in Q4 of last year or towards the end of Q4 of last year. So, we have seen an increase that at that time we had not expected. But as important as commodity costs are as well as by the way the logistics costs are also going up a bit, it\u2019s really about how you respond. What are the tools at your disposal to figure out how you mitigate those types of increases and this team has just done a tremendous job at mitigating and managing in that environment. In fact, I put my money on them in a tough commodity environment. So think about it we have used things like pricing, we have used our supply chain scale, we have leveraged our balance sheet and then to go back to Toni\u2019s question we have done a great job of driving positive mix. And so those are the types of things that we will continue to use to kind of manage this tough environment. And I have every confidence that we will continue to be successful. Wamsi Mohan : Okay, thanks Cathie. And Dion, as a follow-up to the question on the strategic changes that are happening, can you talk about the opportunity if you are seeing any that has been created for HP, particularly in managed print services and in the copier space given some of the events at Xerox and can you give an update on your Ink in the Office initiative as well? Thank you. Dion Weisler : Sure. Look, the way I think about change in the marketplace is that change equals opportunity and so whilst these competitors that are distracted with structure and that generally presents an opportunity in the marketplace. So what we are doing is doubling down and playing our own game. If we are out in front of a customer making a call and our competitors are gathered around the water fountain, then we are out in front of the customer and that\u2019s really where we want to be spending our time. I think we have incredible assets inside the organization. We are very focused on managed print services. There is no doubt the business model is shifting even in the traditional A4 space. It\u2019s moving from transactional to contractual that\u2019s happening at a different price in every country, but it is a mega-trend that we certainly want to be out in front of managed print services, we have been doing now for many years. And I think we have really mastered the art of how to manage this for a customer and the pipeline not only for managed print services, but device-as-a-service is really strong, so PC-as-a-service and increasingly customers are looking to have everything both at Print and Personal Systems and workstations and even 3D printing in the future as a service. So we remain focused on that. With regards to Ink in the Office, it\u2019s an important part of our overall strategy. We have two incredible technology platforms. We have an ink-based platform and we have a laser-based platform. And as we talk to a customer, we don\u2019t sell them a technology, we understand what their needs are and inside a customer, every department, every user has an individual need. So the marketing department is going to want laser-based quality. They are going to be wanting really vibrant color when they print proposals, as same with sales inside Cathie and now Steve\u2019s organization. They are a little more frugal and so they want to be able to see red and black, but we would like to see green on headlights, that\u2019s good too, but it doesn\u2019t require the same high-quality, you get incredible quality with ink, but just not that glossy kind of quality. And so that represents a really unique solution. That means that when we go to a customer we can provide this mix of hybrid solutions down to a departmental and individual basis that makes our offerings very unique and compelling. So that\u2019s what we are focused on playing our game. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Yes, thank you. Congrats on mine as well to you, Cathie. I guess two questions. First one when I think about the commentary you guys have on supplies for next year being, I think flat to slightly up? I understand you don\u2019t want to breakdown the delta or kind of breakdown the delta between HP and S-Print, but the supplies commentary would suggest that your installed base is perhaps declining at a faster rate today post S-Print versus what it was before? Is that a fair assumption to take away from your commentary for supplies in fiscal \u201819 and if so when do you see the installed base starting to normalize as you go forward? Cathie Lesjak : Amit, the core HP installed base, I don\u2019t think is declining at a faster rate, but clearly, the S-Print portfolio will decline at a faster rate and part of that\u2019s because of that nature of the units that S-Print put into the markets, but also because we have rationalized SKUs and that\u2019s why it\u2019s not meaningful to talk about S-Print separately from HP, because they are one in the same, the better job we do at integrating, the better value for our investors and the fact to the matter is you can\u2019t separate the two. Amit Daryanani : Got it. I guess maybe I am trying to get a sense of when do you think the combined installed base starts to normalize and have the same trajectory that maybe HP did a year ago? And maybe just my follow-up by the way, how do you think about FX within your guidance for the full year given the fact you have had some fairly volatile consumables as of late? Cathie Lesjak : So, I think I take you back to the security analyst meeting, where we talked about kind of what we thought was going to happen at the home, the office and the graphics level in terms of the four-box model. I think that\u2019s probably the place to go. So, from a home perspective, we did expect that the installed base would continue to decline, that from an office prospective we thought the installed base with the addition of A3 would be flat, and that from a graphics prospective we thought the installed base would be up. And that gives you a sense of what\u2019s happening from an installed base, our expectations from an installed base perspective. Dion Weisler : I think we continue to successfully execute those growth initiatives, but it takes time and we had certainly expected it to take time as we enter into a new $55 billion business, the A3 business, where we have very low market share, we know that it is going to take time to develop that business, but we remain really confident that we will achieve the 12% market share that we set out to achieve by 2020. Cathie Lesjak : And I think it\u2019s important when we talk about S-Print that you separate the A3 business which was a very small part of the Samsung print business. It was really all about the future technology that future with their technology and it\u2019s the A4 piece of the S-Print business that we talk about on the installed base coming down pretty significantly and to Dion\u2019s point as expected. Amit Daryanani : And you might want to answer the second question on FX? Cathie Lesjak : I am sorry can you remind me the question on FX? Amit Daryanani : Yes, Cathie. I was just trying to get a sense on how you think about FX and the impact of FX, which has been fairly volatile baked into your July guidance for the full year guide? Cathie Lesjak : Sure. So FX has been very unpredictable and when we think about where the dollar is trading today, we think about revenue kind of the impact of revenue as a result of FX for the total year would be approximately 2 points and obviously most of that impact \u2013 the vast majority of that impact was happening in the first half. Operator : And the last questioner for today will be Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you very much and Cathie you will be missed and the great results and outlook. My question is Cathie, [Technical Difficulty] investment into the Print business. Can you specify was that equal amongst S-Print and your core typical prints or more on the graphics side or the 3D print side, the supply side and maybe allocate \u2013 maybe just talk about where these incremental investments are being allocated? Thank you. Cathie Lesjak : So, Jim, the biggest impact to FX was the addition of S-Print in the portfolio from a year-over-year perspective. But as I mentioned, we did make incremental investments in R&D and go-to-market and those are along the initiatives that frankly we have been talking about now for several quarters in A3 figures prominently in that, especially along the go-to-market lines. In terms of the specifics of how much is in the core, in the A3 space, S-Print, graphics, we don\u2019t typically go into that level of detail, but I would say that you think about the initiatives that we have for growth and that\u2019s going to help drive you to where the OpEx investments are being made. Jim Suva : Great. Thanks so much for the clarification and detail. Dion Weisler : Great. Well, thank you. We are at the top of the hour. I\u2019d like to reiterate that that I am very pleased with the results of the quarter, but as always, there is more work to do. We never stop. We remain confident in our strategy and our ability to grow. Our reinvention is paying off. And I believe our best is yet to come. And finally, I again want to thank Cathie for her incredible partnership and I look forward to having Steve here on the call next quarter and to speak to you all then. Thanks so much. Operator : And the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Quarter 3 was another strong quarter of profitable growth with consistent and balanced performance across businesses and regions. As a company, we're delivering what we said we would do and optimizing the business to consistently deliver long-term sustainable and profitable growth.  Q3 was impressive. Specifically, we delivered 12% revenue growth, adding $1.5 billion to the top line, and we increased non-GAAP earnings per share 21% to $0.52. And we delivered $1.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and returned $900 million to shareholders, bringing the total return of cash to shareholders so far this year to $2.6 billion.  Each quarter is an opportunity for us to strike the right balance in how we plan, innovate and deliver operational performance regardless of market conditions, external factors and competitor movements. We are continuing to grow in our core with profitable share, advance our position in our growth segments and invest in future categories where we can disrupt with innovation and new business models. And just as importantly, we're laser-focused on increasing productivity and taking cost out of the business. As I've been clear about, our goal is to consistently deliver on our financial commitments while executing our strategic framework. We do this by playing our own game and winning the right way and by delivering products and services that are consistently engineered to amaze our partners and customers.  Now let me take you through what we're seeing across the business. First, let's start with Personal Systems, where profitable growth continues to be our priority. It was another strong quarter with operating profit dollars, margins and revenue each growing sequentially and versus the prior year. HP continued to outperform the PC market in the second calendar quarter, growing share with broad-based growth across regions and product categories. While we're proud of these results and the team's efforts, share gains continue to be an outcome of our innovation for customers and not an objective of our business. We are delivering differentiated products and experiences to the market. We continue to reinvent our Personal Systems business and portfolio with the most secure and manageable PCs. In May, we unveiled a bold new lineup of premium notebooks, desktops and displays across our Elite and ENVY portfolios, including the world's smallest business convertible and the first detachable with integrated privacy screen. The team is leveraging HP's design and engineering leadership to deliver the ultimate combination of style, performance and versatility, what I like to call our sprinkles of magic. Our premium pipeline remains strong, and we're excited about a range of new products that will be hitting the market as we head into the holiday season. Similarly, in vertical markets, we continue to drive innovation and growth.  In gaming, we enhanced our OMEN brand with a new portfolio of industry-leading accessories. Our newest OMEN laptop that launched in May at a gaming festival in Beijing sold out in just 20 minutes on JD.com. And OMEN was front and center at last month's Overwatch League Grand Finals that attracted more than 10 million viewers across streaming platforms.  In retail, we introduced the new HP Engage retail point-of-sale portfolio, providing retailers with a versatile platform with layers of security to enable seamless engagement from the moment consumers enter a store until the time they check out. Our new retail solutions will also be available through the HP Device-as-a-Service offering.  Just like Personal Systems, the Print business continues to make steady progress and deliver profitable growth. Total Print revenue was up an impressive 11% with growth in all regions and across Commercial hardware, Consumer hardware and Supplies. Print units were up 12%, and the overall print hardware market grew 1% in the second calendar quarter, supporting our confidence in the health of the Printing business for the long term.  The Print team not only continues to execute our strategy and innovate across the portfolio but is making progress in strategically shifting towards contractual business models. Over the past few quarters, we've expanded upon our acquisition of Samsung's printer business and extended our A3 product portfolio to offer customers affordable color printing while delivering best-in-class performance and security.  We are building on this foundation of strong technology with differentiated solutions to expand Managed Print Services and with the investments in our direct and indirect go-to-market capabilities, including the selective acquisition of office equipment dealers or OEDs, that provide access to increased profit pools from higher-margin services.  Earlier this month, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Apogee Corporation. Apogee is Europe's largest independent provider of print and document services and has a proven track record and deep capabilities in contractual sales. This is an important next step in our strategy to accelerate growth in the contractual office print market. Following the announcement of the transaction, I met with a number of our large partners who understand that scaling our contractual business faster benefits both HP and our partners to grow in the industry shift to contractual.  Looking at our other strategic initiatives. In graphics, we again grew revenue and are driving market-leading innovation. This quarter, we unveiled the new DesignJet Z large format photo printers that offer amazing image quality and production efficiency. We also announced that R.R. Donnelley is adding the new HP Indigo presses to their fleet to help increase their capacity and enhance their ability to deliver high-quality print products to their customers.  Shifting to the 3D Printing business, we are pleased with our progress in accelerating 3D printing for production manufacturing. We drove installations with industrial-grade customers, including the new 3D printing center in China, the world's largest manufacturing market. We are encouraged by the increasingly wide array of final part applications across sectors, including the industrial, consumer, auto and health care markets. We're seeing north of 50% of the parts produced on our systems are for final production.  This quarter, we also furthered our channel presence and expanded our strategic partnership with Siemens, providing design software support for our full-color platform. Ensuring the world's industrial product engineers have integrated design tools for 3D production is a critical enabler for market expansion. We are still in the very early stages of this business but remain excited and optimistic with our ability to disrupt the $12 trillion global manufacturing market. Before I move off 3D Printing, I'd like to share some additional news with you. After 37 years at HP, Stephen Nigro, President of our 3D Printing business, has made the decision to retire in early 2019. During the past 3 decades, Stephen has had a tremendous career from pioneering our first Inkjet printers to leading teams across the U.S. and Asia to most recently turning a nascent 3D printing opportunity into a business that has become the #1 commercial-grade plastics 3D printing vendor less than 2 years after product launch. Our differentiated 3D printing technology and leadership will help enable HP to accelerate the Fourth Industrial Revolution. I couldn't be more thankful for Steve's leadership, guidance and commitment to HP.  One of the things we pride ourselves on is the depth and breadth of our bench and our rigorous succession planning. I am super excited that Christoph Schell, our current President of the Americas region, will transition to become President of 3D Printing, where he and the team will focus on the next phase of scaling our 3D Printing business. Christoph just celebrated his 20th year anniversary at HP, and he's a rigorous and balanced operational leader with outstanding experience transitioning customers and partners into new service-led business models. Under his leadership, our Americas region has delivered impressive and consistent growth. Christoph has a passion for 3D Printing and has played a key role in our earliest 3D Printing wins and partnerships. I have great confidence in his leadership of this important business. We expect the transition to be seamless and look forward to having you all meet Christoph at our Security Analyst Meeting in New York on October 3. Christoph's role is effective November 1.  In summary, Q3 was another strong quarter of profitable growth with balanced growth across businesses and regions. We are pleased with the success in the business.  Looking ahead to Q4, we are monitoring several evolving market dynamics, including the global trade environment, currency volatility and industry component availability. That said, one of the strengths we've consistently demonstrated is our ability to navigate the impact of these challenges and leverage our innovation and scale to create advantage and drive sustained performance. We are executing and meeting our commitments, and I'm confident in the team's ability to continue doing exactly this.  With that, I'll hand it over to Steve to cover our financial results in more detail and share our financial outlook. Steven Fieler : Thanks, Dion. Q3 was another quarter where we delivered strong results consistent with our strategy and furthering our goal of creating long-term shareholder value. Having met recently with a large number of employees, customers and partners, it's clear that this company remains focused on executing each quarter while also positioning the company for the future. And our results demonstrate this balance of delivering in the near term while investing in growth and leading through an increasingly dynamic environment.  We continue to post growth in revenue and operating profit dollars across both segments and earnings per share. We also generated strong free cash flow in the quarter and are on track to return capital to shareholders above the high end of our range of 50% to 75%. Similar to prior quarters, I'll walk through our financial details : first, the P&L, including the segments; then the balance sheet; cash flow and capital return; and finally, guidance.  Starting at the top line, net revenue was $14.6 billion, up 12% or up 9% in constant currency. Our performance remained strong across businesses and geographies. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas grew 6%. EMEA was up 10%, and APJ grew 13%. Gross margin was 18.4%, down 20 basis points year-over-year, primarily resulting from the addition of S-Print. Sequentially, gross margin was down 90 basis points, driven by seasonal mix.  Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.6 billion were up 15%. This increase, which is similar to the growth in prior periods, was driven by the addition of S-Print along with incremental R&D and go-to-market investments to support growth. Sequentially, operating expenses declined 2%. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $59 million for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.52, up $0.09 or 21% year-over-year with a diluted share count of approximately 1.6 billion shares.  Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes amortization and tangible assets of $20 million, acquisition-related charges of $10 million and other GAAP-only charges totaling $11 million, offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $56 million and related tax impact on all of these items. As a result, Q3 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.54. At the  segment level, Personal Systems net revenue remained strong, delivering $9.4 billion, up 12%. Results continue to be broad-based across customer segments, geographies and products, reflecting the strength of our supply chain, go to market and innovative product portfolio.  By customer segment, Consumer revenue was up 10% and Commercial revenue was up 13%. By product category, revenue was up 13% for Notebooks, up 12% for Desktops and up 11% for Workstations.  In calendar Quarter 2, we saw opportunity for profitable growth and we took advantage. We outgrew the market by 5.4 points and earned market share of 24%, doing so while managing cost headwinds and investing in innovation.  Personal Systems continue to grow operating profit, up $52 million versus last year. We also improved operating margin to 3.9%, up 20 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points sequentially. The increase was primarily driven by higher ASPs due to both favorable currency and improved mix, partially offset by higher commodity and logistics costs.  In Printing, revenue was $5.2 billion in the quarter, up 11%. We have made steady progress in the performance of the business and remain focused on managing the portfolio across the core growth and future product categories. Total hardware units were up 12%, with Consumer units up 2% and Commercial units up 91%, including S-Print, and up 3% sequentially. In calendar Quarter 2, overall Print unit share was 43%, up 1 point year-over-year. We continue to take advantage of opportunities to place units when we see them.  Q3 Supplies revenue of $3.4 billion was up 8% or 6% in constant currency. The Supplies mix of total Print revenue was 66%, down year-over-year and nearly flat sequentially. And we continue to operate below our ceilings for Supplies channel inventory.  Print operating profit grew $25 million year-over-year, and operating margin was 16%, down 1.3 points year-over-year and flat sequentially. The primary drivers of the year-over-year margin decline were the addition of S-Print and the strong unit placements and investments in growth and future initiatives, including A3 and 3D printing.  Additionally, as expected, we experienced increased raw material cost in the quarter, which should remain elevated in Q4. We continue to see momentum in our contractual offerings. Our recent announcement to acquire Apogee builds on our long-term contractual strategy by expanding our ability to deliver value-added services and accelerates the deployment of our technology into the growing contractual market. We expect the transaction to close by the end of the calendar year 2018 pending regulatory review and other customary closing conditions. We expect the deal to be accretive by approximately $0.01 on a non-GAAP basis in the first full year after close.  Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Q3 cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion and free cash flow was $1.4 billion. Cash conversion cycle improved 4 days sequentially to minus 34 days, driven by a 4-day increase in days payable outstanding, a 2-day decrease in days sales outstanding offset by a 2-day increase in days of inventory. Increases in days of inventory and days payable outstanding are largely a result of leveraging our balance sheet and normal seasonality.  We had capital returns of $696 million in share repurchases and $223 million in cash dividends in Q3. For the full year, it is now more likely that we will deliver returns above the high end of our FY '18 outlook of 50% to 75% of free cash flow. Looking forward to Q4, keep the following in mind related to our financial outlook. In Personal Systems, we expect that the overall basket of components and logistics costs will remain stable to Q3 levels. In Printing, we expect strong unit placements, which should continue to push the hardware revenue mix higher. We've recently seen increased currency volatility, and we'll work to mitigate the impact via prior hedges and potential pricing actions, considering the full spectrum of market and demand dynamics.  For the full year, we expect to deliver our productivity initiatives. We'll also continue to leverage our balance sheet if we see attractive economic opportunities to do so. Finally, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate, which is based on our long-term non-GAAP financial projection, to be 16% in Q4.  With all that in mind, we expect Q4 '18 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.52 to $0.55. Q4 '18 GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.48 to $0.51. We are raising our full year fiscal 2018 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2 to $2.03 and our full year fiscal '18 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.82 to $2.85. I look forward to engaging directly with many of you at the upcoming conferences and meetings as well as at our upcoming Security Analyst Meeting on October 3.  With that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first questioner today will be Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Huberty : What was your market share in A3 during the quarter? And how are you thinking about the acquisition of Apogee and potentially other acquisitions in the distribution space in terms of what that could add to your A3 market share over time? And then I have a follow up on inventory. Dion Weisler : Thanks, Katy, and thanks for the question. Specifically, we grew share 2 points in the quarter to 9.1% in calendar Quarter 2., and we remain excited about our future opportunities. While I'm pleased with that performance and I'm encouraged by our progress that our team is making around our A3 business, we don't expect that kind of growth each quarter. We're -- as I'd like to always remind everybody, we're building a business for the long term. We're playing our own game. Our focus, as in all our areas of our business, is on profitable gains over time. We remain on track to achieve the 12% market share by the end of calendar 2020, and that guidance remains intact. As it relates to Apogee, our goal of 12% worldwide market share by the end of calendar 2020 is not materially impacted by this acquisition given its size relative to the worldwide total available market of A3. That being said, the Apogee transaction is all about giving access to new profit pools by expanding our ability to deliver value-added services and the acceleration of the deployment of our -- of what we assure is superior technology into the growing contractual spaces, especially amongst SMBs. Kathryn Huberty : And then... Steven Fieler : Katy, could I have the opportunity even... Kathryn Huberty : Yes, sure. Steven Fieler : In my prior role as Treasurer to be part of the -- leading the initial negotiation with Apogee, it really is about services capabilities. They've got a great leadership team and winning in their market. We definitely took a disciplined approach for that particular deal as we would for any other deal in that space and believe we've got a great opportunity to create shareholder value. In my prepared remarks, I talked about the $0.01 accretion, but we also like the margin profile. There have been double-digit EBITDA margins for some time, and they play in a fast kind of growing part of the contractual TAM. So we think we've got the opportunity to generate synergies over time with this deal. They've been very successful both organically and inorganically and really give us the opportunity to place more units over time as well as to leverage the platform [ they ] build for Device as a Service and other services capabilities we're building internally. Kathryn Huberty : And Steve, maybe a follow up for you. I was surprised to see inventory up as much as it was sequentially just given that you made some pretty big pre-buys over the last couple of years to deal with the tighter memory environment. That's now loosening. And so what's driving the inventory higher at the moment? Steven Fieler : Our inventory was up $500 million quarter-to-quarter, up 2 days. We feel comfortable what we're doing in inventory. We are leveraging our balance sheet. We're seeing higher sea and in-transit shipments. And it's generally in support of the growth in our Personal Systems business and to a less extent, in Print. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : I guess, my first question is for Dion. During the commentary, you mentioned the contractual market several times around the acquisition and then in some of the other areas in Print, but you've been offering Managed Print Services for many years. So I'm kind of curious if something has changed there in terms of how you're looking at it or if it's just the inclusion of A3. And then within contractual, sort of recurring revenue models, I'm also wondering what you're seeing in terms of DaaS for PCs. And I have a follow-up. Dion Weisler : Thanks, Shannon. Indeed, we're seeing increased demand from customers in their quest to move from a transactional relationship to a much deeper contractual relationship. And of course, the acquisition of the Samsung S-Print business was designed to give us access to a complete range of A3 products, which largely play in that they're almost exclusively contractual in nature. And that provides us an opportunity to tap into the $55 billion A3 market, which is, again, largely contractual. What, I guess, I'm alluding to in my prepared remarks is it's not just A3 that is contractual. It's also A4 that's moving into contractual, and a customer often has a mix of both A3 and A4. So largely, we're starting to think about the business and our customers through the lens of transactional and contractual. The Apogee acquisition was obviously designed, and the strategic rationale was to tap into this growing trend towards contractual. For those of you who are not familiar with Apogee, they are the largest independent print and document service provider in Europe. And they've got a really proven track record, as Steve alluded to, for growth and a deep set of capabilities in the contractual space. So with Apogee, we're going to gain access to new profit pools by expanding our ability to deliver value-added services and accelerate the deployment of our technology into this growing contractual office printing market, especially amongst SMBs. And it really augments the 3 existing go-to-market motions that we have, the direct motion, the traditional IT channels motion that we've had for the longest time. And now with us getting into A3s, we're more and more working with these office equipment dealers or OEDs. And we were underrepresented in OEDs, and Apogee is squarely in the space. And they enhance our ability to deliver the solutions and services necessary to win in this market. Shannon Cross : Okay, great. And then, Steve, can you talk a bit about cash flow? Clearly, it's strong, continues to -- you continue to overachieve in terms of cash flow and [ helped deliver] [indiscernible] billion at least. And so I'm curious when you look at cash flow this year -- and I know you're not going to give guidance for next year, but just how should we sort of think about recurring versus nonrecurring and whether there may be some puts and takes in the model both for the next quarter or so and then looking forward? Steven Fieler : Sure. Thanks, Shannon. I think at the simplest level, we do expect that our free cash flow will grow in line with earnings over time. And so when I do reflect upon our performance year-to-date at $3.3 billion, we are growing free cash flow ahead of earnings. And that is on the strength of our Personal Systems volume and the negative cash conversion cycle that it drives. In Q3 specifically, which helped the year-to-date performance, we did have an improvement in our cash conversion cycle to minus 34 days, and so that was a benefit to our cash flow. When I think about the full year, similar to last year, we would expect that our cash conversion cycle would align more closely to what we described at SAM, which was a minus 29 to minus 30 days. And that's why the at least $3.7 billion, we think, is a prudent guide. But to sort of get to the meat of the question, when you're thinking about our cash flow, I would think about it very consistent to our earnings and earnings growth over time. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : I'm wondering why you didn't see more operating profit leverage in the quarter. You did have higher volume and revenues. You have a cost takeout program in place, and particularly with Samsung, you were expecting to have more cost takeout as the year progressed. And yes, you were aggressive in placing units, but your printer unit growth was pretty similar to the last 2 quarters. So why do you feel you didn't see more operating profit leverage this quarter? And then I have a follow-up, please. Steven Fieler : Yes. I'll take that one, Toni. So I would say our results and performance are really in line with the strategy and in essence, what we said we would do. We are delivering today and building for the future across our core growth and future categories. We are driving incremental operating profit dollars and earnings per share up $0.09 year-over-year. To specifically address your question, when I look at the year-over-year performance, our Personal Systems business did add about $1 billion of revenue and they did have op margin expansion year-over-year. So I really think the gist of it is around the Print business. Our Print business did add about $0.5 billion of revenue and did grow operating profit dollars as well year-over-year, but it did come out a lower rate. Last year, we had 17.3% op margin. This year is 16% op margin. Really, the primary driver, and this is similar to the prior couple quarters, was the addition of S-Print. At the beginning of the year, we outlined that we had expected S-Print added on top of existing business to add another $1.4 billion and to be $0.01 accretive for the year. The simple math on that is  a 1% op margin, albeit back-end loaded. That's really the primary driver of why we didn't see as much drop and had a lower margin. We also do continue to invest in our growth in future categories, A3 and 3D Printing specifically. We see opportunities to disrupt the big markets there. We did place more units as you said, and our Supplies mix is down year-over-year. To a lesser extent, we saw some incremental raw material costs on the Print side. But the net of it is, is when you add it all up, I think we're operating closer to 16% range and driving incremental operating profit dollars year-over-year. Dion Weisler : I think that was really well articulated, Steve. The only add I would make is that when I refer to us playing our own game, this is exactly what I was talking about. It's about us executing against our strategy that has the 3 pillars of core, growth and future, some of that, which is still in investment mode. So I believe, consistently, our performance demonstrates our ability to drive improved operating profit dollars year-over-year whilst also investing for the long term. And that's something that I've committed to since we separated almost 3 years ago. Toni Sacconaghi : And to follow up, as you noted, your cash return to shareholders has been year-to-date slightly above your 75% high end of your range. But 75% of that return has been through buybacks and 25% through dividends. So I guess, the question that I have is why is not a north of 75% cash return to shareholders something that's -- why is that not sustainable? And then as we think about a total return to shareholders, initially post the split, it was more balanced between dividends and buybacks. Is there a incremental bias to buybacks and we should expect this kind of ratio on a go-forward basis? Steven Fieler : Yes. So our capital allocation strategy is in support of our business strategy. It does give us ability to invest in our business to drive long-term returns across the core, growth and future. It does give us the ability to support our shift to contractual to maintain investment-grade credit rating for our customers and also the flexibility to accelerate our strategy when we have opportunities to do so. And I think the Apogee transaction that we referred to earlier is a good example. So we think we've got a capital allocation strategy that is working. As you point out, we have returned roughly 80% year-to-date, and we were active in buying back shares. We saw an attractive opportunity to do so, and so we took advantage of it. As it relates to dividends themselves, our board does consider a dividend policy periodically. If we have any updated changes, we'll certainly communicate that to you. Operator : And the next questioner today, we have Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Jyhhaw Liu : This is Irvin Liu dialing in for Amit. From a commodity perspective, I think NAND pricing and to some extent, DRAM pricing has been more favorable versus 90 days ago. In the event that you're able to benefit from component price declines, should we expect a near-term margin lift for the Personal Systems segment? Or do you anticipate having to share some of this benefit with your customers and also to maintain your share in the PC market? Steven Fieler : Well, we look at the overall basket of commodities, you mentioned a couple, but the overall basket of commodities and logistics cost. Our perspective is that sequentially from Q3 to Q4 it is stable, so it is, in essence, a neutral impact. We are also though seeing much more currency volatility and specifically more recently, the dollar strengthening. So as we think about the drop rate or op margin in the Personal Systems business and the impact on pricing, we have to think holistically about all the various factors and market dynamics from commodities to FX, and that certainly will be factored into how we show up in Q4. Jyhhaw Liu : And I also had a question about your broader contractual and services business, which is inclusive of Device as a Service, Managed Print Services and Instant Ink among others. Given the growth in these businesses and the acquisition of Apogee, how should we think about your longer-term target mix of services or contractual revenue? And what are some of the milestones and metrics we can use to help us better track the performance of your services portfolio? Steven Fieler : Yes. I think in many of the examples you described, certainly Device as a Service as an example, it isn't material to our overall results today, but it is material to our long-term strategy. And I think as these businesses continue to evolve and continue to grow and accelerate, we will be able to provide more visibility and metrics in the future. But right now I think the metrics we're sharing around our core business are more material, but I think we can evolve that over time. Dion Weisler : And I think specifically as it relates to Personal Systems, we've said that we believe the business over the long term is in the range of 3% to 5%. We delivered 3.9% this quarter. Over the long term, we expect that services is a more margin-rich opportunity for us. So in addition to the mixing up that we have been doing, services will enable that window above the 4% that we traditionally had to now the 3% to 5%. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Jim Suva with Citi. Jim Suva : On your Printing business, looking at the operating margins, it looks like year-over-year -- and when we look at it that way, that way we [ don't have ] seasonality. But year-over-year, it's been declining for about the past 3 quarters. Sounds like a lot of investments. But when will these investments really start to pay out? When we think about the ink consumption that I do at home or things like that, I would think that people would be replacing their toner and ink more than once every year or so. So when are these investments really going to pay dividends and how should we think about that? Or is there something else like the Samsung integration or the recent acquisition that is maybe not making it as comparable? Steven Fieler : Yes. And so to follow up on to the remarks earlier in the strategy we are driving in Print. It includes integrating S-Print, placing units, investing in the growth in future, but also driving productivity. And when I look at our rate now it is more driven by the addition of S-Print than any of those other factors. That's why I'd expect in the short to midterm to be closer to the bottom end of our long-term range around 16% because it is the strategy we're executing. We're driving operating profit dollar expansion. You've seen OP dollar improvement in Print for the past 4 quarters. And yes, we are investing in our growth categories, and we do think there's a long-term opportunity there. But you first have to build your installed base, place those units, and you're going to get the supplies attached later on. Jim Suva : Later on, like when does that later on come? Steven Fieler : In the years ahead. Just like we have built the rest of our business in Print, it takes time to build your installed base and have supplies attached. And so when we look out to the -- certainly the years ahead, we do expect that we continue to drop the OP dollars but also get the margin expansion from a rate perspective. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Sherri Scribner : You've seen very robust growth in the printer business over the past 2 years. In the past couple of quarters, a lot of that robustness has come from ASP improvements. ASPs are up somewhere around 600 to 700 basis points more than units for you guys. As we think about the next couple of quarters and stabilizing of some of the component costs, how much of a benefit do you think ASP increases will be for the business? I guess, another way to ask it would be do you think you'll continue to be able to mix up to higher ASP products. Or should we see some stabilization where revenue and units grow at similar rates? Dion Weisler : Sherri, [ confirm ] [indiscernible]. Were you talking about Print there or PCs? Sherri Scribner : I'm sorry, PCs. Steven Fieler : Okay, great. Maybe I'll comment, first, Dion, just on that ASP environment. So Sherri, in Q3, let me use that as sort of an example, which can set up sort of a comment on the prospectively. But in Q3, we did see, once again, positive ASPs. That was driven -- like other quarters, really bifurcated between 2 factors, the first of which is we continue to drive a better product mix. I'd say that's roughly 1/3 of the benefit we saw in the quarter, and the remaining 2/3 was just overall pricing. And again, that sort of takes in the multiple factors from rising component logistics cost, which lends to increase in pricing but also takes into account what's happening to FX and overall competitive environment. And so looking forward, certainly an important part of our strategy is to drive and continue to drive product mix. In many of those categories, we are under indexed today, so we do feel like we've got opportunity. That being said, as commodities begin to stabilize here, that is less of a year-over-year tailwind on ASPs. But I think most importantly, we're going to focus on continuing to great -- develop great products to the market, and that's really what's going to drive, as much as anything, the improvement on the revenue side. I don't know if, Dion, you have any other comments you'd make on the PC. Dion Weisler : I think the only other comment, Steve, would be our increased focus as a business on Everything as a Service. And as we drive that strategy, it's roughly half the market, roughly half of the $334 billion TAM. That's a new opportunity for us as an organization where we're under-indexed. It's certainly a market trend. Our customers are looking to have that kind of contractual relationship with us. And I think that also drives growth in the future. Sherri Scribner : Okay, great. And then switching gears to the Printing business. The margins related -- margins for that business are at the low end of your range, and you've made it quite clear that, that's related to the acquisition of Samsung. As we move into the fourth quarter, your commentary, Steve, seemed to suggest that margins would actually soften. So I guess, I'm trying to understand, should we think about 4Q margins falling below your long-term target and then possibly improving as we move into fiscal '19? Steven Fieler : I was not trying to imply that we would go below our 16% to 18% range. I was just trying to suggest that in the near to midterm, we'd be closer to the bottom end of that range. And so I think that reflects both Q4. I'm not going to comment any more specifically on the outlook. We have SAM coming up where we can kind of give the details about '19 and beyond. But for Q4, we would expect to still stay within our range. Operator : Next questioner today will be Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Just as a follow-up to the last question, just trying to think about how you guys -- as we possibly see some normalization on the ASP benefits in the PC market, how you think about the growth dynamics of the PC market overall from a shipment perspective. Any kind of metrics you can share in terms of aged installed base and an opinion on what you think really kind of opens up the opportunities for the Everything as a Service to really start to drive the business model? Is there something that you're looking at specifically that starts to engage the customer base, the installed base on those opportunities that you see? Dion Weisler : Yes. Look, I think we've certainly been engaging that customer base, which is why we're outperforming the market. We outperformed the market again by 5.4 points this quarter. That resulted in us growing our revenue 12% on top of last year's 12% growth. So it wasn't against the -- an easy compare because we continue to play our own game of profitable growth of segmenting the market, of finding areas of growth that our engineering team and our people believe that we can engineer experiences that amaze them and encourage them to buy our products. And that's why we have had continuous share gain for the past 18 consecutive quarters we've outgrown the market. We broadly agree with the analysts that still predict the overall market will decline slightly in units in traditional PCs with relatively flattish revenue. Would suggest that ASPs will go up slightly. And in our business, we are taking change and turning it to opportunity. We have a consistent track record of doing that, whether that's a tougher currency environment or trade situations or other fluctuating market forces. What we are also obviously cognizant of is a Windows 7 sunset that will happen and the migration of customers to Windows 10. We think that's a little less spiky than it has been in the past. And the glide slope is a little smoother up and to the right because companies much like ours that have already fully deployed on Windows 10 have deployed Windows 10 earlier in the transition cycle than they have in previous cycles. So we think that's a positive stimulus in the market. So with all of that, we're poised to continue to gain profitable shares and move forward. Aaron Rakers : Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, just curious since you brought it up, the trade situation. How does -- how do you guys see that? Any effect at this point? Any concerns that you might have looking forward? Dion Weisler : Well, I don't think it has had a material impact on our business to date. We, like all companies, are monitoring the evolving market dynamics and the situation very closely. I can tell you that we don't speculate or comment on the situation until we know all the facts and things become more definitive. We continue to assess the actions that are announced and we go to work on making the best outcomes for our customers and our shareholders. And we work with the U.S. administration, make sure they understand our point of view on suggested changes. But our supply chain team and our go-to-market team and all areas of our business, including our board ecosystem of suppliers, customers and partners, work together to take any change and turn it to opportunity. And just we'll monitor the situation and evolve it as necessary. Steven Fieler : Just to be clear, our guidance does include the impact of tariffs in place, which, as Dion said, are not material to us. We have not included any potential impact from new tariffs being contemplated. Operator : And the final questioner today will be Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Roderick Hall : So I had a couple of questions. I guess, one is with regard to the Supplies growth rate. I know that S-Print's in there and driving some of that year-over-year growth, but just curious if you guys would comment on what the underlying kind of organic growth there is. And if you don't want to comment on that, maybe just give us an update on whether you're still thinking flat next year as a possible outcome or a probable outcome. And then I have a follow-up. Steven Fieler : So we have been pretty predictive with what we call the 4-box model. And at the beginning of this year, Cathie outlined that we had expected from Q2 to Q4 that our Supplies would grow between 5% to 7% in constant currency, and that's actually exactly what we've been delivering. Within that 5% to 7% growth, that does incorporate legacy S-Print as well as HP Supplies. Given the fact that these businesses are integrated, our sales teams are selling SKUs and making trade-offs in the field, we do not have the ability to accurately break out what's inorganic versus organic, and that's why we put them together in our outlook. So we think forward to FY '19, we do have some headwinds. We do have some tailwinds, but we reflect on the 4-box model and what it's predicting. We have confidence that we will be flat to slightly up next year. Dion Weisler : And I think what you should expect from us is that we will continue to focus on executing against our strategy, both in our core as well as our growth initiatives in this area, which take time to fully play out into the P&L as Steve's alluded to throughout the call. We'll be relentless in our focus on optimizing all levers we have to impact Supplies with the right balance to ensure predictive value over the long term. I, like Steve, also have a lot of confidence in the predictive value of our 4-box model, which is the basis for what we guided for the rest of FY '18 and '19. Steven Fieler : No follow-up. Dion Weisler : Okay. Steven Fieler : All right. Dion Weisler : So with that, I'd like to thank you all for taking the time to join us today. I'm really pleased with our Q3 performance. This quarter's another example of how we're delivering against our results by combining innovation with operational excellence. That said, we're never satisfied. Profitable growth will continue to be our priority as we move forward. Our strategy is working. The team is incredibly focused. And our commitment to our customers, partners, employees and investors has never been stronger. So overall, I think we're in a very strong position with our business and our reinvention journey remains confident in our strategy and our ability to grow. With that, I look forward to seeing you all at our Security Analyst Meeting on October 3 at the New York Stock Exchange in New York City. Thank you all. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining, and you may now disconnect.",

Thanks for joining us. It was great to see so many of you in New York for our Security Analyst Meeting. As we close fiscal 2018, I'm proud of the results we delivered. It was a strong quarter and an exceptional year for HP. Our results demonstrate sustained operational performance, a disciplined investment framework and prudent cost management. Our core growth and future strategy is working, and we are well positioned for continued success across our categories and our regions. For quarter 4, we delivered revenue of $15.4 billion, up 10%, with strong performance across regions and businesses; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.54, an increase of 23%; and strong free cash flow of approximately $800 million. For the full year, we grew 12%, adding over $6.4 billion of revenue. We grew non-GAAP earnings per share 22% to $2.02. We returned over $3.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and we generated these results while continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives that are helping to strengthen our long-term competitiveness.  We are consistently executing and winning with customers and partners while simultaneously fulfilling the commitments we made to our shareholders. With our winning portfolio and strong financials, we enter 2019 well positioned to compete across Personal Systems, Printing and 3D.  Let's look at each of our segments. Personal Systems continued to deliver impressive profitable growth both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. In quarter 4, revenue and operating profit grew 11%. For the full year, revenue grew 13%, and operating profit grew even faster at 17%, adding more than $200 million to the bottom line. These results reinforce the strength of our market position as we focus on segmentation and delivering differentiated hardware, services and solutions.  HP continues to be a leader in product design. At our analyst meeting, we introduced you to the stunning way of the Spectre Folio. The product is now hitting the market, receiving high praise for design, versatility and performance and driving renewed excitement in the PC category. We also recently launched 2 new Spectre x360s. The Spectre x360 13 delivers the world's longest battery life in a quad-core convertible, while Spectre x360 15 is the most powerful convertible we've ever created. In Commercial, we unveiled the latest EliteBook, the world's smallest and lightest 14-inch business convertible and the first with gigabit class 4G LTE. In gaming, our OMEN PCs and displays powered the Overwatch World Cup where 24 countries battled for domination in front of nearly 10 million viewers. We also launched our latest OMEN desktop and our remote service called Game Stream that turns the OMEN PC into a cloud-based gaming server to enable experiences on the go. And at Adobe MAX, we unveiled the new Z by HP workstation portfolio and announced a subscription-based hardware and services bundle specifically designed for elite creative professionals that combines powerful PCs, pro-grade displays, printers and accessories.  As we innovate across our core, we are also continuing to accelerate our growth pillar with Device as a Service. 60% of IT organizations tell us their resources are increasingly taxed by device management, and 80% of their costs are coming after the PC is purchased. HP DaaS uses data and analytics to reduce costs and optimize the experience for IT and for end users. This quarter, the Technology Services Industry Association recognized HP DaaS with its STAR Award for Innovation in the standard managed service offering. This is one of the highest honors in the technology services industry.  Like Personal Systems, Printing continues to drive profitable growth. Total Print revenue was up 9% in quarter 4 and 11% for the full year with growth in all regions and across hardware and supplies. Operating profit grew in both periods, adding $177 million to the bottom line for the full year. This consistent growth is yet another proof point of customer adoption of HP's innovative portfolio.  Similar to the PC market, design is increasingly important for printers. Earlier in the quarter, we introduced the world's first smart home printer, HP Tango. Tango combines voice-activated and app-based printing with stunning design and convenience through our Instant Ink subscription program. We believe that Tango reinvents expectations for home printing, setting a new standard for print to fit seamlessly into consumers' lifestyles. We are also strengthening our leadership in the office space to drive new contractual and A3 growth opportunities. As we mark the anniversary of the S-Print acquisition, I am pleased with the progress we have made. We're one team focused on accelerating our penetration of this large addressable market. Earlier this month, we further accelerated our penetration of the copier market by completing the acquisition of Apogee, providing us with deep solutions and services expertise and a faster means to scale this business and tap into the profit pools that they offer.  Lastly, we are focused on growing our Graphic Solutions business. Our strategy is to provide market-leading products and solutions that enable customization and personalization while reducing both inventory and turnaround time for print service providers. A key win that showcases the power of digital is ePac Flexible Packaging, an all-digital flexible packaging converter who purchased 20 additional HP Indigo digital presses to expand operations across the U.S.  In 3D Printing, this quarter, we announced a new Metal Jet platform, bringing 3D mass production to the metals manufacturing industry for the first time. We're excited by the potential of this business and are working closely with automotive and industrial leaders like GKN, Volkswagen, Parmatech and many more. We're especially encouraged by the volume of final part applications we are delivering across verticals, including the transportation, industrial and medical markets. At Formnext earlier this month, together with customers and partners, we showcased many of the new applications that have developed over the last year. One of these, BMW, is now manufacturing production parts for their cars on HP's Multi Jet Fusion. And FORECAST 3D now has 2 dozen Multi Jet Fusions deployed, operating around the clock to produce millions of final parts as their business grows.  Looking at the year in total. We made great strides in 3D Printing. We expanded our portfolio, increased the number of customer applications tenfold, signed numerous strategic partnerships and generated multiunit customer orders. Multi Jet Fusion is now the most used industrial 3D printer in the world.  Overall, I'm pleased with our company's 2018 results. We've done what we said we would do. We're growing the business, top line and bottom line, and generating strong cash flow. We're delivering returns for our shareholders and investing in the future to create long-term value. Looking ahead to 2019, as we said at the recent Security Analyst Meeting, we're monitoring several evolving market dynamics, including the global trade environment and currency volatility. In addition, our caution related to industry-wide CPU availability is now playing out and is constraining our growth. We're working diligently with our vendors and partners to reduce the short-term impacts on our customers in light of our ongoing strong demand. Against this backdrop, we are focused on the things that made us successful in 2018, including innovation, execution and cost management. Short-term category headwinds do not diminish our excitement about this business and will not derail our long-term strategy. We will continue to play our own game, execute our strategy with rigor and aim for sustainable growth for the long term. And we will do so with the same sense of urgency and passion that has propelled our business forward since separation.  With that, let me turn the call over to Steve to go through additional details. Steven Fieler : Thanks, Dion. We finished FY '18 with a strong Q4. Our results demonstrate the consistency of our strategy and focus on creating shareholder value for the long term. We delivered against our objectives with a focus on day-to-day execution while also investing in our strategic growth initiatives across Personal Systems, Printing and 3D to position the company for the future.  For the full year, we grew revenue and operating profit dollars across both Printing and Personal Systems. We also delivered strong earnings per share growth, generated $4.2 billion in free cash flow and returned 83% of that free cash flow to shareholders, above the high end of our long-term range of 50% to 75%. Now let's look further into the results for the fourth quarter. Starting with the top line, net revenue was $15.4 billion, up 10% or up 9% in constant currency. Just as we've seen throughout the year, our performance remained strong across businesses and geographies. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas grew 6%, EMEA was up 9% and APJ grew 17%. Gross margin was 17.6%, down 0.5 points, primarily resulting from the addition of S-Print. Sequentially, gross margin was down 0.8 points, driven by seasonal business mix and currency. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.6 billion were up 7%. This increase was driven by the addition of S-Print along with the incremental R&D and go-to-market investments to support growth. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $54 million for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.54, up $0.10 or 23% year-over-year with a diluted share count of approximately 1.6 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes amortization of intangible assets of $20 million, acquisition-related charges of $26 million and restructuring and other GAAP-only charges totaling $45 million, offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $54 million and related tax impact on all of these items. It also excludes a net gain of $597 million related to tax adjustments. The noncash gain was primarily related to a change in our ability to utilize certain deferred tax assets. As a result, Q4 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.91.  At the segment level, Personal Systems net revenue remained strong, delivering $10.1 billion, up 11%. Results were again broad-based across customer segments, geographies and products, reflecting the strength of our product portfolio, go-to-market and supply chain. By customer segment, Consumer and Commercial revenue were both up 11%. By product category, revenue was up 14% for Notebooks, up 6% for Desktops and up 10% for Workstations. In calendar quarter 3, our market share was 22.5% as we continued to execute our strategy and focus on profitable growth. Our performance was driven by strong execution as we managed a dynamic market environment and the initial signs of CPU shortages, which we expect will constrain our growth in the first half of 2019. Personal Systems continued to grow operating profit, up $37 million versus last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher volume and better ASPs, partially offset by higher commodities and logistics costs and the initial impact of tariffs in the U.S. Operating margin was 3.8%, flat year-over-year.  In Printing, revenue was $5.3 billion in the quarter, up 9%. We have made steady progress in the performance of the business and remain focused on managing our core businesses of building for the future across our strategic growth initiatives. Total hardware units were up 11% with Consumer units up 3% and Commercial units up 85%, including S-Print. We continue to take advantage of opportunities to place NPV positive units when we see them. In calendar quarter 3, overall Print unit share was 42%.  Q4 Supplies revenue of $3.4 billion was up 7%. The Supplies mix of total Print revenue was 64%, down year-over-year and sequentially. We continue to operate below our ceilings for Supplies channel inventory. For the full year, Supplies revenue grew in line with our outlook, inclusive of the acquired S-Print supply stream and installed base which, as we described at SAM, we expect to continue to decline. Printing operating profit grew $46 million versus last year and operating margin was 16.1%, down 0.5 points year-over-year, up 0.1 points sequentially. The primary drivers of the year-over-year margin decline were the addition of S-Print and the strong unit placements as well as investments in growth and future initiatives, including A3 and 3D Printing, partially offset by favorable currency.  Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Q4 cash flow from operations was $968 million, and free cash flow was $843 million. For the full year, we delivered free cash flow of $4.2 billion, above our previously provided guidance of at least $3.7 billion. Q4 free cash flow includes both the timing benefit of higher Personal Systems volume and a better year-end cash conversion cycle of minus 32 days. This was an improvement versus our prior outlook of minus 29 to minus 30 days, driven by lower days of inventory. Sequentially, cash conversion cycle weakened 2 days, in line with typical seasonality with a 3-day decrease in days payable outstanding; a 2-day increase in days sales outstanding, driven by revenue linearity; and a 3-day decrease in days of inventory, largely a result of a decrease in strategic purchases. We returned $598 million to shareholders through share repurchases and $219 million via cash dividends in Q4. For the full year, we returned $3.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends or 83% of free cash flow.  Looking forward to FY '19, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook : Based on recent moves in the U.S. dollar, we are expecting increased headwind from currency compared to the end of September rates we used in the outlook we provided at SAM. Our plans to mitigate previously announced and implemented China-U.S. tariffs are on track. As described at SAM, we expect the headwind to be larger in the short term and reduced throughout the year. We have not considered any impact from unannounced tariffs or any significant demand changes that may result from an increase in geopolitical uncertainties.  Specific to Personal Systems, we expect CPU supply constraints through the first half of 2019. Regarding the overall basket of components and logistics, we expect the cost to improve compared to Q4 levels. This should offset some of the increased currency headwind, assuming the market is not incrementally more competitive. In Printing, we continue to expect overall Supplies revenue to be flat to slightly up for the full year. And we are including the full year expected impact from the Apogee acquisition. In addition, for the full year, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate, which is based on our long-term non-GAAP financial projection, to be 16% in FY '19.  Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook : Q1 '19 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.53, Q1 '19 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.49. We are maintaining our full year fiscal 2019 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.12 to $2.22 and full year fiscal '19 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.04 to $2.14, and we expect to return approximately 75% of free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases over the course of the full year.  And now let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today will be Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani : Two questions from me. I guess, maybe the first one, Dion, you mentioned about CPU shortages impacting your growth in the quarter you're in. Can you just touch on how much revenues do you think you left on the table due to these issues? And as you think about the first half, is the impact sort of start to diminish in Q1 and Q2? Or does it actually magnify more so which is on Q4? Dion Weisler : Okay. Thanks, Amit. So you'll recall at the Security Analyst Meeting that we said we were cautious for the first half of 2019 with regards to CPU shortages. And that's exactly what's playing out. Intel stated again this week that shortages are constraining the customers' growth across their ecosystem, and we're seeing that impact across multiple core families of processes and chipsets that have an effect or an impact, both the high end and the low end of the range. We also said at SAM that we expect bigger impact in the first half of 2019 with more variability around revenue, depending on the ability to secure supply in order to meet our robust demand. The demand signal for our products is and remains really strong even through the market supply constraints that we're seeing. And while the shortages are expected to put a strain on the industry and the ecosystem, this is just something that we have to work through with our supplies, our partners and our customers in the short term. Steven Fieler : Yes. The one thing I'd add there, as Dion said, our caution is definitely playing out, and it's really not dramatically different than our views at the Security Analyst Meeting in totality but probably expected more of an impact in Q4 and so would see a larger impact in Q1 than we saw in Q4. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And Steve, let me just follow up. You had very impressive free cash flow in fiscal '18 at $4.2 billion. As I think about the fiscal '19 guide of $3.7 billion, and I think you had assumed, at least at the Analyst Day, that cash conversion cycle would improve by a couple of days in '19 versus '18, can you just help me understand what are the couple of levers or headwinds you have that drags down fiscal -- free cash flow down in fiscal '19? Or are we just being conservative over here? Steven Fieler : Yes, so maybe I'll just sort of describe then some of the assumptions. We did have a strong finish to fiscal '18, in Q4 specifically. And as a reminder, we do expect that -- our free cash flow to grow in line with earnings over time. But as we saw for the full year and again in Q4, we had stronger Personal Systems volume, and we did have an improving cash conversion cycle. Personal Systems volume, for example, grew 7% sequentially from Q3 to Q4, and our cash conversion cycle was minus 32 days. That was better than our outlook for the year. And how that then bridges to '19, I do remain confident in delivering at least $3.7 billion for the full year. However, taking into account our strong FY '18 results did pull in some upside from '19. And also, given some of the comments we just made on the constraints on CPUs, I would expect that, in the first half, some of the softening of the Personal Systems revenue and constraints, we'd expect a weaker first half free cash flow just given the negative working capital on the Personal Systems business. So the assumptions that I discussed at SAM hold. I'd just add, we have factored in all of the respective segment-level kind of business volume, including the implied slower growth in Personal Systems. And we've also seen additional opportunities to improve cash conversion cycle beyond the minus 32 days, primarily around DPO. And finally, we do expect now to have other cash flow favorability in '19, including timing of certain tax and other cash items. So altogether, our bottoms of outlook gives us confidence of maintaining at least $3.7 billion for the full year. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Wamsi Mohan : Dion, just a clarification on your answer to the prior question. You said you are seeing constraints, CPU constraints, both at the high end and the low end of the range. I was wondering if you could maybe give us some color that could help us triangulate, like, is the -- either in terms of units or in terms of revenue impact in the first half of the year that you would be seeing from these CPU shortages that can help us like think through the quantification of that? And I have a follow-up. Dion Weisler : Yes, I would say it actually affects both units as well as revenue. And I believe that the shortages, certainly, what we are seeing today exist both at the low end of the range as well as the high end of the range. So there is a mix. And the mix is still moving around as Intel is working furiously to get capacity up to support demand. So it is -- it's moving around, but I expect that we will see it both in terms of units and in revenue. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. And as a follow-up, are you seeing any evidence of the channel behaving differently in terms of maybe building some inventory ahead of these tariffs? And what are you thinking about from a broader supply chain standpoint, if there are incremental tariffs that are not included in your guidance, as those get put on. What are some of the levers that you can use? Are you thinking about moving production and working with your ODM partners to do incrementally more outside of China? If you could give some color there, that'd be great. Dion Weisler : Sure. So in terms of -- so the first part of your question there was around inventory levels and partner behavior and customer behavior. What I would say is our demand signal is really strong. It's not perfectly measurable exactly how much of that is because of a well-understood reality of the shortages. We're looking at our sellout data very closely. And that gives us a signal as what are actually going into end customers' hands, and that remains broadly strong. And so I think whilst -- generally, when this happens in the industry, there is a tendency for a lot of order load to come into the system. We're certainly seeing that. But I would say, generally speaking, as you're seeing through the course of 2018, demand has been strong for our products off the back of really strong innovation. Steve, you might tackle the first part of the tariff question, and I'm happy to comment as well. Steven Fieler : Yes, I mean it's somewhat kind of what I commented earlier. I mean, at this point, we have factored in to our guidance all of the known tariffs. This includes the tariffs that were announced, implemented in the September period. We have not included any incremental unannounced tariffs into our guide, and we have multiple levers that we're implementing to mitigate the tariffs. There's a variety of strategies in place. But at this point, there's no reason for us to put into any sort of guidance what is an unknown. So we're just sticking with what we know and the certainties around that. Dion Weisler : And I think we've been pretty consistent about that. We said we'd continue to monitor the evolving tariff situation just as all of you are doing as well, I'm sure. We've said it before, we don't speculate or chase ghosts. We have, as Steve mentioned, a number of levers available to us should additional tariffs come into place. The tariffs that we know about, the first tranche and the second tranche, have been fully factored into the guide that Steve provided at the Security Analyst Meeting. And we'll continue to work to optimize all of our operations to deal with the industry dynamics that are just part of operating this business. Operator : And the next questioner today will be Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. I just wanted to follow up on some of the previous commentary. I was at the Securities Analyst Meeting, and my sense was that the message around CPU availability was much softer than it was on this call. I think the notion was we face these. We can manage around it. There will be some impact, but we can manage it. And it feels like, incrementally, that's become a bigger issue than you had thought. And kudos to you that you can still manage around it and uphold your guidance. But I just wanted to be clear about whether this is incrementally tougher than you thought a month ago. And ultimately, what has driven it? Is it stronger-than-expected demand or the relative availability to you, as one of the biggest players, is not as strong as you thought? And I have a follow-up, please. Steven Fieler : Yes. I think, Toni, I think a part of your question sort of answers it, which is we are maintaining our full year guidance and our Q1 outlook of $0.50, $0.53. It does incorporate all of the known risk and opportunities, including the risks around the CPU constraints. At SAM, we did talk about the caution, and that caution is clearly playing out. But again, it is all factored into our guidance. And I'd say, sort of directionally speaking, it's not dramatically different than what we provided from caution. It is just now real and playing out. Dion Weisler : And that demand still remains strong as it has been all throughout 2018. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. And then just on the tariff question. You have had some tariffs impact principally your desktop machines and your Workstations. I think in response to that, there's been selective price increases. I did notice your desktop growth rate was a little bit lower in the quarter than your notebook growth rate. So I'm wondering if you can comment on whether you've seen any elasticity associated with price changes from tariffs. And then secondly, if we were to see the $200 billion in tariffs, would that not apply to essentially all of your notebook business and the vast majority of your Printing business? Or am I misguided in that assertion? Steven Fieler : Yes, I mean taking a step back on Q4, the overall tariffs that have been announced, implemented through September, I'd say, didn't have material impact on the company. But to your question, they did have impact in our Personal Systems business and in desktop. And you saw that, really, it's a margin headwind that we help mitigate through other factors. And we are working through a variety of mitigation items on the tariffs. Pricing could indeed be one of the ways we mitigate, but there's others ways to do it as well. Maybe, Dion, if you want to talk about the broader unknowns, but there's not a whole lot to say. Dion Weisler : Yes. So I think, Toni, it's important to understand how we think about pricing in all of our markets. We have a pretty definitive process and strategy that looks at our products' performance adjusted based on the various differences from one SKU to another SKU, what we call PFE. And we set a strategy market by market, and we need to ensure that we remain competitive. So I would say that we're obviously watching our pricing very carefully. We're looking at our competitors' pricing very carefully. We tend not to lead the market down on price. And sometimes, in many cases, we're the first to take up pricing. But having said that, I think Steve's quite right. We've got many levers available to us, and we're exercising all of them. As it sort of relates to the second part of the question, which was around... Steven Fieler : Any unknowns. Dion Weisler : Any unknowns. We just don't chase ghosts, Toni. We don't know what the rates would be. If there were tariffs, we don't know to what extend -- extent it would include listed items. Would it be everything? Would it be partial? So rather than speculating on that, when they become announced, we put our mitigation plans into place. Operator : And the next questioner today will be Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : I was hoping you could provide some more insight into the competitive environment within Printing. Xerox and Lexmark have both had some pretty significant changes in senior leadership. Ricoh, I think, is a little more focused on profit. So I'm curious how you're seeing some of your competitors react to the industry. Dion Weisler : Yes. Look, I would say the Printing market is still -- there's many players. There's upwards of over a dozen players in the printing market. And in an overall market that's relatively flat, generally, what happens in that environment is, where you don't have the scale, it becomes more difficult to compete. Some of our competitors are a little distracted. Others are focused. We look at all of our competitors, but ultimately, we're playing our game. We have an incredible portfolio of products, a very clear strategy, both transactionally as well as the work we're doing in our contractual space. Our security messages are really resonating with our customers. It's on every C-level executives' mind, and we have the most secure printers on the planet. Our Managed Print Services business continues to be an area of focus for us. The integration of Samsung's business has just gone through its first-year anniversary, and I'm really pleased with how we've integrated that company and how we're making progress against our goals in the A3 contractual space. So all in all, we're playing our game, and we're very focused on that. And we'll continue to be competitive in the marketplace. Shannon Cross : And then with regard to 3D Printing, you had a successful show, I think, at Formnext. Clearly, there have been some product launches during the past year and then coming up in calendar 2019. What are you hearing from end markets? Do you feel like you're getting to a point where there's an inflection in demand within 3D Printing? Where are the areas that you're seeing the most growth and the most interest and sort of as you look to next year? Dion Weisler : Yes. Look, I'm really excited by the 3D Printing businesses. It's an incredible business. And as we talked about in the Securities Analyst Meeting, it sits on our third time horizon of the future, and it's not something that we expect will have a material impact for us in 2019. But over time, in my mind, it's incredibly clear. It's not a question of if the Fourth Industrial Revolution will happen, it's when. And we are certainly positioning ourselves to be in pole position when that happens. We've had a great 3 years since we announced the creation of the business, and we introduced our first technology. We've done exactly what we said we would do. We said we would lay markers for all of you because we don't talk about the financials specifically, but they would be very specific markers and milestones by which you could hold us accountable to. And I think we've delivered on all of those. The introduction of the 3D printer for the plastics market. We've become the #1 player for production in a very short period of time. We've expanded our portfolio in line with our expectations. We have, inside the first product that we released, the follow-on product, the 4210, which really improves productivity of core plastics. We introduced color with the 3M 500 Series, which will begin generating revenue in 2019. We introduced metals last quarter. Customers will begin using our metal production service with our partners in 2019. We've added new materials. We started with PA 12 plastic. We then moved to glass beads. We've got PA 11 and TPU coming very soon and metal powders with GKN, which is really focused in the automotive industry. So with the partnerships that we've created and the ecosystem we're building, we're right on track to how we think we maintain this market leadership as the industry is set to disrupt this $12 trillion industry. Operator : And the next questioner today will be Jim Suva with Citi Investment Research. Jim Suva : Kind of a housekeeping question then more of a strategy question. The housekeeping question is on your EPS guidance that you gave last month, am I correct that, that included like $0.01 or $0.02 from Apogee? And is that still intact? Or is that incrementally changing at all? That's the housekeeping item. Then strategically, when we think about if memory prices come lower because the past, say, 12 to 18 months, you've been adjusting prices higher, are you going to be adjusting prices actively lower? Are you looking to harvest some of that profitability or give some of it back because it looks like you've been gaining share still while increasing pricing? So I'm just kind of wondering about the strategy of how we should think about those component costs in your go-to-market strategy. Steven Fieler : So Jim, on the housekeeping topic, the guide provided today does include Apogee, and at the Securities Analyst Meeting, it did not. So we have -- just getting started with the year and have -- the range captures kind of all the known risk and opportunities. But I have included Apogee in the guide today. Dion Weisler : And as it relates to the sort of second part of the question, whilst it's true memory is certainly trending lower, overall, some of that is offset with currency headwinds with the stronger U.S. dollar that we are seeing. But again, we use this mechanism of price function value as we look at all of our competitors. We don't lead the market down on price. We want to ensure that we remain competitive in the marketplace. We are vigilant always on cost management across the ecosystem. And we're just looking to segment the markets, find the profitable areas of growth in the business and target profitable growth. We don't chase share for share's sake. Operator : And the next questioner today will be John Roy with UBS. John Roy : So you are able to pretty much hit your Print margin number for the quarter. Can you give us the puts and takes that would make that move around for the rest of fiscal '19? And what are you thinking essentially all-in when you sum it all together where you might come out for '19? Steven Fieler : Well, we're pleased with the profit we drove in Print in Q4. We've been focused on driving incremental operating profit dollars consistent with our strategy, and we grew $46 million year-over-year and, for the full year, $177 million. And so we'll continue to focus on our strategy. That includes investing in our business, in A3 and the opportunities to disrupt that market and also 3D Printing. We're also going to continue to place units where we see NPV positive opportunities to do so. So as we're shifting the business over time to more services and contractual, we're going to operate that business with an operating margin target in the next 3 years of at least 16%. And we'll continue to drive Supplies to flat to slightly up this year. Operator : And the next questioner today will be Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Paul Coster : I'm just wondering if the trade conflict that seems to be happening with China, whether that has any impact on your ability to go into the PC end market there, which I know, in the past, you've described as being an area where you're underindexed at the moment, so a growth opportunity. Dion Weisler : Look, China has been and continues to be a very strategically important market for us. We have a very strong brand in the country. We've been present for a very long time. We obviously continue to assess the situation and the potential impact on our business and our plans that we may or may not need to make as a result. But again, we're not chasing ghosts, but we're also not sticking our heads in the sand either. It's an important market and will remain so. Paul Coster : Okay. One quick follow-up. The printer market share seems to bounce around a little bit. It's up year-on-year but only 200 basis points, which is a little less market share gain than the prior quarter. Probably doesn't mean much is my guess, but I'm just wondering if you can give us a little bit of color on whether there's any segments in which you think you're outperforming strongly or struggling a little bit. Steven Fieler : Yes, I mean, we concur. I mean, I think the market in the long term has some ups and downs and pockets of growth. And in any particular quarter, share shifts will occur. For us, we're going to remain very disciplined on pursuing profitable share. It's what we did in the last quarter, and you see it in the calendar quarter 3. Where there's some pockets of the overall market, we're choosing not to compete. And we see that primarily on the low-end consumer. But overall, pleased with the performance, growing A3 and on the office more broadly. But I think to your question, I mean, there'll be puts and takes every quarter, but we'll be very disciplined on ensuring we go after the profitable growth. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Roderick Hall : So I guess, my first question is on the 0.8% move in gross margins. You'd said it was seasonality and FX. I just wonder if you might be able to quantify how much of that was FX on the sequential moves. And then I also wanted to see if you could update us on the A3 market share. You gave it last quarter, I believe, and you've got this target of 12%, so just curious how that progressed in the quarter. Steven Fieler : So I'll take the first one. The largest driver really was due to seasonality and a higher Personal Systems mix. Personal Systems again sequentially grew 7%. Print sequentially grew 2%. So that's the largest driver. Incremental to that, to your question, we did have some FX headwinds quarter-to-quarter. We did also have the initial impact of the tariffs on the Personal Systems side. But I would say, the short response is, the primary driver is really on the Personal Systems mix quarter-to-quarter. Dion Weisler : And as it relates to A3 share, Rod, we grew share year-over-year calendar quarter 3 by 0.8 points. And I remain really excited about the future opportunities and really encouraged by the progress of our A3 business since we started. We continue to introduce new products and solutions to complement an already very robust portfolio. We continue to sign our premier partners around the world, which is critical to scaling the business. We continue to focus on differentiators that really matter for our customers in areas like security and print quality. And as a reminder, and as we've said in the past, we don't expect the sequential growth to happen every single quarter. We remain on track to achieve our 12% market share by the end of calendar 2020. That's the marker, the longer-term marker we put in the ground. And that's what you can expect to see from us. Operator : And the next questioner today will be Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : I want to go back on the pricing discussion on the PC category. You guys have had several quarters now where pricing has been up solidly. And given the variables at play, I guess, the first question on that is, oftentimes in the past, HP has had the advantage of gaining share in the face of component supply constraints, such as the CPU situation, so I'm curious of how you plan to react and potentially if you see opportunity to take incremental share on that. And then second to that, on the component pricing dynamic, I'm curious of how much of the past couple of quarters in terms of pricing has been driven by mix versus, say, the pass-through of component pricing? Steven Fieler : So I'll take a crack at it. So on the last piece first. So what we saw in Q4, roughly speaking, about a 5-point ASP increase when you look at the revenue versus units. Just under 1/4 of that is the structural improvements we're making in mix. And the remainder was sort of the broader pricing category where we're factoring in the competitive situation, currency, commodities, et cetera. On the first part, I mean our strategy continues to be to kind of profitably grow share. And we see the current situation no different than we see it at any market situation where we like our product portfolio. We like our lineup. We like our ability to compete and win in the marketplace. And so just like we do in any market situation, our goals are go out there and to gain profitable share. Dion Weisler : The only thing I would add to that is you should expect to continue to see us focused on mix shift towards more profitable parts of the market as we do our segmentation. We've mentioned on previous calls premium and gaming. The Spectre Folio that we showed at the Security Analyst Meeting is an incredible piece of art and innovation, the intersection between the 2. And it's been really well received by our customers. So customers are looking for premium devices. Our gaming franchise continues to grow. We remain excited about that. And we're focused on other more profitable areas of the Personal Systems category. And you heard Alex say at the Security Analyst Meeting, there's displays and accessories and services where, traditionally, we've been underindexed, where we have a lot of focus as well as new growth opportunities with Device as a Service. Operator : And the next questioner today will be Steve Milunovich with Wolfe Research. Steven Milunovich : I believe that you're the largest user of AMD processors among the PC vendors. Is that the case? And does that relationship help you offset the Intel issues? Dion Weisler : So that's probably a better question for AMD to ask them if we're the largest or not. But I would say that we have had a very long partnership and a very good partnership with AMD for many years. They're part of our multisource strategy, and we have a variety of tremendous AMD offerings in our portfolios. Customers make decisions. They weigh price and performance and functionality when making purchasing decisions. And there are definitely segments and geographies where AMD offerings are an attractive alternative. Steven Milunovich : And on the A3 business, you've talked about this past year was a placement year of hardware and then, down the road, you would begin to benefit from the associated supplies and services. Do we get much of that benefit in fiscal '19? Or do you need the installed base to get larger, so it's more of a fiscal '20 occurrence? Steven Fieler : We\u2019ll start to get some benefit clearly in '19, but it does take time to get that installed base built. So we certainly see the greater upside in FY '20 and years beyond. Dion Weisler : And with that, I think we are out of time. Let me close by thanking you all for all of your attendance over the course of this year. It's been a very strong year for us this year in 2018. We've done what we said we would do. I'm very proud of that. As we look into and look ahead to 2019, we remain very focused on the things that have made us successful since separation. We're focused on innovation. We're focused on execution. We're focused on relentless cost management. We have very strong financials, the best portfolio, I think, we've ever had. We have solid opportunities across Personal Systems, Printing and 3D in core growth in future. We'll continue to play our own game, execute against our strategy with rigor and aim for sustainable growth for the long term.  With that, I wish you all happy holidays. Thanks very much for joining us. Operator : And the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In Q1, we once again delivered top and bottom line growth. We continued to demonstrate our ability to deliver on our EPS, generate free cash flow, and we remained focused on positioning the company for long-term sustainable growth. While this quarter had many areas of strength and progress against our plan, there was an unexpected challenge in supplies, and we have more work to do there. First, let me cover the highlights for the quarter and then talk about the business more broadly. In quarter 1, we delivered revenue of $14.7 billion, up 1% or up 2% in constant currency; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.52, an increase of 8% and in line with our outlook. And we generated strong free cash flow of approximately $700 million, returning almost $1 billion to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends.  Our results demonstrate the continued vitality of our innovation across the portfolio as well as our ability to execute and adapt in a tough environment. Our strategy remains consistent, and a key part of that strategy is our focus on continuing to refine our business model to match changing customer needs and market conditions. This is one of the core strengths of our organization. We have a proven track record of leveraging change to create opportunity.  Let's go through the performance of each of our businesses, starting with Personal Systems. Our Personal Systems team continues to perform at a high level, driven by a relentless focus on execution and profitable growth. In quarter 1, Personal Systems revenue grew 2% and delivered strong 4.2% operating margins. We are improving our product mix and managing our costs. As expected, the first half headwinds we previously shared with you are playing out, and we are navigating them well. We are also strengthening our position in strategic segments where we see pockets of growth and delivering differentiated and premium hardware, services and solutions. In January, we kicked off CES with a bold lineup of innovative firsts for modern lifestyles, changing workplaces and immersive gaming. For consumers, we introduced the new Spectre x360, the world's first 15-inch laptop with an AMOLED display for exceptional clarity and color. We announced the world's first Quantum Dot on Glass display, providing movie theater-quality visuals at home. And we showcased the world's first AMD-based Chromebook, bringing the power of cloud applications to a broader range of customers. We also introduced solutions designed to power the workforce, workplace and work styles of the future. We launched the third-generation of HP Sure View technology, further protecting users against digital hacking. And with more than 70% of U.S. workplaces using open-concept designs, we unveiled the world's first display and first all-in-one with an integrated privacy screen, giving workers confidence in their security and privacy. We also expanded our gaming portfolio with innovation that creates even more immersive experiences to take gaming to new heights. We debuted the world's first 65-inch gaming display with integrated sound bar and launched the new OMEN 15, featuring HP's fastest display refresh rate, 240 hertz, to help gamers stay ahead of the competition.  We also remained focused on driving innovation and growth in key vertical segments. This quarter, we introduced a variety of education-centric Chromebooks. Simple, secure and shareable devices that enable schools to empower the next generation of innovators and leaders. And in retail, we launched a new point-of-sale solution including a strategic collaboration with PayPal, specifically designed for small- and medium-sized retailers and hospitality owners.  In print, while we have made progress against our strategy, growing hardware revenue, share and operating profit dollars, our supplies performance did not meet our expectations this quarter. So this is what I want to cover first.  Supplies revenue was weaker than anticipated, particularly in EMEA, where supplies declined 9%. As you know, we look at our supplies business in terms of our 4- box model : in store base, usage, share and price. The 2 factors that varied from our plan were a decline in share and, to a lesser extent, pricing. We saw this most significantly in our commercial channels, which is having the largest impact on office supplies. There are several factors contributing to the change in customer purchasing behavior. All commercial customers are purchasing supplies online, and while we have leading share online, it's at a lower percentage than our share with traditional commercial resellers and in-store retailers. In addition, as macro uncertainty has increased, we have seen further price sensitivity among customers, pressuring both our share and our supplies pricing. The combination of these 2 factors negatively impacted HP Supplies share. It also changes our assumptions in the 4-box model for the remainder of the year. As a result, we no longer expect supplies to be flat to slightly up in fiscal '19. On a related note, we continued to maintain the levels of channel inventory under our Tier 1 ceiling and monitor Tier 2 inventory, where we had some visibility. However, we continue to fulfill orders likely over multiple quarters based on our regional share assumptions, which we now believe were overestimated. This resulted in additional HP supplies in the ecosystem, including the unmonitored downstream portion. In summary, this is what led to the challenges in supplies. Now let me tell you what we're going to do about it, and Steve will provide additional details. We are taking actions to lower the level of supplies inventory in the market to be consistent with our new share assumptions. And we are implementing additional share improvement plans, including online programs, targeted marketing and brand protection to promote the value of HP original supplies in terms of quality, sustainability and environmental impact. The team's agility and ability to respond to challenges gives me confidence in how we'll manage through this environment. We are taking action, and importantly, we are maintaining our non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow outlook for the full year.  As Enrique talked about at our Securities Analyst Meeting, our markets are changing, and we must keep evolving our business and business models. This is why we are focused on accelerating our strategy to more contractual sales, which we expect will have 2 benefits : diversifying our profit pool through services and securing a higher share of the supplies for these units. Both Instant Ink and Managed Print Services are examples of these models. The Instant Ink subscriber base continues to have impressive growth. We have now rolled out the program in 18 countries and continue to see strong adoption rates. In Managed Print Services, our machines-in-field number is growing double digits, and we are scaling our MPS coverage with expanded opportunities for our premier channel partners in both the A3 and A4 categories. We are also evolving our business to include products that generate a larger portion of their lifetime profitability at the time of purchase. This includes not only products like Sprocket but also our HP Smart Tank and HP Ink Tank printers that can print up to 8,000 color pages before more ink is required. These printers not only deliver strong total cost of ownership, they deliver the quality and durability that customers expect from HP Original Ink. Our print innovation continues to help define this business. In home, printing products like HP Tango X, the world's first smart app-based home printer, are helping us to make printing relevant again in modern homes and to a new generation of users. This quarter, Tango launched in APJ and expanded into new countries in EMEA. This printer is being called the smartest and most elegant printer on the market.  In office printing, our push into the contractual A3 market continues with the introduction of finishing capabilities on a range of systems that help to drive affordable color printing, best-in-class performance and energy efficiency. We now have 9% A3 market share, which is up 1.1 points since last year. In graphics, we introduced a design-to-print portfolio at Autodesk University to help users experience the speed and simplicity of HP PageWide XL and large-format printing solutions. This kind of innovation, paired with our transition to services, is how we'll reinvent the print category and deliver on our long-term opportunities. Looking at the 3D Printing business, we're expanding both our production and prototyping installed base across the automotive, industrial, consumer and health care markets. Millions of final production parts are now being produced each quarter on the Multi Jet Fusion platform, and the range of applications being printed is incredible. As part of our Multi Jet Fusion portfolio expansion, this quarter, we began ramping shipments of our 300/500 solutions targeted at the prototyping market. We also continued to execute on our 3D Printing metals technology, with partners including Volkswagen and GKN. As I speak with CEOs across multiple industries, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is here and is shaping up to be one of the most significant opportunities of our lifetime. The future of manufacturing and production is digital and is becoming a mainstream topic as businesses look to change the way they design, manufacture and deliver new products to their customers. Leaders from the corporate world, government and academia recognize there is incredible potential to not only unlock new economic growth but to also drive a more sustainable industrial revolution with new and reskilled workers. HP is leading the industry forward to democratize manufacturing with our 3D Printing technology. This continues to be an enormously exciting part of our business.  To sum up, HP delivered results consistent with our financial outlook, and we are generating strong cash flow and investing in the future to create long-term value. We know we have work to do to manage through the current supplies dynamics, and that's exactly what we're going to do. We will continue to play our own game, execute our strategy with rigor and focus on driving sustainable long-term growth. Our markets will continue to change and evolve, and we will focus on adapting and reinventing. With that, I'll pass the call over to Steve to go through additional details. Steven Fieler : Thanks, Dion. Looking at the company's Q1 financial results, we delivered revenue growth, with non-GAAP EPS growing even faster. And while our respective business results were mixed, we are making good progress across our core, growth and future strategy in important areas. In others, we have more work to do. As always, we will continue to balance where to invest and capture opportunities on one hand and where to drive efficiency or fix challenges on the other, all with a focus on creating long-term shareholder value.  Looking at the details of the first quarter, starting with the top line. Net revenue was $14.7 billion, up 1% or up 2% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas declined 2%, EMEA was up 2% and APJ grew 11%. Gross margin was 17.8%, flat year-over-year. Sequentially, gross margins were up 20 basis points, driven by improved rate in both Personal Systems and Print. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.6 billion, up 1% driven by an increase in SG&A. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $57 million for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.52, up $0.04 or 8%, with a diluted share count of approximately 1.6 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes amortization of intangible assets of $29 million, acquisition-related charges of $10 million, restructuring and other charges of $55 million, nonoperating retirement-related credits of $12 million, tax adjustments of $55 million and a tax-related impact on all of these items. As a result, Q1 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.51. At the segment level, in Personal Systems, we are pleased with our results and ability to navigate the current environment. We have demonstrated a strong track record of execution and financial performance, and demand for our products remains strong. Revenue in the first quarter was $9.7 billion, up 2% against a tough year-over-year compare and industry-wide supply constraint. Operating profit was $410 million, up $75 million versus last year. Operating margins were 4.2%, up 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by better pricing and mix, partially offset by higher costs and currency. Sequentially, operating margins were up 50 basis points, driven by better pricing and mix as well as cost favorability, partially offset by currency. By customer segment, consumer revenue was up 1%, and commercial revenue was up 3%. By product category, revenue was up 6% for notebooks, down 3% for desktops and up 3% for workstations. In calendar quarter 4, our market share was 23.6%. We continued to execute our strategy and focus on growth areas such as premium and gaming, and at the same time, leveraged the scale of our business including our supply chain and go-to-market. In print, our results were more challenged. We grew hardware revenue, increased our unit share and continued to make progress in our contractual offerings. However, this performance was offset by disappointing total supplies revenue. Let me start with some comments on supplies, and then I'll summarize the rest of the print results. First quarter Supplies revenue was $3.3 billion, down 3%, which is below our expectation, driven primarily by EMEA. During the quarter, we saw a slowdown in sell-through from Tier 1 to Tier 2 channels. Therefore, consistent with our Supplies sales model, we reduced our revenue sell-in so that we would maintain channel inventory levels below our Tier 1 ceiling. The size of the slowdown made it increasingly apparent that inventory had grown in the ecosystem, including the downstream portion beyond our reporting visibility. This was supported by new share insights. Previously, we had relied primarily on lagging and incomplete market share surveys. But as the installed base of newer, connected toner-based products has increased and become more statistically significant in key geographies, we have gained incremental telemetry data. This new telemetry data indicated that HP's Supplies share, and particularly in our office business, was significantly lower than what we had assumed in our 4-box model. We have sized what the potential incremental inventory impact is in the ecosystem as well as changed our go-forward Supplies growth assumptions. As a result, as Dion described, we expect to lower the inventory in the entire ecosystem enabled by reducing our Tier 1 channel inventory. The impact of this action will create an approximately $100 million headwind to Supplies revenue for the remainder of FY '19 or roughly 1% of total Supplies revenue. We expect this impact, combined with the lower go-forward Supplies share and pricing assumption, to result in Supplies revenue decline of approximately 3% for the year. In addition, it is important that we tighten the levels of total inventory available in the ecosystem going forward. By doing this, pricing should improve. Therefore, we will be fine-tuning our operations and further reducing our channel inventory ceilings. Also, we need to enhance our business management system, including more telemetry data to improve the quality of our inputs. Our 4-box model is only as good as its assumptions. With some of our recent enhancements in both big data and software and an increasing installed base of newer, connected toner-based products, we expect to have an increasingly clearer picture of office supplies share.  The 4-box model remains our best predictor of Supplies demand. It does require a combination of data analytics and judgment to accurately forecast our Supplies results. Finally, it's important that we continue making the right returns-based investments, including the investments required to win back share. We have made good progress with previously implemented cost actions, which help support these investments, and we will continue to focus on a lean cost structure going forward. Now looking at the Print business overall, total Q1 revenue was $5.1 billion, flat year-over-year. Operating profit grew $22 million versus the prior year. And operating margin was 16.2%, up 50 basis points. The primary drivers of the year-over-year margin improvement were expense management, partially offset by unfavorable gross margin. Total hardware units were up 3%, with commercial units up 4% and consumer units up 2%. In calendar quarter 4, HP's market share was 41.1%, while the overall market declined. We continued to take advantage of opportunities to place NPV-positive units. Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Q1 cash flow from operations was $862 million, and free cash flow was $673 million. In Q1, the cash conversion cycle was minus 35 days. Sequentially, cash conversion cycle improved 3 days, with a 3-day increase in days payable outstanding, a 1-day increase in days sales outstanding and a 1-day decrease in days of inventory. We returned $720 million to shareholders through share repurchases and $249 million via cash dividends in Q1. Looking forward to the rest of FY '19, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. We continue to expect a headwind from currency. In Personal Systems, we expect CPU supply constraints through the first half of calendar 2019 with improvements in the second half. And we expect the cost from the overall basket of components and logistics to improve compared to Q1 levels. In print, we expect Supplies revenue to be approximately minus 3% for the remainder of the fiscal year. For corporate investments and other, we expect the quarterly run rate expense to be approximately $175 million per quarter. Also, as I have said before, we remain committed to driving productivity and investing for growth at the same time. Effective cost management remains a critical element of our success in very competitive markets, and we'll continue looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively. In addition, for the full year, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate, which is based on our long-term non-GAAP financial projection to be 16% in FY '19. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook. Q2 '19 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.53. Q2 '19 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.45 to $0.48. We are maintaining our full year fiscal 2019 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.12 to $2.22. We expect full year fiscal '19 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2 to $2.10 and full year free cash flow of at least $3.7 billion. We continue to expect to return approximately 75% of free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases over the course of the full year. And now let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And today's first questioner will be Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : I wanted to understand -- and you gave a lot of disclosure during the call on Supplies. But I guess, Dion, when you look at it, I mean, is this something that can be fixed to get back to flat? Is it -- I know it's secular. But one, I guess, would have thought with the copier initiative and what's going on in 3D Printing and some of the other growthier areas that you'd be able to offset some of the core pressures.  So I guess, maybe from a bigger picture standpoint, how are you thinking about this business over time? And should we think about it long term as something that's stable? Or will it just be sort of a constant decline? And then I have a follow-up. Dion Weisler : Great. Thanks, Shannon, for the question. I'll try to summarize it in terms of if we accept that, really it was a loss of share and, to a lesser extent, pricing, the question is, why we're losing share? And what are we going to do about it? It's true that these challenges versus third-party alternatives are not new. We're essentially fighting the same war, but we're now engaging on a new battlefield, and it's called online. Historically, we've been very strong in our traditional channels, including both retail and the commercial channel. You see, online offers a growing route to market for alternatives. And we're seeing more of our commercial customers moving to online, where our overall share, while still leading, is not as large. The growth of online and the access it enables for reman and aftermarket alternative is also creating incentives for aftermarket alternative manufacturers to invest in breaking in on better technology faster. And this has resulted in a faster deceleration in our aftermarket share on some newer platforms than we expected through this route to market. So while we've been expanding our presence in the omnichannel, we need to do it faster, and we need to do it more effectively. We need new weapons to fight on the new battlefield. We just can't bring a musket to a drone fight. So most importantly, what are we going to do about it? First, we need to continue to evolve our go-to-market and expand our online initiatives as well as our targeted marketing, and we'll certainly be doing that. The second thing we have to do is we've got to expand our order processes to protect our brand and discourage counterfeit and other IP infringements. We've got to support the value proposition of original supplies in terms of quality, sustainability as well as environmental impact. Thirdly, we have to shift our business models in order to diversify our product pool for services and securing a high share of the supplies for those units. Both Instant Ink and Managed Print Services are great examples of these models. And then finally, we've got to also evolve our business to include products that generate a larger portion of the lifetime profitability at the time of purchase. So we know the situation that we're in. We've named it, and we also know what we need to do about it. Shannon Cross : Okay. And then can you just talk maybe, Steve, a bit about cash flow? You maintained the cash flow. I know it's still early in the year. But given the pressure on Supplies, where are your other levers that you're going to be pulling? And how susceptible is it if we do see more of a PC slowdown? Just, I guess, your comfort level with the cash flow guidance. Steven Fieler : Yes. I guess, for starters, I am comfortable with the at least $3.7 billion. Similar to what we've done in prior quarters, when we look at our free cash flow outlook, we do take into account our forecast on earnings, our volume, especially in Personal Systems and cash conversion cycle. And then from an earnings perspective, while we do have the challenge in Supplies, we are taking actions, including cost actions, to address some of that. So net-net, on our earnings, volume and CCC perspective, I feel confident in the guide. And as I mentioned last quarter, worth repeating, we finished Q2 with a negative cash conversion cycle of minus 35 days compared to minus 32 days at the end of Q4. I'd acknowledge that we would likely have some upside to that minus 32 days at the end of last quarter. I still see that as potential upside, which helps further confirm and give confidence in the at least $3.7 billion number. Operator : And the next questioner today will be Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Wamsi Mohan : Dion, can you talk about why you're seeing this particularly in EMEA in Supplies and the risk that this spreads to other regions as well? And how confident are you about this prediction of 3% decline you -- and that you have actually captured an appropriate amount of data and telemetry that's guiding that given that this is not the first time that we'll see the Supplies reset? And I have one more question. Dion Weisler : Yes, no problems, Wamsi. I'll start, and I'm sure Steve may want to chime in as well. I guess, the underlying cause as we outlined during the call, was the surprise around our assumptions about share were wrong, and it was most specifically in EMEA. There are 2 main drivers that I'll comment on. The first is the omnichannel impact, and the second is our operational visibility. Let me start with the omnichannel. The omnichannel and the consumer preferences to buy online are definitely not new. What we've seen is more commercial customers purchasing online. And while our online business has been growing significantly and we have leading share online, it's at a lower percentage than our share with traditional commercial resellers and install retailers. Where we went wrong is that we had incorrect Supplies share assumptions in our 4-box model regarding the plans for Supplies selling in quarter 1 '19 and in prior quarters. This made it very difficult to spot the buying behavior change as a trend. It didn't necessarily all happen in Q1, but now that we understand the trend better, it has driven a change in our expectations for share going forward. In addition to that, the macro uncertainty has also increased, and we've seen further price sensitivity among customers pressuring both our share and our Supplies pricing. If I turn to operational issues, since we don't have much visibility into the downstream channel ecosystem and we were maintaining CI levels below our Tier 1 ceiling, we did not see clearly enough that we had an issue. However, we saw lower sell-through during the course of quarter 1 and adjusted our operational plans to reduce shipments, consistent with our Supplies sales model. We also received new share analytics. It's a really important point, and we were able to triangulate that our revised share assumptions were below our previous ones. And so in retrospect, when the new share insights are applied, we believe that our inventories in the ecosystem -- in the whole ecosystem began growing in prior quarters. However, the prior share assumptions made it hard to call this out as a trend as it was masking the underlying problem. And as a result of that, we've adjusted our go-forward 4-box assumptions and sizing inventory impact, as Steve talked about, to be approximately $100 million. Steven Fieler : So then I'll just add to that and address more specifically on the extent beyond EMEA and then even the sizing of that $100 million. So in Q1, certainly, the revenue weakness and the incorrect share assumptions were primarily in EMEA. And while the multi-tier channel dynamics that have been described are not unique to EMEA, they are more prevalent there. That said, the competitive trends are global, and both the changes in the customer buying with more commercial customers purchasing supplies online and the pricing that Dion just referred to are more macro in nature. And therefore, when we revisited our 4-box assumptions, we did look at all regions and revised our share and pricing accordingly, and that's all embedded in our guidance. And then specifically, I think you indicated this is what happened before. In terms of the channel itself, just to put context, we're talking roughly 1% of our total Supplies stream of over $13 billion. And while there are some things that are clear with data, there are others that we need to triangulate on. And we can't be precise on all fronts, especially because we don't have visibility into the entire downstream unmonitored ecosystem. So our approach here was to triangulate on a channel inventory number across the ecosystem by analyzing different data points. We compared our old share assumptions with the revised one that have been informed by big data, and we also looked at prior selling statistics and CI trends. We then estimated how much additional downstream channel inventory may exist, and we believe $100 million is the right estimate. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Appreciate that. And then if I could just quickly follow up. Can you talk about the longer-term print margin assumptions for the segment now, given that we're talking about some structural headwinds here on Supplies? Steven Fieler : Yes. So we obviously delivered 16.2% in the quarter. And when we entered FY '19, Dion and I had a good conversation. We actually took proactive steps to address some of the growing global uncertainty we saw at the time and began some targeted expense reductions. We didn't anticipate this Supplies challenge, but we saw, we reacted quickly and further tightened OpEx. It's important that we continue investing in the areas where we expect good returns, like our growth initiatives, placing the right units and evolving our business model to be more contractual. So that's important for us to continue. It is why, though, that we must continue to drive more productivity and more efficiency in the model. I do acknowledge that maintaining the 16% going forward is tougher, given the Supplies challenge, but it does remain our target. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Huberty : Just following up on the Printer Supplies discussion. It sounds like some of the visibility into market share came on the back of the telemetry data, which is something that you've talked about for a couple of years. Why this quarter did that show you a picture that actual market share was different than you thought? Why weren't the systems flagging that ahead of time? And do you have to invest in technology so that you can get better insights out of that data? And then I have a follow up. Dion Weisler : Thanks, Katy. To help you understand it better, let me explain a little bit about our methodology that drives the share assumptions we use on office supplies, which is primarily toner-based, and how it's changed. It's worth noting that it's different than ink-based products, where we've historically had more telemetry data. Previously, we had used periodic third-party survey data and market research aggregators to estimate toner supply shares. We did not have a statistically significant sample from the system telemetry and the instrumentation nor the capabilities to calculate share for toner-based products in the installed base. We've had this data for ink-based products, but due to the limited number of machines that were phoning home in commercial due to enterprise firewall constraints and otherwise unconnected devices, we've had to build the connected installed base over time. And so with the increasing mix of newer products and the growth of the connected installed base, combined with improvements in big data, we've been able to move to a better source of share data based on system telemetry. It's worth noting that the share we calculate through big data reflects the share at the time the customer hits the print button, which may be months after they actually purchase the supplies. So when the new share insights are applied, we believe that the inventory in the ecosystem had been growing during quarter 1 and previous quarters. And the combined effect of the change in market dynamics impacting share and the lack of visibility to the change resulted in excess HP supplies in the market and lower Tier 1 channel sell-through. Having said all that, we will obviously need to continue to refine the telemetry data and our instrumentation and business management system as we move forward. Kathryn Huberty : And then just shifting the discussion to PCs, how is the industry reacting to lower memory prices? Is that at all getting passed through in prices to customers? Or was holding onto the lower cost a contributor to the margin expansion for both you and some of your peers this quarter? Steven Fieler : Yes. When we looked at our margin in Q1 and certainly, the ASP portion of that, the large sort of greater than 50% increase in the ASPs was actually driven by mix, with the remainder being overall pricing dynamics. And we did see some favorability from Q4 to Q1. We'd expect continued favorability from Q1 to Q2 on the overall commodities. Exactly how this will play out in our margins going forward is going to depend, though, on overall market and pricing dynamics. Obviously, we've got currency volatility we continue to see, and likely headwinds from currency will partially offset some of the tailwinds we are seeing on commodity costs. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Your guidance for EPS for Q2 is a little bit -- the midpoint of it is a little bit below Street consensus. Should we interpret that as you're feeling now more confident in the low end of your EPS guidance, particularly in light of the Supplies news? Or do you believe that consensus has mismodeled seasonality for the year? And I have a follow-up, please. Steven Fieler : Yes. I think in general, our Q2 EPS guide is in line with normal seasonality. And I think the comment was on the full year, so maybe I'll comment on the full year and get back to Q2. Full year, we are maintaining our guide at $2.12 to $2.22 non-GAAP EPS. Confident we can deliver across the various puts and takes. We have factored in now the lower Supplies revenue; the CPU constraints, which we had already taken into account; and FX headwinds. We have multiple levers to offset. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to continue driving cost management whether they be in-flight initiatives that we can accelerate or continued push around digital transformation. I mentioned the components on the prior call -- or excuse me, prior question. And so how much of that sticks, again, is to be seen. So we do have levers. But if I reflect back at SAM when I laid out the FY '19 guidance and broke it up between the segments, which was about $0.05 to $0.12 of the year-over-year increase, and shares and other about $0.05 to $0.08 of the year-over-year increase, I think we're generally in line with that. On the segments, more strength in Personal Systems, and now we have some challenge on the Print overall. And on the corporate and other, have a year-over-year favorability on shares, to a lesser extent, OI&E. But we are investing more in corporate investments and other. So net-net, I feel confident holding the midpoint of our guide. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. And then just back to Supplies. So if Europe is a third of your business and was down 9%, that suggests that Supplies outside of Europe was down 0. And I guess, the question would be, why does the rest of the world not start to migrate towards sort of negative sell-through growth on a go-forward basis? And accordingly, why do you have confidence in minus 3% growth? Steven Fieler : Yes. So as I mentioned earlier, clearly the issue in Q1 was and pertained to EMEA. And even the share delta from the assumptions that we previously had to what we now view as our share was, primarily, the delta was in EMEA. That being said, we looked and reanalyzed the entire business across all regions. And the minus 3%, we believe, is a prudent guide. It does take into account both, number one, the channel inventory in the entire ecosystem. Again, it's about a point of it, the $100 million takedown. And the second is we did revise our shares and pricing assumptions worldwide. So net-net, we think that it's the right way to look at the business even though the issue in Q1 was primarily EMEA-based. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Steve Milunovich with Wolfe Research. Steven Milunovich : Just one question. In the past, at some of the SAM meetings, you've talked about $1 billion negative hit from commodity costs. I'm just curious, how much of a positive are you expecting this year in the swing? One would expect it could be quite substantial. You've also, in the past, talked about the ability to offset that by taking out $1 billion of costs annually in the business. And just said that's the normal course thing we have to do. Are you still on track to take out about $1 billion from the cost base? Steven Fieler : So let me respond to that. So on the first piece, actually, on a year-over-year basis, costs and commodity costs are still a headwind. Sequentially, they're a tailwind. But we're still, from a year-over-year basis, going through the period where costs had risen for some time. I think whether it be headwind or tailwind, I think the reality is that the market adjusts pretty rapidly to different changes in component costs and other short-term factors such as currency. So how much actually falls to the bottom line or how much we need to mitigate through additional productivity is very dependent upon the circumstances. In terms of the actual dollars that we're driving, we do remain on track to our productivity initiatives. It's an area where we'll continue to look to accelerate, candidly, given some of the Supplies challenges. But this is really in the DNA of HP, and I'm very confident in our ability to drive expense actions where we need to. Dion Weisler : And the only thing I would add to that is that we won't lead the market down on price. We obviously need to remain competitive in the marketplace, and we've been investing heavily in innovation and we believe our customers are valuing that innovation. And the demand signal for our products remains really strong. Operator : The next questioner today will be Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Roderick Hall : I just want to come back to the telemetry question and ask you if you could give us some idea where you are in the process of improving telemetry. So have you -- what kind of sample you have? So should we expect for you to continue to look at this and improve telemetry over time, and therefore, maybe come back to us and continue to adjust this inventory in the channel? Or is everything pretty much done now, and you wouldn't expect any changes? And then I have a follow-up. Steven Fieler : I guess, for starters, the 4-box model historically has been a relatively good predictor. And I think we need to acknowledge that it is not perfect. There is data and science. There is also judgment and art to it. And to your question, we do need to get better with the telemetry data. And also, we've -- bundled it up to more analytics and business management system in general. And so what it really depends upon, I would sort of call it, a few dimensions, it's really the quantity, quality and speed of the telemetry. And from a quantity perspective, it's installing and shipping more of our installed base with the kind of newer, toner-based telemetrics such as the JetIntelligence. But it's also ensuring that we have access to that. And so increasingly, the penetration of our installed base and quantity is important, but also then the quality and speed in which we can analyze this information, apply more predictive BI analysis around it. So we are investing in this, and I would expect it to get better over time. But I'd -- to my opening comments, we have been pretty good at predicting with the 4-box model, and this is fine-tuning. Dion Weisler : But with all that said and done, I think it's also important to note something I mentioned earlier. We need to shift our business models in order to diversify our profit pools through services and securing a higher share of the supplies for these units. And so I am encouraged by the work that we're doing around Instant Ink and growing our installed base there as well as Managed Print Services. They're great examples of that model. And secondly, what I talked about is we've got to evolve our business to include products that generate a larger portion of the lifetime profitability at the time of purchase. Roderick Hall : Okay. And then I wanted -- on the follow-up, I just wanted to come back to the cash flow guidance. And I guess, do you see if there's any way -- I guess, the issue -- it makes sense to us that you could take working capital out. But this is a year when Personal Systems, we're not expecting a lot of growth, whereas we've had double-digit growth the last couple of years. So it seems like a tougher year to take working capital out. So I just wonder if there's anything else you can do to help us bridge back to the cash flow guidance or is it just a case that the cash flow guidance is a little bit more aggressive, considering the underlying fundamentals? Steven Fieler : I already highlighted the likely improvement in cash conversion cycle, and that obviously brings cash into the current year. When the Personal Systems business grows sequentially, even if it's small growth, it does pull cash into that period. And so while we are not anticipating the growth that we have seen in prior years, we do -- we are factoring in what we think the revenue and volume trajectory is of Personal Systems. And as long as that business has sequential growth, it is a cash generator. Operator : And our last questioner today will be Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : Two if I could. Just going back to Supplies, Dion, is there any way for us to think about how you're thinking about what long-term, new normalized Supplies rates will be? And appreciate all the detail that you guys gave. But how should we be thinking about -- what's the best way for our models after '19 for us to be thinking about it, best you can tell right now? And then I have a follow-up. Dion Weisler : Look. First, as Steve alluded to in our outlook, we've taken into account the approximately $100 million headwind from reducing inventory in the Supplies ecosystem. This is about a point of Supplies revenue, as Steve highlighted. And the remainder of the decline is the base is really based on factoring in the revised share and the pricing assumptions. And future outlook beyond '19 will depend upon a number of things including the progress we're making across each of our 4-box drivers and the pace of our business model evolution that I referred to at the last question. So at this time, just as we ordinarily do, we're not going to comment about future years. Steven Fieler : And maybe to provide a little additional context, I'll just sort of give an update of where we are on the 4-box. Enrique shared at SAM what we thought the various 4-box arrows looked like. And if Enrique were doing that today, given the changes we've seen driven by the commercial channel and evolving marketplace Dion described, first, we wouldn't expect any changes to installed base or usage. Where we would expect some change is in office. Whereas we have previously had an arrow going up of gaining share, given the new data, we'd actually expect share to be down to a lesser extent on office. Pricing, which was a down arrow, driven by the mix more to A3, we offer additional commentary that there would be pricing pressures, again as we described on the call. On home, almost all the boxes will remain the same except for share, given that a smaller portion of home does have toner-based products. And so the share we have previously had going up, it would still be going up but not as, I guess, strong of an arrow going up, as we had said at SAM. Ananda Baruah : That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then just a quick follow-up. Reiterating the EPS guidance, should we think any differently now about the potential for the upper half of the range? My personal -- I mean, our assumptions were that you actually had a good chance to beat the EPS guidance previously. So maybe there's still a good degree of confidence to land the upper half as well. But how should we think about that where it stands today? That's it for me. Steven Fieler : Well, as always, we view and take a very prudent view to our guidance, taking into account all of the puts and takes and risks and opportunities that we see, and we provide a range around it. I'm not going to comment specifically other than we have a range, and we've got confidence we can deliver within it. Dion Weisler : And we'd held that range. Steven Fieler : Yes. Dion Weisler : So thank you, everyone, for taking the time to join us. We remain confident in our business. We're reaffirming our full year EPS and full year cash flow guidance. We're relentless in both managing our costs and reinvesting to create long-term value. We know we have work to do to manage through the current dynamics, and that's exactly what we're going to do and what you should expect from us. We'll continue to play a long game. We'll execute to our strategy with rigor and focus on driving sustainable, long-term earnings and cash flow growth. Thanks very much. Operator : And the conference has now concluded.

For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations. And now I'll turn it over to Dion. Dion Weisler : Thanks, Beth. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In Q2, as you can see from our results, we are delivering on our plans, demonstrating strong execution and progress on our priorities. Our strategy remains consistent : to engineer experiences that amaze while driving profitable growth. We are striking the right balance between driving results for today and investing for the long term. We're leading in our core PC and print markets while extending our portfolio of services and solutions in our growth and future categories. In the second quarter, revenue was $14 billion, up 2% in constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.53, up 10% and at the high end of our outlook range. Free cash flow was strong at $747 million, and we returned $936 million to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends. We continue to operate in a dynamic environment that includes ongoing industry component and strength as well as macroeconomic, geopolitical and tariff uncertainties. But we have a highly experienced team that know how to navigate through complex market conditions. Despite industry-wide issues, we will stay laser-focused on our strategy to drive long-term, sustainable performance, build trust in our brand and create shareholder value. Let me provide a few highlights and color on each of our businesses. We continue to execute well in Personal Systems. Revenue grew 5% in constant currency with strong operating margins of 4.3%. Innovation and design are setting our product mix apart, and we're making disciplined investments in solutions and demand generation. We continue to drive profitable growth through a relentless focus on customer insights and by aggressively pursuing targeted opportunities to go after the heat in the market. While PC growth across the industry was more subdued this quarter, HP continued to outperform the market and gain profitable share. Our Commercial portfolio remains strong, with growth in both commercial desktops and notebooks. As IT decision-makers look to create the office of the future, they are turning to HP to support their requirements for both manageability and security. For small and medium-sized businesses, we expanded our AMD portfolio with the launch of HP ProBooks, incorporating premium design and versatility. We also expanded on our premium offerings with the new Intel-based EliteBook 800, bringing robust security to mainstream business users. This includes HP Sure Sense, our new software that harnesses AI to detect and prevent malware threats. We also continued to raise the bar for gamers with new OMEN devices, software, displays and accessories. As any gamer will tell you, gaming is all about immersion, experience and competition. We are growing our ecosystem and setting new benchmarks for e-sports, including last week's launch of the OMEN X 2S, the world's first dual-screen gaming laptop. What makes this system special is that it enables multitasking for gamers to message, watch a Twitch stream or run other apps without ever having to take their eyes off the game. While we're growing our core, we're continuing to gain momentum in strategic growth areas, including Device as a Service and retail solutions. This quarter, we announced HP DaaS Proactive Security, a significant extension to HP's award-winning DaaS solution, providing the world's most advanced Windows 10 security service for files and browsing. And in our retail solutions business, HP Engage, our retail point-of-sale solution, was selected to power roughly 2,000 stores for one of the world's largest office product retailers. Shifting to Printing, we again outperformed the market in a challenging environment. Total revenue declined 2%, and as expected, Supplies declined 3%. In Supplies, we are taking decisive action. We have made and continued to make improvements in our business management systems and to enhance our measurements of the market and our performance. We are simplifying and strengthening our pricing discipline to achieve consistency of our value proposition. Also in Q2, we increased both our brand protection activities and our online marketing with a focus on search and demand generation. Finally, growing our contractual businesses and evolving our business models remain key strategic initiatives. In hardware, revenue growth in Commercial was offset by weaker consumer demand. Not all hardware is created equal, and we are focused on shifting the installed base to more productive and profitable units. In Q2, we saw Commercial revenue growth in A3 and A4 enterprise. We also introduced a new generation of OfficeJet Pro products and reimagined the print experience for the way small and medium-size businesses and employees are printing. Our design team connected with thousands of small business owners across the globe to create a product that meets their unique needs. Built with sustainability in mind, it incorporates best-in-class security and a new smart task workflow solution into a printer that is 39% smaller than the previous generation. This was the insight required to fit into today's smaller and more versatile workspaces. Turning towards the contractual marketing, including A3, we continue to make progress and are leveraging our differentiated technology and IP to capture opportunities. In Q2, we won several large Managed Print Service contracts, including a multimillion-dollar deal with Petrobras to provide a comprehensive portfolio of solutions and services, including our A3, DesignJet and PageWide products. And in graphics printing, we extended the business into a natural adjacency, opening an entirely new market for us with the launch of the HP Stitch portfolio. These digital textile printers are specifically designed for sportswear, interior decor and soft signage applications. HP Stitch builds on HP's leadership in inkjet technology with precise color matching and cost-efficient, streamlined production capabilities. Turning to 3D Printing. This month, we expanded our portfolio with the introduction of our most advanced Multi Jet Fusion systems to date, the Jet Fusion 5200. By bringing together innovations in systems, data intelligence, software and material science, we are able to deliver new levels of manufacturing predictability and applications potential. And we are excited that companies like Jaguar Land Rover are early users of this new system. Of course, transformation of large manufacturing industries doesn't happen in isolation. Our customers are looking for complete solutions that integrate into their long-term manufacturing road maps and existing processes. This month, we announced industrial alliances with Siemens and BASF. We will deliver an end-to-end digital manufacturing solution that integrates HP's 3D Printing portfolio with Siemens' digital industry's offering from 3D design to simulation, production, factory planning and analytics. Together, we will be working with automotive and industrial companies to transform their manufacturing with existing customers, including Volkswagen. Finally, I want to spend a moment on an exciting announcement we made just this week. HP and SmileDirectClub, the leader in teledentistry, announced a milestone partnership to reinvent the orthodontics industry. To keep up with demand and accelerate their growth, SmileDirectClub will be deploying a fleet of 49 HP 3D Printing systems to produce more than 50,000 unique molds per day, one of the largest 3D printing projects in the United States. This is truly industrial-scale 3D production. Together, these are all significant steps for our 3D Printing business. Our expanded portfolio, materials and industrial alliances enable us to serve a growing range of customers with a diverse range of manufacturing needs. We are well positioned within the digital manufacturing industry and are helping to ignite the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Overall, I'm pleased with our Q2 results. We remain focused on driving great innovation, disciplined execution and prudent cost management. We remain agile and adaptable in the face of volatility in an ever-changing landscape. We will continue to execute today while we invest in our growth and future businesses. With that context, I'm going to turn it over to Steve for a closer look at the numbers. Steven Fieler : Thanks, Dion. In Q2, we demonstrated resilience and overall delivered a solid quarter. We grew revenue in constant currency. We grew operating profit dollars, and non-GAAP EPS grew double digits. We see opportunities ahead as well as ongoing uncertainties and remain focused on executing our long-term strategy as we navigate in a dynamic environment. In the second quarter, net revenue was $14 billion, flat or up 2% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas declined 1%, EMEA was up 2%, and APJ grew 11%. Gross margin was 19.4%, up 10 basis points year-over-year. Sequentially, gross margin was up 1.6 percentage points, in line with normal seasonality, driven by both rate and mix improvement. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.7 billion, up 1%, driven by an increase in SG&A. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $60 million for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.53, up $0.05 or 10% with a diluted share count of approximately 1.5 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes amortization of intangible assets of $29 million, acquisition-related charges of $11 million, restructuring and other charges of $69 million, nonoperating retirement-related credits of $10 million, tax adjustments resulting in a benefit of $43 million, and a tax-related impact on all of these items. As a result, Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.51. At the segment level, in Personal Systems, we are executing well and delivering a consistent, profitable growth. I am pleased with the team's ability to remain focused on our long-term strategy while navigating each quarter in a highly dynamic market environment. Total Personal Systems revenue in the second quarter was $8.9 billion, up 2% and up 5% in constant currency. Operating margins improved 50 basis points to 4.3%, driven by improved mix, which we view as more structural as well as better rates, largely a result of supply chain cost favorability, partially offset by unfavorable currency. Our Q2 results reflect our ability to manage through a constrained CPU environment, segment our markets, identify areas of profitable growth and make trade-offs as appropriate. By customer segment, Commercial revenue was up 7%. Consumer revenue declined 9%, driven by overall market softness. By product category, revenue was up 7% for Desktops, up 6% for Workstations and down 1% for Notebooks. Overall, in calendar quarter 1, our market share was 23.2%, up 0.5 point year-over-year, and demand for our products remain strong. Turning to Printing. Our reinvention journey continues as we outperform our respective markets, continue to target growth opportunities and make progress addressing challenges in our core. Revenue was $5.1 billion in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year nominally and in constant currency. Commercial hardware revenue growth was more than offset by declines in Consumer hardware and Supplies. Hardware units were down 4%, with Consumer and Commercial categories down 4% and 3%, respectively. Having said that, we outperformed the market, gaining share in the calendar first quarter in both our home and office businesses and in key segments, including A3. We continue to make progress in our contractual offering. This includes strong growth in Instant Ink, where we're growing revenue in our global subscriber base, and in MPS, where we continue to grow revenue as well. In Q2, Supplies revenue was down 3% nominally and in constant currency. We continue to operate below our Tier 1 channel inventory ceiling. As Dion just described, we are taking several actions in this business. As part of our business management system, we are implementing programs to enhance our visibility in the downstream channel. We have made initial progress lowering Tier 1 channel inventory, but there's still more progress to be made over the next 2 quarters, particularly in Tier 2 in the downstream ecosystem. We still anticipate Supplies revenue will decline approximately 3% in constant currency for the full year. In print, operating margins expanded 40 basis points to 16.4%, driven by spend favorability as we balance tight expense management with continued strategic investments in key growth initiatives, including 3D. Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Q2 cash flow from operations was $861 million, and free cash flow was $747 million. In Q2, the cash conversion cycle was minus 32 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle weakened 3 days. The change was primarily driven by a 4-day increase in accounts receivables, which was impacted by revenue linearity. We saw a 1-day increase of days of inventory and a 2-day increase in accounts payable. We returned over 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in the quarter. This included $691 million for share repurchases and $245 million via cash dividends. For the full year, we still expect to return approximately 75% of free cash flow to shareholders. Looking forward to the second half of FY '19. Keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook : We expect an increased headwind from currency. We have incorporated the impacts from tariffs currently in place, including the increase from 10% to 25% implemented earlier this month, but we have not included the impact for any future tariffs. In Personal Systems, we expect CPU supply constraints to continue through the third calendar quarter. Also, as I have said before, we remain committed to driving productivity and investing for growth at the same time. Effective cost management remains a critical element of our success in very competitive markets. And we'll continue looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively. In addition, for the full year, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate, which is based on our long-term non-GAAP financial projection, to be 16% in FY '19. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook : Q3 '19 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.56; Q3 '19 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.52. We are updating our full year fiscal 2019 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.14 to $2.21, and full year fiscal '19 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.04 to $2.11. So now let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today will be Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva : And I'll ask both my questions at the same time, and you can do them in any order. And they're pretty simple. While you updated your EPS guidance, I don't believe in the slides or your prepared comments you mentioned free cash flow changes. Just help us bridge that. And then more importantly, now that we've driven past the hiccups of the 4-box model and the ink supplies that you've had challenges with, can you give us a backward looking -- as we progress through that, what exactly, looking back, happened? What you've learned? And have fully overcome those speed bumps? And how should we think about the 4-box model? Like did you have to put in a couple of variable -- new variables or adjustments now that it looks like you've made progress? How should we think about what you've learned from that as we all learned in life all the time? Steven Fieler : Jim, let me address the free cash flow question first. So we have not always updated our free cash flow guide on particular earnings calls, but I will confirm that we are still expecting to achieve $3.7 billion or greater for the full year in cash flow. And the assumptions are pretty straightforward similar to prior quarters. First of all, just to remind everyone, we do expect over time that free cash flow to grow in line with earnings, and we're taking into account our earnings for the year, our cash conversion cycle and volume. And when I look at first half of the year, we did deliver $1.4 billion of free cash flow and that would leave $2.3 billion in the back half of this year. We actually achieved $2.3 billion in FY '18 and $2.2 billion in FY '17. So this is very consistent to where we've been in prior years. And really, the assumption is around I would expect that there would be some upside favorability to the cash conversion cycle, which ends at minus 32 days in Q2, and also that we would expect to see the normal Personal Systems volume in the second half, which is higher than the first half. So that's on the free cash flow. Dion, do you want to comment on where we're on Supplies? I can add to it if you need. Dion Weisler : Yes, absolutely. And Jim, thanks for the question. I can assure you that we are all over this, as you can imagine. We're taking very decisive actions on the plans that we outlined last quarter. I think we were very detailed in how we thought about last quarter and how we explained really 6 themes, 4 operational themes and 2 strategic initiatives that we needed to drive. Since then, I've put a Supplies task force as well as a global program office in place with a primary focus on EMEA and then to ensure consistency across all of the regions. We've identified and began implementing several changes already. I'll walk you through where we are on the 4 operational issues and the 2 strategic areas, the focus that I outlined on quarter 1 and then I'll have Steve chime in as well. So first, let me start with the operational actions. We're making changes in our marketing and go-to-market to address our supply share and you'll recall that was really where we primarily deviated from a 4-box model last quarter. We've increased our investment in search significantly versus last year in all regions. And we've improved our search coverage in the main markets within EMEA. We've also changed our marketing mix with key online marketplaces to improve the prioritization of HP original supplies. Secondly, we're upping our game in terms of brand protection. We're going to defend our brand as well as our intellectual properties to ensure that our customers receive the quality, the benefits, the sustainability and environmental advantages that original HP Supplies provide. Thirdly, we're working with our Tier 2 channel partners to gain more visibility into the overall the overall Tier 2 channel inventory and to reduce the overall level of inventory. And fourthly, we're bolstering our business management systems. For example, we're improving our pricing discipline, and we are continuing to enhance our data management. We're leveraging the big data on the telemetry information that we're now collecting, and we're doing that across the installed base of printers that we outlined in Q1 to provide more accurate and timely reporting and insight.  Regarding the 2 strategic areas of focus. Firstly, as we actually discussed at SAM and on prior calls, we're evolving in print to focus on driving growth in our contractual business, certainly where our customers are really interested in transacting with us through those contractual motions. And then finally, we're adopting new business models to continue to drive long-term value in print. And Steve, with that, it's probably a good idea to provide some additional color on the progress in channel inventory and in other areas. Steven Fieler : Yes. Maybe -- I guess I'll add to that. And Jim, just to kind of remind us that what we identified in Q1 kind of relative to the assumptions we had in our model, where we had inaccurate assumptions were primarily around share, I think, which Dion just addressed in his remarks; and then to a lesser extent, pricing. And so there are a lot of, let's call them, sort of forecast changes we're making to better analyze share from the telemetry that Dion mentioned, also online and other customer analytics. And then from a channel inventory perspective, we are making good progress bringing on the channel inventory, as we mentioned on the last call. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Huberty : We've spoke with companies that aren't even halfway through their required refresher upgrade to Windows 10. And so how significant could the commercial PC demand be in the back half of the year? And should we think about that as a more protected IT project versus some of the areas where we're hearing about pushouts? Then I have a follow-up. Steven Fieler : Yes. So I won't make any specific kind of revenue guide counter, but I will say in general that what we're seeing in the market -- and I think it's generally in line with what the industry analysts are saying as well is that we have a more favorable Commercial market and a softer Consumer one. And we have seen strength in Commercial and are expecting a bit of a tailwind and lift from the Win 10 refresh in the second half of the year and even directionally beyond this year. The Win 10 migration has been executed, let's call it, I guess, a bit more smoothly than the prior rollover period. So do not expect a significant trough in 2020. So it is a driver of some of the Commercial demand we're seeing. Kathryn Huberty : And Steve, I assume that, that also plays into the confidence around the cash conversion cycle? Steven Fieler : It does. I mean the -- again, a big assumption is, you can call it normal seasonality with better second half, and Personal Systems will be higher than the first half. And that is driven by some strength we see in Commercial, which is partially offset by some of the Consumer softness. Dion Weisler : And what I've been really impressed with, Katy, is being this relentless focus on customer insight and turning that insight into innovation. I think the Personal Systems team and Alex and together with the regions have really listened to our customers. The -- we continue to launch incredible products. We know there is an incredible area of concern around cyber, and it's front and center within the portfolio. And as a result of that, we're seeing really strong demand for our products, particularly in the Commercial space. Kathryn Huberty : And then what is the impact from tariffs that you've baked into the full year guide? And what mitigating actions are you taking around the manufacturing footprint and any new pass-through pricing? Dion Weisler : It's a great question, Katy, and if you're watching CNBC today, you would have seen that they were asking that question relentlessly. So let me kind of bifurcate my answer on tariffs into 2 portions. The first is the current tariffs that we know about. Our guidance includes the impact of the tariffs that are currently in place, including the increase from 10% to 25% that went into effect earlier this month. So here, I'm referring to that roughly $200 billion trade tariff list. Regarding the new list that was published earlier this month, clearly, it's an industry-wide situation in the U.S. that has continued to be very dynamic, and so we don't speculate or comment on potential impacts until we know all the facts. And we're still hopeful an agreement will be reached. And the reason I say that is because it's really highly uncertain. First of all, we don't know if the additional tariffs will happen at all. Secondly, if they do happen, we don't know when that would be -- when that would happen, and the timing on that really does make a big difference. And thirdly, we don't know what the final list of products will be, what will be included, what may be excluded. And finally, we don't know how much or what the tariff rates would be. So I know that's quite a few variables, and all of those variables can change the calculus quite significantly. And we've seen that in the past as we've worked through the first $200 billion list of tariffs. We've seen those variables in play. There have been multiple phases. They've been products that have been on the list and excluded from the list, and there have been changes to the tariff rates over time. So we continue to assess the potential impact to the business, and we're very active. We are not sitting idly by. We're looking at multiple scenarios. And we're working with the U.S. administration, we're working with others in the industry, and we're working with our supply chain on mitigations to ensure the best outcome for our ecosystem of customers and partners as well as our shareholders. So clearly, the implementation of incremental tariffs on the complete list of products imported from China would have industry-wide impacts. The impact would likely be more felt in the near term. And Steve, you might have some additional comment. Steven Fieler : Yes. In terms of the levers, we do have a number of levers that we would expect to use to mitigate the growth exposure from these tariffs down to a net exposure. This does include optimizing our manufacturing facilities around the world, adjustments to pricing and other items. We would plan to use these mitigations to drive down, again, to a net impact. I do want to emphasize -- or reemphasize what Dion said, because the specifics are absolutely essential around any assumptions or any quantification of what the net impact could be. We are assuming, however -- and these were the scenarios we're working through, that we would experience more of a shorter-term impact that would diminish over time. And to be clear, again, our guidance, both the EPS and free cash flow, does include impacts of the tariffs currently in place but not any contemplation of the additional tariffs under consideration. Operator : And the next questioner will be Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : You talked a lot on the last earnings call about this increased reception to purchasing remanufactured supplies online particularly in Europe. And I think a widespread investor concern is, do you believe that that's a structural issue now that you've had 90 more days to think and look and gather data on it? So specifically, are you seeing any evidence that -- of that occurring in other geographies? And you talked about some new inputs into the 4-box model around price and share. So given those inputs and given whether you consider a remand -- increased remand to be structural or cyclical, what is your belief for what normalized Supplies growth should be going forward? And do you actually reach that in 2020? Dion Weisler : Right. Thanks, Toni. Thanks for the question. I'll take the first one, and Steve, you might want to take the second. So if I catch you correctly, your -- to paraphrase it, the Supplies online issues spreading into other regions, i.e., Americas or APJ. As we said in the last call, the underlying factors around the shift to online and contractual are absolutely global in nature. And we live in a very connected world. Both Americas and APJ both begun addressing these trends earlier than EMEA did. Therefore, our primary focus remains EMEA. That said, the competition doesn't stand still and neither will we. We're sharing the learnings from the global task force with the other regions to ensure a consistent approach. As we will continue to monitor these trends in every single region, we'll fine-tune, we'll adjust as the market conditions will inevitably evolve. That's why I have a global program management office around this and we are looking at this from a global perspective, but the real primary focus remains in EMEA because Americas and APJ got started earlier. Steven Fieler : Toni, the specific -- I'm going to give you numbers. So maybe starting with Q2, our Q2 result of minus 3% was something that's in line with our expectations. And a similar trend is Q1. The decline was driven primarily from EMEA. I would say broadly speaking, our forecast assumptions are holding as we look into the remainder of '19. There is no change to our full year outlook. We're still expecting approximately minus 3% in constant currency. This would include the remaining takedown of the channel inventory and also the revised share and pricing assumptions described on the last call. It is difficult to pinpoint the precise timing of all the reduction between Q3 and Q4, so it could be some slight quarterly growth rate variability along with other natural business movements. It's all too dependent on the timing of the actions and how they play through the ecosystem. In regards to -- I guess beyond FY '19, it's going to depend on multiple factors and multiple variables and the progress we're making around installed base and the type of units we're placing, usage, the share and pricing as well as any evolution in our business model. And so I'm not going to comment any more specifically on FY '20 or beyond at this point. Toni Sacconaghi : But just a follow-up, Steve, I mean if you're explicitly saying that you made a change in share and price assumption in your 4-box model, I presume both of those were not positive. They were negative. And so if that's the case, then why wouldn't the structural longer-term Supplies growth rate be lower than what you had thought before? And why -- if you're taking down all the inventory, why wouldn't we be at that normalized rate in 2020? Steven Fieler : Well, you're correct that the assumptions -- change in assumptions were to the negative. We did bring down our share assumptions for the remainder of this year as well as pricing. That's not to suggest that the actions that Dion described can't move those in either direction. And ideally, we're working to move those up and to have share, win back programs as well as to drive more consistent pricing across the ecosystem, including the omnichannel. And so those are the actions we're working clearly to make sure we're addressing the Supplies headwinds we're facing this year. Dion Weisler : And that's really, Toni, why I break the actions down into operational issues, which we do expect to have an impact on those levers as well as the longer-term strategic focus areas, evolving our print focus, driving more towards contractual business and adopting new business models within the print business unit. Operator : And the next questioner today will be Steve Milunovich with Wolfe Research. Steven Milunovich : Hewlett Packard Enterprise just indicated that they've been seeing fairly recently, I guess maybe over the last 4 to 6 weeks, a slowdown in business, maybe a shifting out of business into the next quarter. Are you seeing anything like that? It doesn't look like you're seeing it on the PC side, but I would think on the commercial printer side, you might have some sense of that. So are you sensing that larger accounts are taking longer to close? Steven Fieler : We saw strength in Commercial. So I wouldn't highlight anything beyond that strength in Commercial. Steven Milunovich : Okay. And Steve, you talked about trying to front-end-load printer revenue a little bit more. Beyond contractual, are there other things that you're thinking you can do? And how significant could that be and how long might it take? Steven Fieler : So when I sort of made the comment on new business model evolution, there are sort of multiple dimensions to that. I think the primary one we've been focused on, what you alluded to, is the shift to contractual. And so we've been at that for some time and continue to make progress around our management services revenue as well as shifting more to Instant Ink, which continues to grow for the company. So I think that's been our primary driver. In terms of the sort of -- where the profit and the lifetime value of our hardware unit is, we already are operating in certain geographies where we do have printers that generate more profit of the lifetime upfront. And so I think we'll continue to work on different areas and different models in the future, but there's really not a whole lot more to describe at this point. Operator : And the next questioner today will be Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Paul Coster : Two questions in view of the tariffs. I'm wondering if you've identified any vulnerabilities or risks in your supply chain and whether there's any major sort of reconfigurations that you anticipate. How, if at all, that should mitigate the risk there? And the second one, just quick update on the metals printing and 3D Printing, if you can give us some sense of the time line again. Dion Weisler : Look, we have manufacturing facilities, as you can imagine, all over the world, and we're always working to optimize our manufacturing footprint. So this is just an ongoing part of our business so that we are not single-point sensitive. So that's how I think you should think about our manufacturing footprint and our facilities. As it relates to metals, look, I'm really happy with the progress of the 3D Printing business unit on multiple dimensions, not just the metals dimension for which they've made really good progress. We have some several companies like GKN that we're working with to serve the auto industry. We have similar efforts underway in the health care industry. But we continue to perform well in the 3D Printing business. We recently announced that over 10 million parts were produced using our 3D Printing technology last year, with half of the parts manufactured for end-user products. In -- quarter 2 was a busy quarter. We launched our new HP Jet Fusion 5200 series, which is a printing platform that delivers improved economics and performance and part quality, really designed for manufacturing. We also launched a new TPU material. And for those of you that want to geek out with me here, it really enables new classes of applications ideal for flexible and elastic parts. We also expanded our alliances with BASF, Materialise and Siemens, a very important announcement with Siemens just last week. And really, they're at the epicenter of all manufacturing. If you want to get into manufacturing processes, you need to be doing that with companies that have been doing it for decades, and Siemens is an industry leader. We also announced last week a major, incredible partnership between HP and SmileDirectClub, who's the leader in teledentistry, and they're really set to disrupt the orthodontics industry. SmileDirectClub will be deploying a fleet of 49 HP 3D Printing systems, produce more than 50,000 unique and highly personalized molds a day. And that's one of the largest 3D Printing manufacturing projects in the United States, and that's a true example of an industrial-scale 3D production. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Matthew Cabral : On Personal Systems, just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the impact of component costs particularly given some of the renewed declines in DRAM and just if you happen to pass that through versus the ability to drop some of that down to the bottom line. Steven Fieler : Yes. Yes. I think broadly speaking, we have seen some easing around the overall supply chain cost in the basket of kind of commodities and logistics. That being said, given the current currency environment and volatility we're seeing in the strengthening of the dollar, we've seen much of that offset. And kind of even looking forward, likely, the increased headwinds will continue to be an offset of some of the changes we've seen in the overall supply chain costs. So exactly how this is going to play out in the next quarter or quarters to come will really depend upon overall market and competitive dynamics as we've got some puts and takes as it relates to the overall cost on the Personal Systems side. Matthew Cabral : Got it. And then on Printing, just wondering if you could provide an update on how the Apogee acquisition is playing out so far and just what the learnings from that mean for your wider distribution strategy as you push more towards A3 over time. Dion Weisler : Look. Let me start out by mentioning it's now been several quarters since the acquisition of Apogee. And while we're running it as a stand-alone business from a go-to-market perspective, it's very much aggregated into our overall OPS business unit. I'll also remind you that Apogee enables HP to gain access to new profit pools by expanding our ability to deliver value-added services, and then it accelerates the deployment of what we know is superior technology into the growing contractual office printing market, especially among SMBs. The transaction augments our existing go-to-market channels, and it enhances our ability to deliver solutions and services that are necessary to win in the contractual market. This is all on point and on strategy, and more and more customers are shifting to contractual. So we feel, as we did when we made the acquisition, that this is absolutely leading us in the right direction. Operator : And the next questioner today will be Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : I also have 2. I guess the first is, can you talk a little bit -- you mentioned uncertainty in the environment, which just makes sense these days. But can you provide some more details on what you're seeing geographically in terms of demand and specifically maybe what you're seeing in China with regard to U.S. brands? And then I have a follow-up. Steven Fieler : Look, I'll give a first stab. So what we saw in our results in constant currency was Americas was down 1%, EMEA up 2%, and APJ up 11%. In Americas, I think we saw -- the driver there was primarily on the Personal Systems business. And candidly, I think that was driven by the industry-wide supply constraints we had and how we ultimately allocated a product. And I think that was the largest driver in the Americas. I think we're seeing different geographic pockets of strength in those that are softening and maybe Dion with a comment on China specifically. Dion Weisler : Yes. Look -- yes, I think we've experienced some recent slowing in our China business. And having said that, I think it's important to mention that we can't conclude that, that slowdown that we are seeing is solely related to any of the discussions that are currently underway. China has been and continues to be a strategically important market for us. We have a really strong brand in the country, and we've been there for decades. The geopolitical environment remains, let's call it, dynamic, and we'll continue to assess and respond to the situation and the potential impact to our business. That said, we continue to drive insight-driven innovation to our portfolio. That's one of the ways in which we go about running our business. It's through local insights and local product development. For example, in China, gaming has been a great success for us, including the most recent launch of our dual-screen OMEN gaming laptop, which we launched globally out of China. It's also worth noting our APJ region, just as Steve mentioned, as a whole, grew 11% in constant currency in quarter 2 against that backdrop of a slowing business in China. So we're seeing, for example, other areas within APJ, like Japan, being particularly strong. Shannon Cross : And then maybe Dion, if you can talk a little bit about the relationship with Canon. I'm just curious, do you feel like you're working more closely with them given some of the pressures on toner and the need to reposition against the aftermarket? And do you think they're reacting as aggressively as you'd like from a litigation standpoint? Because I know they have started talking about it a bit more than they had historically. Dion Weisler : Yes. Look, Shannon, as you know -- you've been following us a long time, we have an incredibly close, 35-year partnership with Canon, and I think it is stronger now than it has ever been. I just came back from Japan a couple of weeks ago and met with Mitarai-san. Clearly, aftermarket alternatives is not what we would want, either of us. And we're working very closely together to really think through the multidimensional levers that we have available to us. And I think both companies are being appropriately aggressive. Operator : And the next questioner today will be Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Roderick Hall : I just wanted to drill into the consumer PC deterioration, net revenue down 9%. It was up by 1% last quarter. And I just wondered if maybe you can comment on, regionally, where you saw that. And maybe we can tie it back to your other comments but I'd love it if you would give us some color. And also, just comment on whether you think that in those regions, you're seeing -- I heard you talk about Asia and China in particular, Dion, but just kind of what you're seeing from a consumer demand point of view across the globe? Dion Weisler : Look, I'll take a first stab. Steve might want to chime in. I guess on a macro level, there's been volatility in the market, and that causes uncertainty around the world. And in this type of environment, consumers tend to react more quickly to market conditions both on the positive side and on the negative side versus commercial customers, which has less sensitivity to the short term. The current environment has seen some slowing in Consumer in varying levels by country, and it will take us a long time to go through every single country. But it does vary country by country. We continue to innovate. That's the most important point. We need to continue to innovate with our products, like the Tango X in the Printing side of the business and the Spectre Folio in the Personal Systems, just to name 2 examples. And when we do that, we're giving consumers a reason to purchase, because they only do that when they have great innovation. So while we broadly agree with the industry views that both PCs and print are flattish markets over the mid- to long term, we'll continue to play our own game. We'll segment the market then we'll segment it again. We'll find the heat in the market, and we'll focus on outperforming the market. That's exactly what we've been doing and what you can expect us to do. Steven Fieler : Maybe one other small comment to add is our Consumer performance is really in line with the market. Operator : And our next questioner today will be Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : Just 2, if I could, real quick, and they're sort of partial clarification. Just going back to the supply dynamics, do you feel that you've fully identified the problem areas such that you have your arms completely around the dynamics that manifested last quarter? And if not yet, what remains to be done? How long until you think you'd do? I just want to make sure I'm fully understanding where you are with it. And then I have a quick follow-up as well. Steven Fieler : So the short answer is yes. We -- as Dion said, we put a task force of our most talented individuals. Both Dion and I have spent time in EMEA, and I think Dion described some of the actions we're doing. We would expect that these actions and in particular the impact on the overall channel inventory levels, which I sized at approximately $100 million, including the downstream, that those channel inventories would be reduced through this year. Ananda Baruah : Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And then a quick follow-up. I believe your comment around chipset constraints was into 3Q. Does that imply that you think after 3Q, you'll actually start to get some relief? And any context there in addition would be helpful with that. Dion Weisler : Look, I guess you are referring to the fairly well-known Intel shortage, which has come along with chipsets that go with it. I'd start by saying it's probably not fair or appropriate for me to second-guess the supply updates that Intel has provided over the past several weeks. Based on the most recent update from Intel, we continue to expect supply constraints through calendar quarter 3 just as we had through calendar quarter 2 and calendar quarter 1. I think you've seen us optimize as best we can on behalf of our customers and partners. The demand is really strong for our products, particularly in Commercial. And we'll continue to work closely with Intel to ensure that we drive the best outcomes. So thank you all for taking the time to be with us. We're at the bottom of the hour. Let me end the call where I began. We're delivering on our plan, and we're striking the right balance between driving performance for today as well as investing for the long term. While we will always have more work to do, we're making good progress against our priorities. We'll continue to put our customers at the center of everything we do and we will remain consistent and true to our strategy to engineer experiences that amaze while driving profitable growth. And I have a high degree of confidence that we'll continue to execute on that strategy with rigor and focus. So thank you very much for joining us today. Operator : And the conference has now concluded. Thank you all for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect your lines.",

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We have a lot to talk about today, and I want to start with the topic that I'm sure is most on your minds. As you've seen, I will be stepping down as President and CEO of HP. This is a decision I made following a great deal of reflection, and it's among the hardest choices I've ever had to make. There is nothing more important to me than my family, and I'm making a personal decision to return to Australia to tend to a family health matter. Serving as CEO of this great company for the past 4 years and having the opportunity to work alongside a truly incredible team has been the honor of my career. I also feel privileged that we have such an incredibly strong bench of capable leaders and robust succession planning at every level of the organization. The HP Board has had a rigorous succession planning process since day 1 of our company, and this process led the Board to exactly the right leader to usher in the next era of HP. After a thorough review and careful consideration of a full bench of external and internal candidates, I rest easy knowing that the company I love is in the best of hands with Enrique as the next CEO. As you spend time with Enrique and get to know him as I have, you will see why he is uniquely positioned and exactly the right leader HP needs to build on the company's progress and capitalize on future opportunities. Enrique began his career 30 years ago as an HP intern and spent decades becoming one of the company's most accomplished, multifaceted leaders. From his engineering roots and expertise across the Print, Personal Systems and service organizations to leadership roles at a country, region and worldwide level, Enrique is relentlessly dedicated to serving customers and partners and passionate about next-generation innovation. Since I arrived at HP 7 years ago, I've seen what Enrique is made of. He combines the strategic acuity and operational rigor needed to be a great executive with the passion for people and deep sense of purpose needed to be a trusted leader. I personally benefited immensely from his leadership during the separation of Hewlett-Packard Company in 2015, when we spent many long days together setting HP on its current course. Enrique brought incredible vision to our separation management office and was a key architect of one of the largest and most complex corporate separations in business history. He then operationalized the strategy that transformed HP's cost structure while simplifying the organization and creating the capacity to invest in innovation and drive profitable growth. More recently, Enrique has led a comprehensive global review of HP strategy and business operations, working directly with our Board to define our future operating model and prioritize initiatives that maximize shareholder value. Just like at separation, he's bringing incredible vision and energy to this work and I know it will open exciting new doors for our company. You will no doubt be spending a lot of time with Enrique, but I invited him to our call today to say a few brief words before we dig into our Q3 results. Enrique? Enrique Lores : Dion, let me start by thanking you for everything you have done for our company. I have worked for 9 CEOs during my career in HP, and you reflect the values of our founders and our company better than anyone. Your leadership has been a source of strength, and it has positioned HP well for the future. I'm grateful for all the time we have spent working together side by side, and I look forward for our continued partnership over the coming months. I know I speak for everyone at HP when I say that we will always heed your advice to keep raising the bar. You will always be the first CEO of HP Inc. I also want to thank HP's Board of Directors for the confidence they have placed in me, and I would like to thank the extended HP team for their support and key contributions. 30 years ago, I was an engineering student in Spain. A group of HP engineers came to my school to share their passion for a printer. I have never seen anyone so passionate about a product and now are changing the world through innovation. It opened my eyes to new and wonderful possibilities. It taught me that imagination has no limit, and it inspired me to join this company. Today, I continue to be inspired by this company and our unique ability to bring out the best of humanity through the power of technology. Each day, our people across the company are constantly creating game-changing innovation that pushes the limits of human potential. Our opportunities to grow digital manufacturing and graphics printing redefine the model of computing and transform print [indiscernible]. This is the magic of HP, and it is why I'm so excited about our future.  In separation, we have built on the foundational strength of HP, which include our powerful portfolio, operational excellence, rigorous cost management and purpose-driven culture. Yet as far as we have come, I believe we have great opportunities to do more and to continue our innovation journey. An important part of our strategy is to focus on delivering short-term results and setting the company up for success in the long term. As part of the review I have been leading with the Board, we focused on growth but also in simplifying our operating model, evolving our business model and driving significant improvement in our cost structure. Our end objective is to create a more digitally-enabled, customer-centric organization. It's critical that we do so, because the needs of our customers are rapidly changing, and we must become a more agile organization that is trying to fully capitalize on the opportunities ahead. I have great confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable returns to our shareholders, and I can't wait to share my thinking and vision with you at our investor update in October.  I would now like to turn the call back over to Dion and Steve to discuss the third quarter results. Dion Weisler : Thanks, Enrique. I'm truly proud of the work we've done to reinvent HP, and I have no doubt you'll be successful.  Now let me turn to the quarter. We have a solid operating and financial foundation in place, which was on display once again in quarter 3. We delivered revenue of $14.6 billion, up 2% in constant currency. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58, up 12%, and we generated free cash flow of $2.2 billion while returning almost $800 million to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends.  And we've also raised the midpoint of our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance. Our positive performance demonstrates HP's strong foundation and ability to compete successfully in the global marketplace that continues to be shaped by opportunities and challenges, including macro and geopolitical uncertainties. These results also reflect the consistent focus on executing our strategy and our leadership in key markets. We are still in the relatively early days of HP's reinvention, and you're going to see Enrique and the team taking actions to build on their progress. Now let me provide more detail on our business group performance in quarter 3. It was an exceptional quarter for Personal Systems with revenue up 6% in constant currency and operating profit increasing 51%. We are achieving these results with incredible innovation across the Personal Systems portfolio anchored in a relentless focus on customer insights. We launched more than 40 innovations in the quarter. We also continue to invest in key priorities including new products, services and solutions. In the Commercial business, we are meeting the needs of an increasingly mobile workforce. This quarter, we launched our latest EliteBook x360 lineup, which includes convertibles with up to 24 hours of battery life. More importantly, we continue to expand our security leadership position across our segments. This quarter, we rolled out HP Sure Sense across our latest EliteBooks and ZBooks, leveraging artificial intelligence to enable real-time malware protection. It's a similar innovation story in our Consumer business where we continue to set new benchmarks in design, performance and security. Our latest HP ENVY series features new stunning materials, our integrated privacy screen and the HP Webcam Kill Switch, which enables users to electrically turn off their webcams when not in use. No more Post-it Notes or stickers required. And in gaming, our OMEN ecosystem continues to thrive. At gamescom this week we announced a new lineup of cutting edge displays and accessories as well as the expansion of OMEN Command Center software and services to enable players at all levels to enhance their competitiveness. Across Personal Systems, we're driving an aggressive forward-looking agenda that's reinventing the way people work, live and play. And our products, supply chain and go-to-market are well positioned to capture ongoing demand and navigate industry dynamics.  Turning to Print. Revenue was down 5% driven by Supplies. We once again outperformed the market in an increasingly challenging environment. HP continues to lead the Print category with a sharp focus on innovative products and services. In the contractual market, which includes A3, we continue making progress in leveraging our differentiated technology and IP to capture opportunities in the market. We achieved 10% A3 market share in calendar quarter 2. From where we started, we have now reached critical mass in this important market segment. We continue to gain traction and scale, driven by the strategic decision we made to enter the A3 market and the smooth integration of Samsung Printing into our portfolio. More broadly, our contractual office business and consumer Instant Ink portfolio both again grew revenue double digits in the quarter. In Graphics, we continue to see adoption of our technology as customers increasingly go digital. Our new HP Stitch portfolio is being positively received by customers, and we have had several key wins with our HP Indigo packaging process. We are also launching new products to address customer needs and adapt to the realities of today's marketplace. In Q3, we introduced HP Neverstop Laser, the first of its kind in the industry. Designed for small business owners in emerging markets, it features toner that can be reloaded in 15 seconds with capacity of up to 5,000 pages with a very competitive cost per copy. We also unveiled HP Smart Tank for home printing, which delivers best-in-class print quality and ink tank experience allowing for up to 38% faster printing compared with previous generations.  Turning to Supplies. This category remains a work in progress particularly in EMEA. We have been aggressively addressing Supplies, and we are making progress relative to the strategic and operational initiatives we outlined on prior earnings calls. Strategically, we are growing our contractual businesses and adapting our business models. Operationally, among other actions, we have made and continue to make improvements in our business management systems, strengthen our pricing discipline, improve our channel partnerships and lower EMEA channel inventory levels in the Tier 1 and monitored Tier 2 ecosystem. We are also making senior leadership changes in EMEA. We believe these are all important steps in the right direction, and there is still more work to do. We acknowledge that these changes are having a short-term impact on EMEA's results, both in terms of the immediacy and the extent of the impact in the second half of fiscal '19. In addition, we are also seeing increasing macroeconomic softness, particularly in EMEA where we saw the most significant revenue declines and industry-wide signs of market softness. This contributed to Q3 Supplies revenue being below our prior expectations. We are focused on doing the right things structurally and operationally for the business. But we need to do more. We are making significant changes in our cost structure and demonstrating market leadership with the scale to navigate a dynamic environment.  Turning to our 3D Printing business. This quarter marked another set of important milestones. We opened the doors to 150,000-square-foot 3D Printing Center of Excellence in Barcelona. This is HP innovation at its best, bringing together the strength of HP's resources along with our partners and customers in what we believe is the largest and most advanced 3D printing and digital manufacturing R&D center in the world. We also continue to drive installations with industrial grade customers and are seeing early traction for our Multi Jet Fusion 5200 solution. We are especially pleased to see customers embracing new data and software capabilities to achieve new levels of industrial manufacturing predictability, reliability, efficiency and quality. Lastly, as we grow our business, we continue to do so in ways that serve the needs of our people, planet and communities. In Q3 we published our annual Sustainable Impact Report, documenting the progress we are making. These are not just the right things to do, they are the right things to do for our business. For example, our sustainable impact programs contributed to more than $900 million of new revenue in 2018, and that's a 35% increase versus the prior year. And we believe this will be a growing source of competitive advantage for HP in the years ahead. To sum up, we continue to deliver strong earnings and free cash flow, reflecting the power of the broad portfolio we built and the ability of our teams to navigate market opportunities and challenges. We still have a lot of work ahead. We always will. I have enormous confidence in our business, our strategy and our team, including Enrique as our next CEO. You will see Enrique and the leadership team take actions to make significant changes in our cost structure, advance key strategic priorities and position HP for the future. Let me now pass the call over to Steve for more insight into this quarter's financial results. Steven Fieler : Thanks, Dion. Before I go through the results, I just want to thank you for your leadership of HP. I appreciate your partnership and you know that I won't be removing you from my speed dial just yet. And Enrique has already been on my speed dial for a long time, so that won't change. I look forward to a seamless transition in our partnership going forward. Our third quarter performance reinforces HP's ability to deliver consistent company results, profitably grow and effectively manage our broad-based portfolio. In Q3, we grew operating profit dollars, generated strong cash flow and delivered double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. Our financial performance this quarter demonstrates our ability to successfully invest in our business while delivering strong financial results. We remain focused on pursuing returns-based opportunities ahead of us while also addressing challenges when we have them. This helps set up the company to deliver in the short term and generate long-term value creation. Let's look at the details of the third quarter. Net revenue was $14.6 billion, flat year-on-year or up 2% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas and EMEA were flat, and APJ grew 11%. Gross margin was 19.9%, up 1.5 percentage points year-on-year, driven by disciplined execution and improved rate in Personal Systems. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.8 billion, up 9%, driven by increased investments for both growth and efficiency including investments in innovation, targeted marketing spend as well as investments in HP's digital infrastructure. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $68 million for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.58, up $0.06 or 12% with a diluted share count of approximately 1.5 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes amortization of intangible assets of $23 million, acquisition-related credits of $12 million, restructuring and other charges of $14 million as well as nonoperating retirement-related credits of $19 million. It also excludes a net gain of $305 million for tax adjustments. This net gain is primarily driven by the net income tax gains resulting from several tax settlements across various jurisdictions, partially offset by the tax indemnification associated with these gains recorded in OI&E, which is part of the Hewlett-Packard Enterprise tax matters agreement. As a result, Q3 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.78. At the segment level, in Personal Systems, we are very pleased with our results. Revenue in the third quarter was $9.7 billion, up 3% or 6% in constant currency. By customer segment, we once again saw a divergence in performance, with Commercial revenue up 10% and Consumer revenue down 11%. By product category, revenue was up 8% for Desktop, up 4% for Workstations and flat for Notebooks. The team continued to successfully manage our overall product mix as Commercial demand remained strong while navigating some of the softer consumer markets. Q3 operating margins grew very strong at 5.6%, up 1.7 points year-on-year. The exceptionally large increase was driven mainly by the team's continued focus on our strategy and disciplined execution in a favorable commodity cost environment. Operating profit was $547 million, up $185 million from the prior year. In Print, the business outperformed a more difficult market. That being said, the results were mixed. We grew Commercial hardware revenue, increased our market share and continue to make progress in our contractual offerings. However, operating margins were down 0.4 points to 15.6% due to lower Supplies revenue. Looking at the details. Q3 total Print revenue was $4.9 billion, down 5% nominally and in constant currency. Commercial hardware revenue was up 3%, and Consumer hardware revenue was down 10%. Total Hardware units were down 9% with Commercial units down 4% and Consumer units down 10%. In calendar quarter 2, HP gained market share to 44% as the overall market declined. Third quarter Supplies revenue was $3.2 billion, down 7% in constant currency with EMEA down in the mid-teens. Tier 1 channel inventory levels remained below the reduced ceilings. We are making progress on the operational and strategic plans described in prior quarters and remain confident we are taking the right action. However, with the increasing softness in the EMEA market, we expect Supplies revenue to remain weak in Q4 as we continue to make progress on our plan and thus, we expect Supplies revenue to decline approximately 4% to 5% for the full fiscal year. Looking forward, we expect to take significantly more cost out of the business while also making more financial shifts in our business model across our combined hardware, services and Supplies profit pools. The combination of these operational, market and strategic factors means that we are not planning for Supplies revenue to grow in FY '20. Importantly, having said that, at our next investor update, we will share the multiple levers we have that give us confidence in growing non-GAAP EPS in FY '20.  Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Q3 cash flow from operations and free cash flow were very strong at $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. In Q3, the cash conversion cycle was minus 36 days. Sequentially, cash conversion cycle improved 4 days, in line with normal seasonality with a 3-day increase in days payable outstanding, a 2-day decrease in days sales outstanding and a 1 day increase in days of inventory. We returned $533 million to shareholders through share repurchases and $240 million via cash dividends in Q3. Year-to-date, we have returned 75% of free cash flow to shareholders. Looking forward to Q4, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook : We continue to expect a headwind from currency. In Personal Systems, we expect the pricing environment to be competitive; and in Print, we expect the market to remain soft in the fourth quarter; in addition, for the full, year we continue to expect our non-GAAP tax rate, which is based on our long-term non-GAAP financial projection to be 16% in FY '19. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook : Q4 '19 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.59; Q4 '19 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.55. We are raising our full year fiscal 2019 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.18 to $2.22. And full year fiscal '19 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.31 to $2.35.  And we continue to expect to return approximately 75% of free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases over the course of the full fiscal year.  Operator, let's open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Huberty : Dion, I've really enjoyed watching you succeed as CEO. Sorry to see you go, but best wishes for both of you and your family. In terms of questions, the midpoint of fiscal fourth quarter EPS guidance is down a $0.01 versus the fiscal third quarter. If you look at the past 2 years, EPS expanded in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about some of the incremental headwinds that are driving the worst seasonality this year? And then I have a follow-up. Steven Fieler : Sure. I'll take that one, Katy. We've been steadily delivering all year on our EPS. And as you know, we did increase the full year outlook on the strength of Q3. I would describe Q4, we will remain prudent in balancing our current view of the risks and opportunities. Maybe I'll just touch a little bit on what we're thinking and our outlook for Personal Systems and Print. So for Personal Systems, we'll still have a CPU-constrained environment across certain products. We're assuming that the incremental China tariffs on notebooks do not happen in Q4 according to the existing plan of record. But importantly for the guidance, we're expecting a dynamic and competitive pricing environment with some of the supply chain costs and benefits we had, had in Q3 softening as we enter into Q4. So in essence, the headwind we are seeing in FX offset by some of the supply chain tailwind that we've had from a cost perspective will steady out in Q4. In Print, expect the overall print market to be soft. We'll continue to look for opportunities to place units. That being said, we do expect that the units could be impacted assuming the tariffs are impacted, which could mean we raised prices and could impact units, but less of an issue on operating profit dollars. We are expecting Supplies declines closer to our Q3 results in Q4, but we do expect to drive overall expense management. So when I take that all into account, it's sort of a prudent guide. With confidence, we can deliver within the range of $0.55 to $0.59. Kathryn Huberty : Printer Supplies as you've mentioned, down 7% was worse than you expected. You talked about some of the macro headwinds. But how did you perform in the inventory drawdown in EMEA? Your partner Canon suggested that the drawdown is now over and growth can improve in the back half of the year. Do you share that view? Or how much inventory depletion and investment to drive branded Supplies market share is still left to come into the model in the fourth quarter? Steven Fieler : So I said previously, the sizing of the overall inventory is a triangulation, given our lack of visibility into the entire channel ecosystem. But I'll start with some of the data to address your point, Katy, and then I'll provide some additional color. So in EMEA, since Q1, we brought down our channel inventory dollars that we monitor, so this is both the Tier 1 and parts of the Tier 2 where we have visibility. The total channel inventory dollar reduction is nearly the $100 million that we initially estimated. So we have made good progress. However, it's not possible to specifically quantify what impact we've made in the rest of the unmonitored downstream ecosystem. In addition, we do know that we've been reducing channel inventory dollars at the same time the EMEA market is softening, which is the right thing to do and important business discipline. It does make it more difficult to distinguish the market factors versus operational factors. It's important that we continue to maintain our Tier 1 channel inventory under the reduced ceilings globally, which we are, and we're also improving the monitoring of our Tier 2. Operator : Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Dion, I want to echo Katy comments. We've enjoyed working with you and we want -- hope for the best for your family. My first question, it's just -- if we can understand a bit more about what's going on in Printing, and I don't know if Enrique is still around, but I'd be curious as to how much of this seems to be a secular shift, and then we started to hear a lot more concern out of the Japanese in the most recent quarter, that they reported relative to some of their prior commentary, not just Canon but others. So I'm curious if there's something really changing here or if you think it's more again the macro pressures. And then I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : So Shannon, thank you for the question. Let me talk first about Supplies and then I will give you an overall view of the print market. On the Supplies space as we discussed in Q1, we see 2 different type of issues, some more operational, some more strategic. The strategic issues presumably will have a longer term impact, and we see will be impacting us not only this year but also the years to come. And this has, though that some of our competitors have also been highlighting. During the last year, we have created a very attractive profit pool of supply but now has attracted many other companies to try to attack it, and capture a portion of it without having to have a significant investment that are necessary to create the hardware installed base. And because of that, we see an erosion of the overall profit pool that, according to our model, means a reduction in share and a reduction in price. We are experiencing that, and many of our own competitors have experience in similar dynamics. On top of that, during the last quarter we have seen a slowdown in -- we have seen an economic slowdown, and this is also having an impact, especially in the Consumer side. When -- so when we look at the combination of all the factors I described, you can understand many of the comments that many of the other companies in the industry have been making during the last quarter. Shannon Cross : And maybe I don't know if you want to take my follow-up question, but I'm curious as -- and I know, I'm not trying to front run what you're going to say at the Analyst Day, but as you look at some of the top line pressures that you're facing and the fact that PCs are going to go, probably will be under pressure next year or following the end of life for 1 7, and the 1 10 refresh, how does that impact your thoughts on investment in some of the other areas that the company is looking at, like 3D Printing and the A3 market? Will that shift any of, of where the spend is going? Steven Fieler : I'll maybe address that first, and then Enrique, if you want to chime in, Shannon. So I think the reality is, that we expect to continue to do both. It's about investments in innovation and also productivity and efficiency. And as you heard in our prepared remarks from both Dion, Enrique and myself, we do think that there's an opportunity to take significant cost out of the business while maintaining our investments for growth. I mean just to give you a little bit of context, as you all see in our P&L, but we've got over $50 billion of annual spend. So we've got a rather large addressable spend opportunity to go after across cost of goods in OpEx, so really every percentage point here really matters. And so you'll be hearing more about the opportunities we see in the month ahead at the Investor Day, but overall, we can sort of align our cost activities with our growth and investing activities. Enrique Lores : I think Shannon, you will see that our line going forward is going to be aligned around 3 different complementary directions : First, we need to continue to expand into some of the growth opportunities that we had identified in the past, 3D Printing, contractual businesses are all opportunities for us to grow; at the same time, we need to continue evolving our business model. I highlighted that already last year during the Investor Day, and we will share some of the progress and the plans that we've had to double down in this space; and third, we have a great opportunity to create value by continuing to simplify our company, get close to customers -- getting closer to customers and also reduce our cost structure. Because this reduction in cost structure will give us also the opportunity and the capacity to continue to invest in the growth area. Dion Weisler : Just to round that out, I'd just finally say that, that's what gives all of us, myself, Steve and Enrique, the confidence of these multiple levers that we see and gives us that confidence in our ability to grow EPS again next year. Operator : Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : And let me reiterate previous comments. Dion, I wish you all the best and for your family going forward. And Enrique, look forward to working with you more closely. I just wanted to follow up on the Printing. So it sounds like things have gotten notably worse in the last couple of months because, as you noted, your guidance originally was Supplies to be down 3%, and you were tracking to that through the first half of the year, and now you're suggesting it's going to be down 4% or 5%, which would suggest that the second half is going to be down 6% or 7%, which is dramatically worse than you had thought. And I think initially your thought, through tactical improvement, things might actually get a little progressively better over the course of the year. And so if I just reflect on the magnitude of that change in outlook, are you really suggesting that most of this is a bigger strategic headwind from cloning and alternatives than you had originally thought? Or are you suggesting that the economic weakness in Europe is the principal driver? Because I guess my observation would be, globally, the economy is still pretty healthy. And so if we're seeing with relatively healthy global economy, normalized Supplies growth is minus 6% or minus 7%, that's pretty rough to me. So perhaps you could clarify that, and I have a follow-up, please. Steven Fieler : Let me provide some financial context and hand over to Dion for additional color. So in the first half, our total Supplies revenue was down 3%. EMEA was down roughly 9% in the same period. And in Q3, total Supplies was down 7% with EMEA down mid-teens. I say that because I want to be very clear that our Supplies performance continues to be driven by EMEA. Dion Weisler : Yes, and let me try to add a little bit of context here. There's 2 primary factors here that are occurring simultaneously. The first one is as we look across the macroeconomic environment, particularly in EMEA, we are seeing even more uncertainty in industry-wide market softness. And secondly, as I described in my prepared remarks, we're making progress in the plans we outlined on the prior earnings calls, and taking the appropriate structural and operational actions including marketing and our brand protection, business management systems as well as our deal pricing discipline that we talked about in the past, just to name a few. In addition, we're making senior management changes in EMEA, and all of these are designed to put our EMEA Print business on a stronger footing. And while we had expected that these changes would create a short-term impact in the channel, we underestimated the immediacy, the reaction and the size of the impact on the back half of the year. And it's the combination of these 2 factors that have the larger-than-anticipated decline in EMEA. But as Steve mentioned in these prepared remarks, we are confident that in spite of all of this, we can navigate through these challenges and hit our senior metrics of EPS and free cash flow. And finally, we're confident in the multiple levers that we see and that again gives us confidence in our ability to grow EPS again next year. Toni Sacconaghi : Just to change topics. As you noted, the PC margins were exceptionally strong this quarter. And Steve, it sounded like your guidance for Q4 and your description of a more competitive PC environment was suggesting that margins may not be as strong. But how do we think about normalized PC margins? I think you had at one point said 3% to 5%, and then sort of lowered that to 3% to 4%. What do you think is normalized? And how quickly do you feel that the following component prices will ultimately be passed along to end customers? Steven Fieler : So we do view Q3 as an exceptional quarter for us, growing operating profit dollars $185 million in Personal Systems alone. And I do want to give kudos to the team, they stuck with the strategy. They've remained disciplined all year with the year-to-date performance of 4.7% up margins and over $300 million profit drop in that segment alone. But to directly address your question : We do expect margins to normalize back, I would say into the 3% to 5% range, Toni. Our goal of approaching the higher end of that over time. There will always be more shorter-term headwinds and tailwinds, whether it be commodity cost, FX, other pricing dynamics that tend to move pretty rapidly. What we're focused on is the longer term shift of our mix and improvement of our portfolio across our products and services, and this is a stickier, more structural margin improvement that we expect to get over time, again with the goal of getting to the higher end of that 3% to 5% over the years ahead. Dion Weisler : And I think, Toni, you've seen the team very consistently over multiple years deliver against that strategy and that's what you can expect from us in the future. Operator : Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Dion, best wishes to you and your family in the future. I guess 2 questions for me as well. Given the Supplies discussion we've had so far, versus what you guys thought 90 days ago, how much of the shortfall is the macro getting worse versus execution issues? Is there a way to split those 2 buckets up? And then Dion or Enrique, I'd love to hear your conviction and confidence on why you think this issue's not spread beyond EMEA to North America or APJ as well? Steven Fieler : So on the first part of it, it's really hard to bifurcate the data between what the 2 actions -- the 2 items that Dion described, sort of the actions we're taking in the market and how that's changed. What I will highlight, I think it's important to highlight is, if you just reflect on the first half of the year in Print, our Supplies were down 3%, and we grew operating profit dollars in that period. And I do want to acknowledge we do not grow OP dollars in Print in Q3, given the larger Supplies decline, but we do have multiple levers across our Print business from more profitability on our hardware services, more growth in our growth initiatives as well as cost structure items to address in Print. So there are other levers beyond Supplies. Dion Weisler : Yes, I'll also chime in here and I'll ask Enrique to give us his thoughts, but as I discussed in quarter 2, we continue to make progress on the action plans that I laid out in February, our Supplies task force is really taking the appropriate and very decisive steps in EMEA to put our Supplies business in better fighting shape in light of the industry-wide and macro headwinds that we're seeing. We expected an impact from these actions that the size and the timing of the ripples caused in the back half of this year is something that we underestimate. And I'm sure Enrique can give you sort of a little more color on our progress there as well. Enrique Lores : Okay. So let me cover some of the operational improvements that we have made. As I've had, had -- as we have learned in Q1, the nature of the [indiscernible] operating side growth on operational and a strategic side. On the operational side, we aligned 4 areas of progress, so let me share some of them. We say that we needed to increase our investment in demand generation in the online side. We have done that and we have seen the progress. For example, in most of the key European markets, we have seen a 10-point improvement in coverage when customers look for us, for Supplies in Google. We have also doubled down in our brand protection activity, both increasing our efforts to fight counterfeit, but also in protecting our IP. And protecting our IP is something we have done by ourselves, but also you have seen Canon taking very decisive actions in their side of the portfolio, where they own the IP. We have also continued to improve the visibility that we've had in the Tier 2 space. And just in Europe, we have increased the number of reporting partners by 50%. And as Dion said, in Q1, we have also improved our business management system. We have centralized pricing decisions, and we have changed and improved the controls around our discount policy, again to make sure that we manage the business more effectively. As you can see, these has all grown very broad on these actions, but it will take some time until we see the full effect of all of those. Operator : Our next question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : And again, Dion, I'll echo the sentiments of everybody on the call. It's been great working with you, thought you did just a really fantastic job with the company and wish you and your family all the best in the future. So yes, good luck. Two if I could. I guess just sticking with Supplies and one on PCs. Any sense of how long you think, I guess, getting sort of call it critical mass with some of the structural channel dynamics in Europe, I would say. Because it sounds like you have some sense of what's going on since you've adjusted the guidance here. And I know you're going to give updated guidance at the Analyst Day, but it would be helpful if you could get some sense of how many quarters we are, how many months we are, when you guys kind of get into structural, critical mass. And then I have a follow-up. Steven Fieler : So maybe I'll take that one first. And as I said in my prepared remarks, and I think Enrique went into long detail about FY '20 and the strategic and operational things, so I would bifurcate the 2. So in the operational side, where we're driving in EMEA, we are making good progress. And yes, the timing extent and sort of the immediacy of the impact was harder than we anticipated, but we are making good progress and would expect to work through these operational changes in relatively short order in the quarters to come. As it relates to the more strategic impact, that's the more sustainable impact for us, and it's really the primary driver of why we don't expect Supplies to grow in FY '20. That being said, as I commented previously, we have multiple levers. We've demonstrated this with the first half of the year, growing operating profit dollars even with our Supplies business declining. We've got levers around the growth initiatives that we're driving, we got levers around the business model itself, the shift to contractual, the shift to more profit in hardware and services itself. And we've got levers around our cost structure and significant cost saving opportunities. And these things holistically is why we have confidence in our EPS plans for next year to grow. We've been working on this plan as a team. Enrique, Dion, myself and the leadership team, and we're all confident in our ability to grow EPS next year. Enrique Lores : Actually, it is easier to answer. The strategic problem on the supply side would be, we are addressing by business model changes. The acceleration of our Printing as a service business is critical there. You have seen us introducing printers with a different business model, both on the ink side and in the laser side. And actually, we are leading now many of these markets. And also, we will be looking at our cost structure, we will continue to reduce our cost structure to make sure that we deliver on the EPS goals that Steve was mentioning before. Steven Fieler : We look forward to laying all these plans out with you at the investor meeting. Ananda Baruah : And guys, is it possible to return to growth at any quarter in fiscal year '20? Steven Fieler : I'm assuming that question was in relation to Supplies. And I don't think we want to give any comment specifically on any particular quarter. Again, I think we're looking at our portfolio holistically, about the ability to drive the company results, both earnings per share and cash flow. I do want to also highlight, we have a strong Personal Systems business that represented 42% of our operating profit in Q3, so we have multiple levers at our company to grow our earnings per share. Operator : Our next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Timothy Long : Just 2 if I could. First, can you just give us a little color on the Personal Systems side? Consumers' been tough the last few quarters. Could you just give us a little insight into what it's going to take to get that segment going again? And then second, on that A3 side, you mentioned getting a 10%, getting some scale there. What does that scale mean? When do -- when will we start seeing some more Supplies pull through? What does that scale gain you when it comes to the financial model? Steven Fieler : Yes. So we look at our Personal Systems results, and actually, our company results, we did see a softer Consumer similar to what we saw last quarter and a stronger Commercial. I think when we look at the results, we are seeing softer Consumer across the board with a stronger Commercial. Some of that is driven on the Personal Systems side by the supply and availability of supply we're getting and demand shaping as appropriate. It's important that you all understand we've got a very diversified portfolio across Consumer and Commercial. Even Commercial is SMB enterprise, and we're selling to the industrial space. So given the diversity of the geographies we play in and the product portfolio that we have, the customer segments that we play in, we feel like we can manage through up and down environments. Dion Weisler : Yes. As it relates to the second question, we've said all along it will be very strategic and systematic in how we go after this $50 billion-plus A3 market. I've also said on many occasions that customers don't think about their printing in the context of A3 or A4. In fact, many don't even know the difference. They think about their overall Printing solutions. And I realize that we set a 12% share target by the end of 2020, but our overall focus has always been on building a contractual business, and A3 is a key element of that strategy. It's also been important that we validate our technology and achieve critical mass in a competitive field, and we're doing just that. We achieved double-digit market share at 10%, and we expanded our OEM partnership that we announced earlier in Q3 with Xerox, which further validates the strength of our strategy and the product portfolio. So I'm really not fixated on getting to 12% share by any particular period. And I'm not saying that we will or we won't, but what is important is we build the right distribution and partners to penetrate the contractual office. So from a customer's perspective, which is what guides us, what I can say is in the overall Printing solution is what matters most and when you combine our A3 products, our technology, our channel and our overall capabilities, and we couple that with our market-leading A4 presence, we really have a very compelling and formidable portfolio. So remember our larger strategy is to grow in contractual and to evolve our business model into more services and solutions. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank. Kanghui Ong : So Print margins have degraded to kind of the lowest point in at least a couple of years. I think asking -- focusing on Printing a different way, is there a scenario where Print margins maintain even if Supplies revenues decline? And what would be the growth drivers in other businesses perhaps, to get the margins to stabilize? Steven Fieler : I think it's important that, to communicate our focus is on operating profit dollars. It always has been, it's OP dollars and not related to any particular quarter. As I alluded to earlier, we have different levers, not just applied, to drive our profit dollars. As it relates to the rate specifically, we did deliver a 15.6% op margin in Q3. It is below our target, at least 16%. I would expect Q4 margins to remain weaker, given my Supplies commentary. I'm -- probably more in the range of our Q3 margins as we work through the EMEA Supplies challenges and overall Print market weakness. That being said, in the near term, our annual op margin target remains at, at least 16%. But to reiterate, our focus is on OP dollars, and opportunities to drive even more operating profit dollars outside of Supplies with the items I talked about earlier today. Dion Weisler : Yes. Look, additionally I'll add that at the company level, we're really proud of how we manage our total portfolio and we continue to deliver consistently against our senior metrics of earnings per share and free cash flow, the commitments that we make. I think you should draw great comfort from this and that this highly experienced team knows how to operate in both up and down markets and how to respond positively to the inevitable business challenges that are just part of business. Kanghui Ong : Got it, appreciate that. I've got another one but I'll flip over to the PC side. There's about 130 basis point improvement quarter-on-quarter in margins. So it seems like while some of your peers might have seen better margins in their PC businesses a quarter earlier probably due to memory components, it seems you're predominantly seeing the memory prices better in the latest quarter. I guess is there any way that you guys have thought about breaking down how much of this quarter-on-quarter increase in margins was due to components versus perhaps better mix or more Consumer versus -- or better mix or more Commercial versus Consumer, I'm sorry. And any way you can break that down for us? Steven Fieler : Well, what I'd say it's all of the above. I mean we continue to make progress. The team has been very disciplined with their pricing strategy. But our also -- our overall Personal Systems mix on a year-over-year basis continues to improve. I don't think -- if I'm going to break it down specifically, but is, to the earlier question, was from Toni, our operating margin rate target is between 3% to 5%. And over time, our plans are to drive to the upper end of that rate. Dion Weisler : So unfortunately we're out of time, and I want to thank everyone for joining us today. I also want to extend a personal thank you to all of you for your warm wishes and for your personal support over the years. It's been an honor working with you. We obviously had a lot to talk about today. 4 years ago, many people doubted this business. We didn't. We reinvigorated this business and reinvented HP. The team's executing against our strategy and investing in innovation while simultaneously taking cost out of the business, and we always have to do both. As a result, we've delivered consistent free cash flow and met or exceeded our non-GAAP EPS outlook for the last 15 out of 15 quarters. I like that batting average. Enrique, you need to continue that. We have a strong foundation, a really strong foundation, a powerful portfolio. We have world-class talent. We have a culture of performance. It's been an honor to serve as CEO of this iconic company. Enrique's been a tremendous partner to me as we reinvented HP, and I couldn't be more excited and optimistic for him and for the future of HP under his leadership. I'm 100% focused on finishing our Q4 and the fiscal year and to ensuring a smooth transition at the company that I love and then to look forward to continue to guide the company as a director moving forward. Thank you very much. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. And you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Beth Howe : Good afternoon. I'm Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations for HP Inc., and I'd like to welcome you to the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter earnings conference call with Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Fieler, HP's Chief Financial Officer.

Enrique Lores : Thank you, Beth, and thank you for joining us today. HP delivered another strong earnings quarter, reflecting the strength of our innovation and execution, the progress we are making against our strategic priorities and the multiple value-creation engines across our company. In Q4, we grew revenue 2% in constant currency. We grew non-GAAP operating profit dollars 5%, and we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.60, an increase of 11% and above our guided range. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter where we have grown revenue, non-GAAP OP dollars and non-GAAP EPS. The fourth quarter capped off a very solid year in which we exceeded our targets for non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow. Our strategy is working, and we are confident about our business outlook heading into fiscal year '20. For the full FY '19, we grew revenue 2% in constant currency, our third consecutive year of growth. We grew non-GAAP EPS 11% with double-digit increases for the last 2 years. We generated $4 billion in free cash flow, above our full year outlook, and we returned 85% of that to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We continue to lead in our core market with strong, disciplined execution, finishing the year shipping roughly 1 in every 4 PC units and 2 out of every 5 printers. These results demonstrate that we have multiple levers to drive operating profit dollars and create shareholder value. And I want to be very clear, our focus remains on creating value for all of our shareholders and delivering for our customers, partners and employees. I have great confidence in the strategy that we shared at our Securities Analyst Meeting. It is confirmed by the progress we have already started to make in the 5 key strategic moves I laid out. Let me recap each of them and share initial examples of the progress we are making. The first move is implementing a new operating model and driving digital transformation. On November 1, we went live with our new operating model and the creation of a single commercial organization to simplify our go-to-market structure. We have taken out the regional layer of the organization. This helped us to reduce costs, accelerate decision-making and be closer to customers. We have also introduced a new business management system to streamline accountability. Second, we are delivering new compute experiences. HP is delivering the best innovation in the market. Recently, we launched our lightest commercial notebook, the Elite Dragonfly. With an ultra-bright screen and HP Sure View privacy, this device is purpose-built for the modern workforce, which demands flexibility to work anywhere. It is also the world's first laptop made using ocean-bound plastic, reflecting our continued commitment to environmental sustainability. It's another example of how we continue to set new standards in the PC category. In addition, we continue to strengthen our commitment to security with the acquisition of Bromium, an innovator in endpoint security. Our belief is that every device decision is a security decision. With Bromium, we will be able to provide comprehensive protection against the most sophisticated malware and enhance our firmware and BIOS security layers. Third, we are evolving print business models. Our contractual business continued to grow, with MPS and Instant Ink up double digits. And with over [ 5 million ] subscribers, the momentum in Instant Ink continues to build. At the same time, our big ink and big toner products extended their rollout, launching in Latin America and Central Europe. Importantly, the new transactional business model we introduced at SAM, which offers customers either a flexible or a full end-to-end HP system, is on track to launch new products by the end of fiscal year '20. And remember, this model will evolve over time. Fourth, we are expanding our industrial businesses. In graphics, we see steady growth in pages printed. In fiscal year '19, in 3D and digital manufacturing, we more than doubled the number of parts produced with over [ 18 million ] final production parts across a widening range of applications. We remain on track to double the number of parts by the end of fiscal year '20. And we just helped Volkswagen produce 10,000 precision metal parts in just a few weeks to support the launch of their ID.3 electric vehicle. And finally, we are executing on our restructuring. We have initiated a voluntary early retirement program in the United States, and the take rate increases my confidence in our ability to deliver on our savings goal. Let me now make a few comments on our business segment performance. In Q4, Personal Systems delivered another strong performance of revenue, operating profit and share growth. Revenue grew 5% in constant currency and operating profit increased 48%. These results reinforce the strength of our innovation and disciplined execution against our strategy. We continued to outperform the PC market with broad-based growth across all regions and product categories. In calendar Q3, we grew faster than our competitors, gaining 1.2 points of share. While we are proud of these results, share gain continues to be an outcome, not an objective. We are delivering these results despite the ongoing industry constraints on CPU capacity, which are now expected to continue into the first half of 2020 and to be more impactful in Q1. Turning to Print, we continue to execute our strategy. In Q4, total revenue declined 5% in constant currency. As we had anticipated, Supplies revenue remained soft. We're executing against both the operational and strategic plans we laid out in prior quarters. And as we said, into fiscal year '20, we expect our new commercial organization will drive better global best practices and consistency in Supplies execution. In fact, elements of the design and implementation of the new commercial organization are expressly focused on addressing some of the operational issues and leadership changes in EMEA. As always, maximizing the value of our installed base is a core objective. We are driving preference for HP original supplies with targeted marketing campaigns that ensures that customers understand the quality, sustainability and security benefits of HP original supplies compared to the alternative. We expect the combination of these actions to show improvement as we get further into fiscal year '20, and we remain focused on maximizing the value of our installed base. In graphics, we recently closed another key win with ePac Flexible Packaging for an additional 24 HP Indigo digital presses as they continue the disruption of the global flexible packaging market. Looking at 3D and digital manufacturing, we finished the year strong. Our business continues to grow, and the market acceptance of our new industrial 5200 solution has been positive. We are expanding our alliance ecosystem and building in production applications across key verticals, including automotive, industrial, consumer and health care. I am pleased with our progress and look forward to delivering even more disruptive solutions in fiscal year '20. In closing, we delivered another good quarter, demonstrating our track record of execution. These results and the progress we are making gives me confidence in our strategy and the upside opportunities HP has for even greater value creation. Our plans to advance, disrupt and transform provide us with 3 powerful engines of value creation and supports a clear and compelling investment thesis. We believe that the powerful combination of our scale, channel reach and incredible brand, combined with our track record of execution and innovation, will create significant value for our customers and our shareholders. Now before I turn the call over to Steve, let me note that we will not be expanding on our previous public comments with regards to Xerox's proposal. Accordingly, we ask that you please keep your questions focused on the business and our results during the Q&A portion of this call as we will not be commenting on Xerox or its proposal. Now I will turn it over to Steve to go through more detail and provide our financial outlook. Steven Fieler : Thanks, Enrique. Q4 was a solid finish to FY '19, where we once again demonstrated our ability to consistently deliver company results, posting growth in revenue, non-GAAP operating profit and EPS. Before diving further into Q4, let me quickly recap FY '19 for the full year. We grew revenue, we grew non-GAAP operating profit dollars faster than revenue and we grew non-GAAP EPS even faster. These results show the strength of our financial model. For the full year, constant currency revenue was up 2%, non-GAAP operating profit dollars grew 3%, with operating margin rate expansion in both Print and Personal Systems. Print grew margins by 10 basis points to 16%, while PS grew 120 basis points to 4.9%, and both within our guided ranges. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $2.24, an increase of 11% and above our guided range. We generated $4 billion of free cash flow, ahead of our full year outlook of at least $3.7 billion, and we returned $3.4 billion or 85% of free cash flow to shareholders. Importantly, we delivered these results while investing in our business for future growth and efficiency opportunities. Our foundation is strong, including our balance sheet, and we have multiple levers to create value for our shareholders. This is what we said at our Securities Analyst Meeting, and this is what we intend to do. Overall, we are pleased with our full year results despite more challenging industry, macroeconomic and geopolitical dynamics. Now let's look at the details of the fourth quarter. Net revenue was $15.4 billion, flat year-on-year or up 2% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, APJ grew 7%, Americas grew 1% and EMEA was flat. Gross margin was 19%, up 1.4 percentage points year-on-year, driven primarily by disciplined execution and improved rate in Personal Systems as well as improved rate in Print supported by higher hardware gross margins. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.8 billion, up 11%, driven by increased investments for both growth and efficiency, including investments to drive future revenue and innovation as well as investments in HP's digital transformation. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $60 million for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.60, up $0.06 or 11%, with a diluted share count of approximately 1.5 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes amortization of intangible assets of $21 million, acquisition-related charges of $21 million, restructuring and other charges of $105 million as well as nonoperating retirement-related credits of $14 million. It also excludes a net expense of $378 million for tax adjustments. This net expense is primarily driven by the termination of our Tax Matters Agreement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, partially offset by other tax adjustments. As a result, Q4 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.26. At the segment level, in Personal Systems, we are again very pleased with our results. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $10.4 billion, up 4% or 5% in constant currency. By customer segment, commercial revenue was up 8%, and consumer revenue was down 4%. By product category, revenue was up 12% for workstations, up 5% for desktops and up 2% for notebooks. The team continued to successfully manage our overall product mix as commercial demand remains strong, while navigating a softer consumer market. Personal Systems has been consistently delivering profitable growth and share gains over time. HP outgrew the market in calendar quarter 3 with strong execution, HP-specific innovation and a focus on exceptional partner and end customer experiences. In addition, we see opportunities to improve our portfolio mix over time in areas of premium, displays and accessories and services. For example, this quarter, our revenue in retail solutions business and gaming, along with our services orders, all grew double digits. Q4 operating margins remained exceptionally strong at 5.3%, up 1.6 points year-on-year. The large increase was driven mainly by the team's continued execution of our strategy, balancing the industry's various puts and takes and remaining disciplined in a favorable commodity cost environment. Operating profit was $556 million, up 48% from the prior year. In Print, the business performed generally in line with our expectations for the quarter. We continue to deliver leading customer experiences, big progress in our contractual offerings, incrementally shift more profit to hardware and address our near-term operational challenges in EMEA. Looking at the details. Q4 total Print revenue was $5 billion, down 6% nominally and 5% in constant currency. Our operating margins were down 0.4 points to 15.6% due to lower Supplies revenue. Commercial hardware revenue was down 2%, and consumer hardware revenue was down 10%. Total hardware units were down 9% driven by declines in consumer units, which were down 10%, with commercial units down 1%. Fourth quarter Supplies revenue was $3.2 billion, down 7% in constant currency, again, driven by declines in EMEA. We are making progress on our operational improvement plans, and we've seen a significant reduction in Tier 1 and monitored Tier 2 channel inventory dollars in EMEA throughout the year. Overall, Tier 1 channel inventory levels remained below the reduced ceilings. We continue to make progress on our strategic plans to evolve our business models. We're seeing success in contractual as we grew both management service and Instant Ink this quarter. Importantly, we remain under-indexed in contractual and are pleased that we continue to outgrow the market. Let me now turn to our transformation efforts, and specifically our cost savings opportunities. At SAM, we described our plans to generate approximately $1 billion of gross run rate savings by the end of FY '22, and that we continue looking for more opportunities. In Q4, we announced a voluntary early retirement program in the United States. More than 1,000 participants have opted into the plan, which will be effective through the course of the year. This take rate adds to our confidence in delivering both the FY '20 and overall planned savings targets. Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Q4 cash flow from operations and free cash flow were $588 million and $392 million, respectively. We generated $4 billion in free cash flow for the full year. In Q4, the cash conversion cycle was minus 31 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle declined 5 days, in line with normal seasonality, with a 6-day decrease in days payable outstanding, a 2-day increase in days sales outstanding and a 3-day decrease in days of inventory. We've returned $461 million to shareholders through share repurchases and $236 million via cash dividends in Q4. For the full year, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and $1 billion via cash dividends. Looking forward to Q1 and FY '20, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. We expect that the macroeconomic conditions will remain dynamic, as they are today, and we expect our end markets to remain competitive. We're expecting currency to have about a 1% year-over-year negative impact. Specific to Personal Systems, we expect commodities to be significantly less of a tailwind in FY '20 than in FY '19, especially in the second half. We now expect industry-wide CPU supply constraints to persist through the first half of 2020. In Q1, specifically, we're anticipating a larger revenue impact than in Q4. However, we expect our mix to shift to more profitable units, which should largely mitigate the profit impact. In Printing, we're assuming a year-over-year unit market decline driven by the home market. As a reminder, we are deliberately not chasing share, especially as we raise hardware pricing and focus on profitable growth. As described at SAM, as we progress through the year, we expect the net benefits of our transformation cost savings and other operational changes to begin to materialize. In addition, for the full year, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate, which is based on our long-term non-GAAP financial projection, to be 16% in FY '20. Consistent to what we communicated in October, we expect to return at least 75% of free cash flow to shareholders in FY '20 as we view our shares as significantly undervalued. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook : Q1 '20 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.56; Q1 '20 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.39 to $0.42. We are raising our full year fiscal 2020 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.24 to $2.32, and full year fiscal '20 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2 to $2.10. Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today will be Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I have, I guess, a question and a follow-up. The first one, I guess, on Supplies, Enrique, I don't want to use the word stabilized, but we've been down 7%, I think, for a couple of quarters in a row now. Do you think we're starting to hit a bottom over here? And how should we think about the Supplies trajectory as we go through fiscal '20? And any feedback you've had from your customers and suppliers, I guess, broadly, in terms of the business model transition and the preference they have over here? Enrique Lores : Sure. So let me give -- first, let me help to frame the problem that we are facing in Supplies, and then Steve will provide some more data about what we see happening in the future. As we have shared in the past, we have 2 challenges on the Supplies side : First, we have what we call a strategic challenge driven by the growth of clones because of the lower pricing and the access that they have to the online space. But we also have an operational challenge in EMEA driven by the low visibility we had of some inventory in their unmonitored channel, combined with the aggressiveness of the clone competition. And we are making good progress addressing both problems. On the strategy side, we announced our plan in the Securities Analyst Meeting to transform our model by evolving into services, accelerating the growth in big ink and big toner in emerging countries and, at the end of next year, starting to evolve our transactional model into both an end-to-end or a flexible model. On the operational side, we have also made good progress reducing our inventory, accelerating our growth online, getting better visibility of the inventory in Tier 2s, and as we said in the prepared remarks, changing our control processes to make sure that we have better business management processes in EMEA. Steve? Steven Fieler : Yes. Sure. I mean, I think to start, as I've said many times, our focus remains on operating profit dollars across the entire print ecosystem. But as really specifically to Supplies, Enrique mentioned, operationally, making good progress. We're seeing good indicators. Strategically, we're taking the right long-term steps. Q1 specifically, I guess what I'd say is we're planning prudently. Therefore, we're planning Q1 to kind of be more in the range of where we were in Q4, and that's embedded in our outlook and have confidence in the plan through the remainder of '20, and there's things that we view as tailwinds. We're shifting more of our business to contractual-based models, and that's across both home and office since that's stickier, higher share of revenue for us. We expect to continue to grow our industrial businesses across graphics and 3D. And as Enrique mentioned, we're making the right operational changes in EMEA, but also globally with the new commercial organization. Obviously, we have some offsets. As you're aware, we have declines in the installed base in home. We're very well aware of that and obviously need to mitigate those declines and also the challenges we've discussed in prior quarters on the aftermarket share of Supplies. So we've got some pluses and minuses as we head through the rest of the year. And I guess, kind of -- that's how we view Supplies trajectory for FY '20. Amit Daryanani : Got it. That's really helpful. And I guess my follow-up, Steve, for you. $4 billion free cash flow this year, extremely impressive. I think it was better than what you guys were targeting. Can you just maybe bridge this for me and everyone, $4 billion in fiscal '19 to $3 billion in fiscal '20, kind of what are the puts and takes? And I'm assume -- and really to understand how much of the delta over here is transitory in nature versus structural. That would be helpful. Steven Fieler : Sure. So I've got a lot of confidence in delivering at least $3 billion, and that's our outlook for FY '20. If you just look back over the past 4 years, we've averaged a little bit over $3.5 billion each year. And this year, in particular, we do have a headwind, primarily as it relates to restructuring of roughly $400 million. As I mentioned at SAM, there's some other onetime favorabilities we saw in FY '19 that we don't expect to repeat. That being said, given where we ended cash conversion cycle in FY '19, I would view CCC is actually a help year-over-year. Our outlook for FY '20 is minus 33 days, and we finished FY '19 at minus 31. We'll need to see how the PS volume plays out in the second half. And I would note that the seasonality this year in PS may be different, given some of the industry dynamics. But altogether, I got a high degree of confidence in delivering the at least $3 billion on it. Operator : The next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : I know you talked -- you said you won't talk about Xerox, so I won't ask that specifically, but in the conversations you've had back and forth and the letters, a couple of times, there's been a mention of strong balance sheet and share repurchase. So I guess, maybe can you take a minute to just talk about how you view your capital structure, uses of cash and, I don't know, your thoughts on sort of where investors are leaning or what the Board is thinking these days? And then I have a follow-up. Steven Fieler : And maybe just for starters, I do want to repeat maybe some of my comments at SAM and then sort of talk about where we are. As you're aware, we did update our long-term return-of-capital target at our Securities Analyst Meeting to return approximately 75%. That's our long-term target. And really, this is about a steady return profile for investors and supporting our business strategy. For FY '20 specifically, we're targeting at least 75% return, and that was what we said at the time, given our stock price significantly undervalued the business, and we have confidence in our outlook. We also indicated that our Board approved an incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization. So we do have the flexibility to be opportunistic. Kind of bring it back up to, I guess, the point of your question around capital allocation, which we do view as an extremely critical management responsibility. In our framework, we'll remain disciplined. We have evaluated, we'll continue to evaluate ways with our balance sheet to create additional shareholder value. That could include M&A. It could include additional return of capital. As always, we'll compare the options using a return risk-adjusted view of each opportunity. Enrique Lores : And Shannon, let me emphasize the confidence we have in our plan. We explained our strategy during the Securities Analyst Meeting. We are making progress, and we are very confident in our ability to create value for shareholders, which is our key priority. Shannon Cross : And then maybe if you can talk a bit about the A3 market, what you're seeing there, competition and how some of your initiatives are going. Enrique Lores : Sure. So A3 is a key element of our contractual plan. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we are making very good progress. In a flat market, we are growing double digit. And if we focus for a second on A3, we have grown 5%, where the market is barely flat. So very good progress. And I think this is really important because as we look at the future of the print business and the need to change, the opportunity we have to continue to expand and change the business model, growing in contractual is critical for us going forward. And this is really where our focus is and where really our focus will continue to be in the incoming quarters. Operator : The next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : I have a question and a follow-up as well. I was wondering if you could comment specifically on channel inventory over the course of this year. So specifically, if I were to look at this day a year ago versus today, how significant was your drawdown in channel inventory in terms of weeks? And what impact did that have on Supplies revenue growth this quarter -- this year, excuse me, in fiscal '19? And do you believe that Supplies revenue growth will be better in fiscal '20 than '19? And I'll do my follow-up after. Steven Fieler : So I'm assuming this is about the Supplies channel inventory and not channel inventory broadly. So let me kind of comment on where the Supplies channel inventory went this year. So throughout FY '19, we have reduced our channel inventory dollars by over $100 million. This is more than what we initially estimated. So we continue to make good progress. This includes both Tier 1 and parts of Tier 2, and note that we don't have complete visibility into the entire ecosystem. And so things are getting better. We do know, at the same time, the EMEA market has softened. So it's hard to bifurcate or specifically quantify how much of that channel inventory reduction was a result of starting the year off in a high position versus what was happening in the marketplace. What you should sort of think about it is at least $100 million channel inventory reduction on a year-over-year basis. And as I mentioned, as it relates to FY '20, we do feel like there's things that are going our way from the contractual models, industrial businesses and the operational changes we've made, but we also have headwinds. And so we have to manage through the headwinds around the home side, have to manage the headwinds around ensuring we're protecting our share as much as possible. So I think those are all factored into how we're thinking about FY '20. We're taking a very prudent view, and that prudent view is factored into not just our Q1, but our overall FY '20 outlook. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. So no explicit comments on whether up or down relative to fiscal '19 in terms of what's baked into your guidance, Steve? Steven Fieler : As I said, I think we've got some headwinds and tailwinds. What we're driving is operating profit dollars in our print business. Obviously, supplies is a big part of it, but so is the shift more to hardware. We saw our hardware gross margins expand in Q4 as an example, and adding more services to the portfolio. So all together is what we're driving to focus on OP dollars versus just Supplies specifically. Toni Sacconaghi : And then just to follow up, you've stated repeatedly on the call that you believe your shares are undervalued and that you outlined a highly credible strategy at SAM. But prior to the Xerox announcement, the stock has traded at $17 or less since the Securities Analyst Meeting. And so I guess my question to you is, what is it that you think you see that investors are missing, given where the stock has traded at following SAM? And if you really were so confident that the stock has been structurally undervalued throughout the year, why did your SAM plan not include your deciding to take on debt and much more aggressively repurchase your shares? Enrique Lores : So let me start, and then I think Steve will complement. I think the key thing that we see, Toni, is a gap between the current value of the stock and the net present value of the cash flow projections that we have in our plan. And this is what drives our comment and thinking about being undervalued. What we have proven this quarter and we have proven in the past is that we have a clear ability to execute and that we deliver on our commitment. And our expectation is that by executing every quarter and meeting our guidelines, we will be seeing that gap to be reduced. Steven Fieler : And maybe just to add to that. What we did say at SAM, we did have a change in terms of our fiscal year '20 return of capital, where we communicated that we expect to return at least 75% and also announced an incremental authorization of share repurchase from the Board of $5 billion to give us the flexibility and opportunity to repurchase more shares. To note, in Q4, we did have additional material nonpublic information. I think that's obvious now. And so we were not as active in the market as we would like to have been. Operator : The next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Huberty : How are you thinking about first quarter '20 revenue performance versus normal seasonality, given the Intel comments about component constraints and your comments about not expecting an improvement in Supplies rate of decline? And then I have a follow-up. Steven Fieler : Yes. So we are assuming that the CPU supply will constrain our revenue in Q1. And if you think about it on a sequential basis, certainly, in the Personal Systems business, we would expect to have declines from Q4 to Q1 above the normal seasonal patterns. That being said, well, this is more of a revenue impact than profit impact for the quarter as we expect our mix should be better. Kathryn Huberty : Okay. And then just thinking more broadly over the course of fiscal '20. Steve, you had mentioned that you see the potential for different seasonality than in the past. How long are you expecting that the PC market strength associated with the Win 10 upgrade lasts? Does that continue well into the first half of the year? And how do you see seasonality falling off in the back half as customers complete those upgrades? Enrique Lores : Yes. Katy, I think the seasonality for next year is going to be impacted by the availability of CPUs. What we know now is that availability is going to be constrained for the first full half, and therefore, that will be having an impact on the seasonality between the second and the first half. So this is something that you really should have in mind as you build the projections for next year. Steven Fieler : And as it relates then to the Win 7, Win 10 refresh, it could be that these current supply constraints actually indeed help prolong the Win 10 refresh. And so there's a lot of dynamics going on, and that's why I think seasonal patterns are likely to be affected, both from a supply, but also on the potential extension of the Win 10 refresh. Operator : The next question is from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : I have a question and a follow-up as well. Just sticking there, Steve, some of the distributors actually believe, with regards to Win 10 and PC -- PC Win 10 refresh, that there's actually a long way to go for small and medium business customers, which is a meaningful part of your customer base, and not just chipset-related, but related to those -- those folks just tend to put off larger purchases as long as they possibly can. Do you have enough visibility to agree with that view or disagree with that view? And then I have a follow-up as well. Steven Fieler : I think, in general, we would agree with that view. I mean, there's a large installed base with PCs more than 4 years old. In our assessment, we're a little over 1/3 -- about 1/3 of which are still on Win 7. So there's an opportunity for upgrades. There's an opportunity for upgrades. We're seeing -- and Alex described this at our Analyst Meeting, that PCs are being used by this generation versus prior generations, and they're also using them for specific experiences. But -- so we see the TAM and our ability to gain share as a good opportunity, not to mention our ability to continue improving our mix. But the short of it is, we still think that there's some life here on that Win 7, Win 10 refresh that will extend. Enrique Lores : And let me reinforce his comments. I think the combination of our innovation and ability to execute have proven that -- have allowed us to grow faster than the market, and this is what we expect to continue to do going forward. Ananda Baruah : That's really helpful, guys. And just as a quick follow-up. You mentioned new -- for Printing, new models out by the end of fiscal -- I think you said -- you actually said '20. So could you clarify if that's fiscal '20 or calendar '20? New models for the new printer model, a new printer -- new hardware for the new printer model. Can you clarify if that's fiscal '20 or calendar? And then just how does that fit in -- I guess the broader question is, how does that fit into you guys being able to really make an impact with the business model shift, waiting for those new models? Enrique Lores : So let me start from the second question and then I will go back to the details of the first. As we shared during SAM, the change of business model in print is driven by 3 different vectors. First is a shift into services, both into managed print services and Instant Ink. This offers a better value proposition to customers, and this is a change that we have been driving for some time in the past and where we are growing double digit. Second element of the change is the growth in emerging countries of the big ink and big toner category. Big ink has been in the market for some time. We are growing. And we are the only company that offers a big toner solution, and we have continued the rollout of this solution during the last month. And only the last part of the change is really driven by the new model for transactional customers. This new model, as you said, will be available in the market at the end of the year during our calendar Q4. Operator : Your next question is from Matt Cabral with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Matthew Cabral : Enrique, maybe to pick up on your last answer. You mentioned the initial rollout of big ink and big toner in other emerging markets. Just wondering if you could talk about what the initial customer and competitive response has been so far, and just how you're thinking about the geographic rollout of that model more broadly across your portfolio. Enrique Lores : Sure. So the reception has been positive. As I said before, big ink has been in the market for some time and we have been growing our share. Big toner is a category that we are creating, and we started the launch a few months ago. And as we go into more countries, we continue to see the growth. Reception is very positive because in those countries, usually, consumption is high. We have lower share of [ original ] supply. And therefore, for us, it's a better model and it's also a better model for our customers. Matthew Cabral : And then, Steve, on Personal Systems, margins were once again above 5% in the quarter. Just wondering if you could bridge how much of the year-over-year improvement was the tailwinds from component pricing versus just other underlying improvement, and just how we should think about that impact from component pricing as we move through fiscal '20. Steven Fieler : Yes, it's fair to assume that some level of the profit margin rate in dollars did come from that. But it really is on the backs of how we execute our strategy and overall pricing discipline. There's a lot of puts and takes to pricing. Obviously, commodities have been favorable for us. Overall, currency has been a headwind for us. And so as you take it all into consideration, in addition to the competitive dynamics, it's hard to specifically quantify how much of that sort of exceptional performance was due to the commodities. As we sort of think about FY '20, certainly even from Q4 to Q1, we'd expect the commodity costs to be a bit more stable. And therefore, I don't expect as much tailwind in Q1 and certainly as we enter into the second half as we saw this year. That being said, we continue to have a more structural opportunity to improve our mix. And again, the team deserves a lot of credit for remaining disciplined in the overall pricing strategy. Operator : The next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Just kind of building on that last question. I have a follow-up as well. Thinking about setting component pricing to the side and thinking about the mix shift of the business, it does look like your ASP erosion on particularly your notebooks has kind of accelerated here a little bit. I'm just kind of wanting to understand how I would think about the mix shift dynamic underneath of that. Any metrics you can share of how successful you've been in terms of mix shifting within the PC portfolio and where you think the biggest incremental levers are to continue to see that mix shift going forward as component pricing starts to stabilize, and potentially whether or not we should think about ASPs on a blended basis moving higher going forward in PCs? Steven Fieler : So on a full year basis, mix has definitely been a tailwind for us in Q4 specifically and, as you point out, on notebooks, but we did see an ASP decline. That's driven by FX. So that's a certain part of it. At the total print -- PS level, that's got 2 points, and then rate was 2 points. When we look at the rate specifically, and I touched on this in my prior comments, but the overall industry-wide pricing adjustments in the market due to the commodity cost dynamics in certain product categories like notebooks, pricing is also dependent upon the supply availability that you get. And so all that together is really what drove ASP down year-over-year in Q4. In terms of upside potential, I'd say we view it as significant over time. And when we think about mix, the good news for HP is we're under-indexed in such favorable parts of the PC marketplace. You think about displays and accessories, you think about premium categories. In gaming, which we grew double digits this past quarter. You think about services. And so all of that, we view as more structural long-term tailwind for us. But in the near term, yes, we're facing so many dynamics, Intel being another one, as an example, and the overall supply that we get. So -- but when we think long term, a lot of potential upside on our mix as we can continue to drive these growth initiatives. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Okay. That's perfect. And as a follow-up, kind of that Intel comment. The CPU shortage situation has kind of persisted for much longer than what I think anybody would have expected. I'm just curious of how you guys have kind of thought about mitigating that impact in the portfolio. There are seemingly more competitive alternatives out there in the CPU market today. I'm just curious of how you see or what you think the explanation is for the CPU shortage. And whether or not there's other ways to potentially bridge the impact of revenue here, what seemingly looks like it's going to persist here, as you say, through the first half of 2020 at this point? Enrique Lores : So yes, you're right that we have been in this situation for about a year now. As I said before, we expect it to continue for probably at least 2 other quarters. I think the question about the why is probably a better question to ask to Intel than to us. What I can tell you, though, is that we continue to be committed to use multiple CPU providers. We are working with other vendors. We have been growing the mix of other categories. But Intel is still a very large part of our portfolio and, therefore, when there are shortages, we need to navigate through those and manage our business that way. Steven Fieler : And just 1 other mitigation factor. I'm kind of repeating my earlier comment, but it's important to reiterate, and that is we do expect a better mix of units, which should help mitigate the profit impact of this. While there may be revenue, less so on the bottom line. Enrique Lores : I think we are running out of time now. So I want to thank everyone for joining us today and taking the time to be here, and I'd like to emphasize the confidence that we have in our strategy and the multiple levers that we have to create value. We are -- we have been and we will be relentless in managing costs and investing to create long-term value. And we know how to manage through the current dynamics, which is what -- exactly what we have been doing during the last years. We will continue to execute our strategy with rigor, and we will keep our focus to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Beth Howe : Good afternoon. I'm Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations for HP Inc., and I'd like to welcome you to today's conference call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Fieler, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available on our website shortly after the call for approximately 1 year.  We posted the releases and the accompanying slide presentations for both our fiscal 2020 first quarter earnings and HP's value creation plan we are announcing today on our Investor Relations web page at investor.hp.com. During the presentation of our value creation plan, we will be webcasting the accompanying slides.  As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers in these materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions and the other disclaimers and notes included in the materials accompanying today's presentation. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available now and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, and HP's other SEC filings.  During this webcast, unless otherwise specifically noted, all comparisons are year-on-year comparisons with the corresponding year-ago period. For historical financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations.  And now I'll turn it over to Enrique. Enrique Lores : Thank you, Beth, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. HP made 2 important announcements today. First, we shared our Q1 earnings results that demonstrate our incredibly strong foundation. We also announced a 3-year value creation plan that reflects the significant opportunities ahead. We have a lot to cover today, and frankly, I've been looking forward to this call for some time.  We have a winning plan. Since becoming CEO of HP 4 months ago, my focus has been to deliver on the strategic priorities I outlined during our investor meeting last year. When I took you through our plans to advance, disrupt and transform, I made clear that we have multiple levers to drive shareholder value. And this quarter's results show that our plan is working.  On the call today, we will first cover Q1 earnings and then go into detail on our value creation plan. We will also talk about the Xerox proposal and why it undervalues HP and creates risk for our shareholders. But as I said, let me start with Q1.  We are out of the gate very strong. Our team is on a mission to out-innovate, out-execute and outperform. And it was an impressive quarter for HP. We delivered non-GAAP EPS growth of 25%, significantly above our guided range. We have now beat or met our non-GAAP EPS for 17 straight quarters. That's every single quarter since separation. We grew revenue by 1% in constant currency and non-GAAP operating profit dollars by 16%. We generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, and we returned 84% of that to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. These results show that we have the right plans in place to create value. We are advancing our leadership in Personal Systems and Print.  Let me start with Personal Systems, where we grew revenue for the 15th consecutive quarter and we delivered exceptional operating profit. We are creating amazing new experiences for customers while driving profitable growth and outgrowing the market. This team is an execution machine, and we see runway for sustained value creation. We will discuss in more detail shortly.  In Print, we continued making progress against our plans. Instant Ink surpassed 6 million subscribers for the first time. And we saw another quarter of solid growth in Managed Print Services. We're also disrupting industries by leveraging our technology and IP, particularly in graphics and 3D printing. In graphics, we announced an additional $100 million deal with ePac. And in 3D, we continue to make progress, bringing together end-to-end solutions for customers. An example is New Balance and Superfeet. They are offering customized 3D-printed caps for their insoles to consumers. They are using HP's FitStation and Multi Jet Fusion printing technologies.  And as we advance and disrupt, we are transforming the way we work to unlock value. In the first quarter, we continued to drive operational performance by reducing costs and improving efficiency. We transitioned our sales force to a single commercial organization that is helping to accelerate our go-to-market. This includes global harmonization in areas such as pricing, and as we saw in Q1, the ability to allocate supply more effectively across the globe. Most importantly, this transformation is bringing us closer to our customers and partners.  We are aggressively operationalizing our plans to take structural costs out of the business and are executing our plan to deliver 40% of our gross savings by the end of fiscal '20. We will discuss this further in the review of our value plan.  Our Q1 performance gives us great confidence in our plans for 2020 and beyond. Before I turn the call to Steve, I want to briefly address the coronavirus situation. First and foremost, the well-being of our employees, partners, customers and their families is our #1 priority. We are following the processes and protocols outlined by public health authorities. We are also providing resources to assist with the public health response.  From a business perspective, as you all know, the situation is fluid. We are actively working to return to full production as quickly as possible. We are working with our logistics providers to ensure we get the necessary capacity to meet customer demand. Overall, we are viewing the situation as temporary in nature and we are aggressively navigating the challenges.  Let me now turn it over to Steve to walk through the financial results for Q1 and our outlook in more detail. Steven Fieler : Thanks, Enrique. Q1 was a very strong earnings quarter. We once again grew revenue in constant currency, non-GAAP operating profit dollars faster than revenue and non-GAAP EPS even faster. We are off to a strong start with free cash flow, and overall, we are very pleased with our results.  Now let's look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was $14.6 billion, down 1% year-on-year or up 1% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, APJ grew 4%, EMEA was flat and Americas declined 1%. Gross margin was 19.6%, up 180 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by disciplined execution and improved rate in Personal Systems as well as improved Print hardware gross margins.  Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.7 billion, down $104 million sequentially, resulting from significant reductions in SG&A driven by actions taken through our transformation program. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $44 million for the quarter. We delivered very strong non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.65, up $0.13 or 25% year-on-year, with a diluted share count of approximately 1.5 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share exclude net charges totaling $278 million related to amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and other and nonoperating retirement-related credits and other tax adjustments. As a result, Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.46.  At the segment level, in Personal Systems, it was a very strong quarter. Revenue was $9.9 billion, up 2% or 4% in constant currency. By customer segment, commercial revenue was up 7% and consumer revenue was down 7%. By product category, revenue was up 6% for workstations, up 2% for desktops and 1% for notebooks. The team continued to successfully manage our overall product mix as commercial demand remains solid while navigating the CPU supply constraints.  Personal Systems has been consistently delivering profitable growth, share gains and improved mix over time. This, combined with disciplined pricing and supply chain favorability, drove exceptionally strong profitability with operating margins of 6.7% and operating profit dollars up 61% year-on-year to $662 million. Personal Systems OP represented 47% of HP's profit mix for the quarter. In Print, we continue to make progress on our key initiatives, including growing our contractual offerings, gradually shifting more system profitability to hardware and managing supplies, all within a softer print market context. Looking at the details. Q1 total Print revenue was $4.7 billion, down 7% nominally and 6% in constant currency. Print operating margins were 16%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by higher gross margins and reduced OpEx, partially offset by a lower supplies mix.  Commercial hardware revenue was down 1% and consumer hardware revenue was down 13%. Total hardware units were down 10%, with commercial units down 12% and consumer units down 10%. The decline in units was driven by market softness, fewer sprocket units, along with our ongoing strategy to focus on more profitable customers.  First quarter supplies revenue was $3 billion, down 7% in constant currency and in line with our expectations. We are executing against both the operational and strategic plans laid out in prior quarters. Overall, Tier 1 channel inventory levels remained below the ceilings. Let me now turn to our transformation efforts and specifically our cost savings opportunities. In Q1, about 800 people exited the company globally as part of the restructuring activities announced in October 2019. We continue to pursue additional cost savings opportunities in addition to our ongoing productivity efforts. We now have line of sight to $1.2 billion of gross structural cost savings that help mitigate headwinds, create investment capacity and drop significant profits to the bottom line. We will discuss our expected $650 million net OP flow-through in FY '22 later in this call. Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Q1 cash flow from operations and free cash flow were very strong at $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. This gives us confidence that for the full year, we will land free cash flow between $3 billion and $3.5 billion, even with the short-term negative working capital impact from the coronavirus. In Q1, the cash conversion cycle was minus 30 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle is down 1 day. We returned $691 million to shareholders through share repurchases and $256 million via cash dividends in Q1.  Looking ahead to Q2 and FY '20, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. We expect that macroeconomic conditions will remain dynamic as they are today, and we expect our end markets to remain competitive. We're expecting currency to have about a 1% year-over-year negative impact. With regards to the financial impact from the coronavirus, we are factoring in our best assumptions at this time, recognizing that the situation remains highly dynamic. In Q2, we expect a negative impact to our top line, bottom line and free cash flow, although we view the impact as temporary with limited impact to our second half. In total, net of mitigations, we have factored in an $0.08 EPS impact into our Q2 guidance. We are also expecting to have a significant impact to free cash flow in Q2, with negative impacts to working capital due to delayed production and manufacturing timing and back-end loaded revenue linearity. Again, this should be temporary and not materially impact the full year.  Turning to specific Personal Systems assumptions. We expect industry-wide CPU supply constraints to continue to persist, and we expect the cost from the overall basket of components to be less favorable compared to Q1 levels.  In Printing, we're assuming a year-over-year unit market decline, and consistent with our strategy, we will remain focused on profitable customers. We expect operating margins to improve in the second half of the year versus the first half as cost actions are more fully realized.  In addition, for the full year, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate, which is based on our long-term non-GAAP financial projection, to be 16% in FY '20.  Our FY '20 outlook assumes return of capital of at least 75% of free cash flow to shareholders, consistent with our SAM messaging. However, we will talk later about our incremental return of capital plans, which would create upside in FY '20 and are not yet factored into our guidance. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook. We are raising our full year fiscal 2020 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.33 to $2.43 and our full year fiscal '20 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.03 to $2.13. We expect Q2 '20 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.53, inclusive of our best estimates of coronavirus, and Q2 '20 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.50.  And now I would like to hand it back to Enrique to discuss our value plan. Enrique Lores : Thank you, Steve. Our Q1 results show our company with an incredibly strong foundation, and the 3-year value creation plan we are announcing today demonstrates the significant opportunity ahead. We have multiple levers to drive value for our shareholders and a clear set of guiding principles. Specifically, we will intensify our transformation focus in taking costs out, manage our Personal Systems and Print businesses to advance their lead in their market and drive a more aggressive balance sheet and capital allocation approach.  Our new financial outlook is expected to deliver $3.25 to $3.65 of non-GAAP EPS in fiscal year '22. This is underpinned by a rigorous operational plan. This management team has a proven ability to take costs out of the business while maintaining a disciplined investment approach today and for the future. We have also proven that this is a company and a team that delivers on its commitment. This is our culture. The strong earnings announced today are yet another proof point. You have every reason to share our confidence in the company and the opportunities ahead.  Additionally, against this backdrop of strong performance, we believe additional value can be created through consolidation. In fact, instead of talking about being a first mover, we have been a first mover. Our acquisition of Samsung's printer business in 2017 is an important example. However, anything we consider and anything we do must, first and foremost, make sense for HP shareholders. Before I go into more detail on our 3-year plan, let me address the Xerox proposal and why we firmly believe that this is not in the best interest of HP shareholders. The Xerox proposal meaningfully undervalues HP. It creates significant risk, and it compromises the future of HP and the value of HP shares. Simply put, their proposal has a number of fundamental problems.  The first is a flawed value exchange. The Xerox proposal does not reflect the value of our company or the plan that we announced today. The value exchange simply does not work.  The second is that the proposal creates a highly leveraged and irresponsible capital structure. Considering the nature of our business, which operates with a negative cash conversion cycle as well as a macroeconomic cycle, this level of debt creates significant unnecessary risk. It's resulting debt-to-EBITDA ratio would be the highest in the S&P hardware index. A [ debt leader ], as Xerox is proposing, would virtually extinguish the capital returns that have been an important driver of value creation for HP.  The third is the transfer of value from HP shareholders to Xerox shareholders. Their overstated synergies include many of the initiatives and cost-saving activities we are already doing. It is important to keep in mind that there is no overlap between Xerox and over 90% of HP's business. In addition, the Xerox proposal uses our balance sheet's strength to acquire our company, creating value for Xerox shareholders but not for HP's. Beyond these problems, we are looking at 2 very different companies. HP is a global leader in both Personal Systems and Print. Xerox has no presence in Personal Systems. Xerox' position in Print is not nearly as robust as HP. We are a technology leader. And with Xerox' exit from the Fuji Xerox joint venture, Xerox has no long-term technology or supply road map. HP has grown by $10.5 billion over the last 3 years. This revenue growth is meaningfully more than Xerox's total company revenue. HP does not need a Xerox combination to create significant value for shareholders.  Now I'm excited to get to the most important news we are sharing today. The plan we are announcing shows the stand-alone value our shareholders can expect from us. More specifically, we expect to grow operating profit by approximately $650 million with realistic market assumptions and roughly flat revenue, to generate $10.7 billion to $11.7 billion of free cash flow and to return $16 billion of capital to shareholders. This represents approximately 50% of HP's current market cap and at least $8 billion to be returned in the first 12 months. Altogether, these plans would deliver non-GAAP EPS of $3.25 to $3.65 in fiscal year '22 compared to the $2.24 we delivered just last year.  Our significant earnings per share growth will be driven by the principles I outlined at the beginning : aggressive structural cost reductions and ongoing productivity savings; disciplined management of our Personal Systems and Print businesses to lead in their market; and a more aggressive balance sheet and capital allocation approach. Now I want to spend some time talking about each of these EPS drivers. I will start with one of the core elements of our value plan, which is to transform our company with a relentless focus on costs. As we outlined at our Investor Day, we are driving efficiencies to generate structural cost savings. We have taken and are taking important actions that are driving measurable benefits.  We expect our current cost reduction program to increase from the $1 billion announced in October 2019 to a revised plan of $1.2 billion of gross annualized run rate structural cost savings. We are also announcing today that approximately $650 million of these structural cost savings are expected to flow through to operating profit. As a result of these actions, as previously announced, we're removing 7,000 to 9,000 positions or 13% to 16% of our total workforce. And our restructuring dollars remain unchanged.  Complementing these structural savings, we will continue to drive productivity actions across the company. We treat this as a separate bucket that we do each and every year to maintain our competitive position in the market. These include vendor management, material cost reduction, logistic efficiencies and more. Structural and productivity savings combined can generate more than $2 billion of savings as a stand-alone company.  We have clear line of sight to deliver on these savings. We have defined projects across the organization to support our target with clear owners and time lines. Let me share some specific examples. I mentioned before the change that we are making in our sales organization. We have also consolidated marketing activities under one central global team. This is driving improved marketing spend efficiency and effectiveness. We are also creating efficiency in our business units and operations. We are changing our development processes, creating R&D centers of excellence and simplifying our hardware, software and firmware platform. We have also embarked on a process to optimize the location of our factories and distribution network. We are reducing the cost of our service delivery by reducing the number of call centers, building tools to enable remote support and aggressively improving our product quality. We will be driving down real estate cost by reducing the number of locations and increasing the mobility of our workforce.  And finally, we are redefining and digitizing processes to improve efficiency of our back-office work. And at the same time, this creates better experiences for our customers, partners and employees. We anticipate that we will be achieving 40% of the annualized savings in fiscal year '20, 75% in fiscal year '21, and we will reach 100% of the savings during fiscal year '22. Reducing cost is a never-ending task, and we will continue to look for opportunities to drive efficiencies.  Let me talk now about our business segments. Let's start with Personal Systems, where we are creating amazing new experiences for customers while driving profitable growth. Personal Systems represent approximately 2/3 of our revenue. As we discussed, we continue to outgrow the market, grow revenue and drive profit. This is a large and growing business that has further expansion opportunity with the next generation of customers and exciting new compute models.  We have a winning strategy that's anchored in premium design, security and innovation to continue gaining share in higher-value categories. That's exactly what we have done the past 3 years, and we are still under-indexed in higher-margin segments.  We're also growing the lifetime value of our installed base by broadening our ecosystem of displays and accessories and accelerating in services. And we have demonstrated meaningful progress in driving cost advantage across our platforms and our end-to-end delivery system. Looking forward, we expect to grow Personal Systems revenue at or better than market while expanding our long-term operating margin target to 3.5% to 5.5%. We feel great about the trajectory of this business and our team's ability to execute.  Turning to Print. We have an incredible business in the large $200 billion plus print market. We are the market leader in size, scale, profit and innovation across office, home and graphics printing. And in a mature industry, everyone wants to be a leader. At the same time, we are still under-indexed in attractive categories like contractual in office printing. And as we drive a more consistent customer experience across our full print portfolio, we are confident that we will achieve significant cost savings and productivity gains.  We continue to execute on our strategy to increase supplies share and to evolve our business model over time by growing contractual sales and optimizing system profitability with improved hardware margins. In addition, as I previously mentioned, we will also expand our solutions in graphics, 3D printing and digital manufacturing. This plays an important role in our long-term plan. And HP's decades of investment have created a leading portfolio of technology and intellectual property that we are monetizing to create new sources of value beyond hardware across key industrial markets.  Across our Print segment, we are executing a strategy that will advance our leadership, disrupt industries and transform our business to improve our profitability. As a result, we are setting a long-term operating margin target for Print at 16% to 18%. Let me now hand the call over to Steve, who will go into more details on the financial plan, starting with optimizing the balance sheet. Steven Fieler : Thanks, Enrique. An important part of our value creation plan is driving a more aggressive balance sheet and capital allocation approach. We are establishing a new capital structure model with a target gross leverage ratio between 1.5 to 2x gross debt to EBITDA. In addition, we have announced a new capital return program, both in the short term and long term, which would utilize HP's balance sheet for the benefit of HP's shareholders. Our capital structure will still preserve our ability to pursue disciplined and accretive M&A and to continue to grow our dividend at least in line with earnings. The plan builds on HP's strong history of returning capital to shareholders. Looking forward, we expect to return approximately $16 billion to shareholders over the next 3 years, with at least $8 billion of shares repurchased in the 12 months following our 2020 Annual Shareholder Meeting.  To support this plan, the Board has increased the total share repurchase authorization to $15 billion, an increase from the $5 billion we announced in October 2019. This increased capital return will be funded by deploying excess cash on HP's balance sheet and available debt capacity. We remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade rating. We are also increasing our long-term return of capital target from approximately 75% to 100% of free cash flow, unless higher return opportunities emerge.  We have a strong value plan, reflecting the significant opportunities across our business. It is a plan built on realistic assumptions, and it is a plan that combines operational earnings growth with enhanced return of capital to shareholders.  I'll bridge our non-GAAP EPS from FY '19 to FY '22 in 3 parts, starting with the earnings contribution from our Print and Personal Systems business segments. We're expecting an increase of $0.41, plus or minus, from FY '19 to FY '22. This assumes approximately flat company revenue during this period, consistent with the growth across our weighted portfolio TAM. We remain well positioned to continue outgrowing our markets, improving our mix into higher growth and margin categories all while managing improved supplies revenue declines over the 3-year period. Importantly, the primary driver of the expected operating profit growth is the high-confidence $650 million net flow-through from our transformation cost takeout program.  Second, we had $0.35, plus or minus, from shares and other using our previously guided 75% capital return. This base operational plan would generate between $2.90 to $3.10 non-GAAP EPS in FY '22 before any enhanced return of capital.  Finally, we added the benefit from the incremental capital return program announced today, the upfront share repurchases, along with a 100% return of free cash flow target over the years ahead. This would generate another $0.45, plus or minus. In total for FY '22, non-GAAP EPS range is between $3.25 and $3.65.  We hold ourselves to high standards, and it is the HP way to consistently achieve the goals we set. We take a disciplined approach to capital allocation, including M&A and return of capital. We have experience acquiring and consolidating as well as separating and divesting, and we have returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders. And we've done all of this while executing globally across both Personal Systems and Print portfolio and creating new businesses and revenue streams. That's the foundation we have built at HP. It's one that you can trust, and it is grounded in the purpose-driven values of making sustainable impact and doing business the right way. Now I'll turn the call back to Enrique. Enrique Lores : Thank you, Steve. The details we have shared today show that HP has a path to attractive value creation and a compelling investment thesis through execution of our stand-alone plan. Additionally, we believe consolidation on the right terms could create incremental upside to this plan for HP shareholders. HP is reaching out to Xerox to explore if there is a combination that creates value for HP shareholders that is additive to HP's strategic and financial plans. I'm confident in this next chapter of HP. We will be more aggressive, nimble and focused. And we have multiple levers for value creation.  Now let me stop there and open the lines for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Thank you for the detailed explanation of your strategy going forward. I wanted to follow up on the commentary that you made at the end, Enrique, about that you're reaching out to Xerox and I'm curious as to sort of steps. And then also what metrics would you need to see to pursue a deal? And you probably want to talk more generically but just in general, how are you looking at that? And how are you thinking about consolidation overall within the industry? And then I do have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Sure. Thank you, Shannon. I think any conversation we will have needs to address the 3 issues that we outlined during the call. First, we need to make sure that the value exchange between the 2 companies reflect the real value of each of them. Second, the resulting entity needs to have a capital structure that makes sense and that will be able to address the needs of the businesses that we will be running. And third, it needs to be based on synergies that are realistic and that can be achieved. This is a conversation that we think is possible to have at this point, and this is what we have opened the communication -- open the engagement to talk about. Steven Fieler : Just to quickly just double-click for a second on the 3 dimensions that Enrique described. On the first one on the value exchange, just to put it numerically, given our outlook, Xerox' offer today is roughly a 7x PE for HP. And if we look at consensus on Xerox over a similar period, they're, as of last week, in closer to the 9.4x range. So a striking difference in the respective valuations despite the fact if you look at our performance, HP has been growing and Xerox has been declining.  The quick double-click on irresponsible capital structure. There's no hardware company in the S&P index with a leverage beyond 3.5x, and so we view it as irresponsible. Candidly, if we just reflect on the current situation with coronavirus and the working capital required to run our Personal Systems business, it's really important that you have that flexibility in your operating cash as we do today. And then the third one on the synergies, it's important that our investors get the benefit of HP's cost takeout program and not Xerox taking credit for it in terms of the synergies they're claiming. Enrique Lores : And let me add one more thing. Our #1 priority is to execute the plan that we have outlined today. We have an opportunity of creating very strong value for our shareholders, and this is what myself, Steve and the rest of the team are uniquely focused. Shannon Cross : Great. And then I just wanted to clarify that you're taking up your cost reduction to $1.2 billion and specifying $650 million flowing through to the bottom line. Kind of curious as to what you've seen that's incremental that's driving that. And also you mentioned $2 billion over time. Is that a longer-term target? Just any clarity there. Steven Fieler : Yes. So maybe I'll clear up the numbers. So what we announced at SAM in October was a $1 billion gross run rate savings by the end of FY '22. At the time, we did acknowledge that that was to cover business headwinds to invest in the business, and we'd have some drop to the bottom line and we didn't quantify that drop. What we're announcing today is that that $1 billion goes up to $1.2 billion in FY '22 and not by the end of FY '22 and that there would be a $650 million net drop from that.  The confidence comes really from the start out of the gate, given where we see the head count reductions that have taken place thus far, the continued work we've done over the prior 3 months. As we said, we'll always look at taking additional costs out, and we'll communicate them when we have line of sight. And so since we have line of sight, we've increased it to $1.2 billion.  In addition to that, what we didn't specifically quantify in October but it's important for our investors to understand is we also have ongoing productivity initiatives and actions. This takes place every year. It always does at HP, where we see more than $1 billion of productivity. Think about this as vendor management, supplier management, pricing efficiencies, which we drive day in and day out. That's really used more just to make sure that we are competitive in our markets and our business. And so what's really important is the structural cost reductions, and that's now $1.2 billion. Enrique Lores : But as Steve said, as we said in October and we said it today, we will continue to look for opportunities to become more efficient. Removing cost is an activity that never stops, and we will continue to do that and continue to improve the efficiency of the company. Operator : Our next question will come from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Huberty : Commend you on the very aggressive capital return plan. In that context, maybe this is a question for Steve first. If and when the PC market growth turns negative, how do you plan to manage through the negative cash conversion cycle and the potential impact to free cash flow so that you can continue to meet this new share buyback commitment? Steven Fieler : Sure. Yes, I mean it's really a fundamental part of our overall capital structure. And as we said in the prepared remarks, our new target debt or leverage ratio is 1.5 to 2x. It's important that we maintain investment grade, and we have confidence that operating within that range, we'll do so.  And the reason for that is a few-fold, one of which is what you just described. It's important that we can manage across economic cycles and particularly with our Personal Systems business and ensure that we have sufficient cash for operations. Also given what we've announced, we think our capital structure still supports our ability to invest and look at accretive, disciplined, value-based M&A and really take advantage of the financial and debt markets as they arise. Enrique Lores : And let me add one comment. Steve said in the prepared remarks, we have very realistic market assumptions that are supporting this plan. And basically, we are expecting flattish revenue. So this is also an important plan or the confidence that we have about this plan. Kathryn Huberty : So that actually connects to my follow-up. The operational earnings growth over the next 3 years is $0.41. That entirely ties to the $650 million of cost savings. So as you say, there's no revenue growth. There's no benefit from margin expansion as you mix into higher-value PC categories, as the supplies trajectory improves. And so just some context around why you're not betting that operationally, you can grow earnings beyond the cost savings over the next 3 years. Steven Fieler : Yes. I would say, first of all, the plus $650 million is a plus or minus, right? And so we obviously have proven in the past few years our ability to profitably outgrow our market and also do so in categories where we're under-indexed and have higher long-term growth and margin accretive potential. That being said, we did want to take a realistic view of the opportunities in markets that we see. We do see and would expect certain parts of our portfolio to continue to grow. And we'd expect there will be parts of our portfolio that we continue to expect some declines, supplies being one of them, although we do expect that the supplies declines will improve over the period. Operator : Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you for the presentation and all the detail. I'm wondering, you did talk about reaching out to Xerox to explore a combination. But it doesn't sound like you're open to being purchased by Xerox at any price, let's say, $30 a share or more simply because under any raised price, you would still have the same grievances. Is that correct? So are you -- if I literally follow your logic, it sounds like you're not open to being purchased by Xerox and Xerox having a majority control of the company under -- at any price. Is that fair? Enrique Lores : At this point, Toni, I don't think that who buys what is a real conversation. The real conversation is to make sure that if the 2 companies get together, we address the issues that we outlined during the call. First, we need to make sure that the valuation of the 2 companies is fair based on the value that both companies are going to be bringing to the joint entity. We need to make sure that the resulting capital structure makes sense for the businesses where we will be operating. And we need to make sure also that there is a fair, a clear assessment of what the synergies are. This is I think the important conversation for our shareholders. Once we clarify that, then who, how are things that will be discussed after that. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. And if I could just follow up. Could you, A, just clarify what your expected supplies growth is through '22 in terms of decline per year? And then maybe you can comment on what feedback you've received from investors about this proposal. And the reason I ask is you're effectively saying what we outlined in October was $3 a share in 2022. And the stock market reacted with a share price of $17 or $18 for HPQ. Now you are effectively taking that up to $3.50, but it's not dramatically different and your stock price is up 33% since then. So I'm wondering, A, what feedback did you receive from investors over the last couple of months since the Xerox offer has come to be? And why do you believe that the market will view earnings that are 15% higher as being an entity that's dramatically higher value than the price they were willing to ascribe to the company shortly after the Analyst Day? Steven Fieler : So let me take a first crack at that. So I think there's a couple of things just to start with, the first of which is just to remind everyone, we did over-deliver on our Q4 results after our Analyst Day, and we significantly over-delivered on our Q1 results announced today as well as now 2 increases in our full year '20 outlook. So that's point one.  Point two is what we didn't share in October, what we are sharing today is the underlying financial plan that is consistent with the strategy described at our Security Analyst Meeting. And that plan, in and of itself, is why we bridged it the way we did, would deliver between a $2.90 to $3.10 non-GAAP EPS in FY '22 before any of the incremental increased return of capital discussed today. So I think those are 2 important data points that have not been shared with our -- I guess the earnings beat has, but the value plan itself, this is the first time we're talking about it in this level of detail. And I think it's important facts and assumptions that would support the investor dialogue, which we'd continue to have and will continue to have. Enrique Lores : And when I got this question in the past, I always said that we were undervalued because our financial plan was clearly delivering higher value. And this is one of our objectives of sharing this today because now this analysis can be done openly, and it will clearly reflect what is the real value of this company. Operator : Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani of Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I have a few questions as well, and thanks for providing all the details over here. I guess, Enrique, when I think about the updated capital allocation narrative, I'm wondering, how does M&A fit into your thought process as you go forward? And specifically a question we get way too often is, will HP turn around and look to acquire Xerox at some point? So I'd love to understand, how do you view M&A broadly? If you can talk about this perhaps with Xerox specifically. Enrique Lores : Well, let me start and then maybe Steve will provide more detail. The way we have designed the capital structure will provide us flexibility to continue to drive accretive M&A with solid return on investments that will be aligned to the strategy that we have described. We have increased the debt that we are going to be taking, but still, we will have enough room to drive the M&A that we will consider appropriate. Steven Fieler : Yes. I mean the only thing I would add is, again, we intend to operate between the 1.5 to 2x leverage ratio. It's important for us to maintain investment grade, and we believe that still gives us the capacity to do what's still an important part of our strategy, which is M&A. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then if I just come back to the fundamentals in the quarter that you guys just reported. Supply that you feel like it's starting to stabilize, the down 6%, 7% range for a few quarters now. I'd love to understand your perspective on how fiscal '20 stacks up, especially because compares start to get ease in the back half with supplies. And then any feedback you're getting from your customers channel with the new pricing model? Steven Fieler : Sure. I won't kind of give any specific guidance as it relates to supplies revenue other than potentially to provide some color commentary. Certainly, as it relates to our 3-year plan, as I mentioned, we are still assuming the supplies revenue will decline, but we expect it to decelerate and improve over time. The reason for that, there's a few things.  First of all, we're expecting that the supply share will improve throughout the period, reasons being our strategy. We're shifting more to contractual-based models, both in the home and office. Enrique commented that Instant Ink has now over 6 million subscribers. Number two, we expect to continue growing our industrial businesses, graphics, 3D. Number three, we expect to shift more of our customers to our end-to-end systems. Now this is going to evolve over time but that certainly should help supply share.  And finally, operationally, we're driving changes we've talked about in EMEA but also executing some of the wins we saw on the ink side, where we've improved our supply share into the toner side. So those should all help our supplies trajectory over time. I would call out that we still have declines in installed base and especially in home. So there's definitely offsets to that, which is why we're still expecting a decline throughout the period. Enrique Lores : But let me emphasize one of the points that Steve made. As a consequence of the strategies that we are driving, we expect the Print business to be a much stronger business 3 years from now than it is today. We will have fewer unprofitable customers, and we are sharing some details about that today. We will have higher share of supply. We will have better hardware margins. We will have a higher percentage of contractual business, both for consumers and for businesses. And there will be a higher mix of growth businesses like graphics and 3D. So as we execute our strategy, we are really driving a significant improvement of the quality of the Print business. Operator : And our next question will come from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : Two, if I could as well. Could you just talk about with regards to coronavirus, specifically what's being impacted from a componentry perspective as well as a production perspective? That would be helpful. And then I have a quick follow-up. Enrique Lores : Sure. Let me start. So as we talk about the coronavirus, always our first thoughts is our employees, partners, customers and their families because we have a large number of them in the countries that are being affected -- impacted. At the same time, we need to acknowledge that if I focus on the business side, the situation is fluid. And our #1 priority -- our #1 problem is manufacturing capacity, both for Personal Systems, for Print hardware and supply.  We are working very aggressively with our manufacturing partners and suppliers. I personally have been in contact with most of the CEOs to accelerate the recovery. We are seeing some improvement, but as Steve mentioned, we are expecting still to see some impact during Q2. Steven Fieler : Yes, I'll just -- I think it's important to reiterate that this is a dynamic situation. Our guidance just factors in the best information that we have today. We do view the situation as ultimately a temporary situation that we'll work ourselves through. As Enrique indicated, we are expecting that it would impact both our Personal Systems and Print business, hardware and potentially supplies as well. And in Q2, the impact will be felt across our units, revenue, profit and free cash flow. We have factored in, as I said in my remarks, an $0.08 net impact, a negative impact in our Q2 outlook. And we're not expecting any material impact in the second half. So that's what's assumed in our guidance.  As it relates to free cash flow, I do want to note that given the delayed manufacturing and production, that is likely to make Q2 to be a more back-end loaded revenue quarter, and therefore, be negative to cash flow as well as from an inventory and days payable outstanding perspective, the timing of the manufacturing could also pressure working capital there. So it is likely to have a negative impact to our Q2 free cash flow results, again, temporary. Ananda Baruah : That's helpful. And just on cash, if I could squeeze one more in. What -- how -- is there an opportunity to the cash -- for the cash you'll be using for the share repurchase? And how would you like us to think about that opportunity cost? Steven Fieler : When you say cash, you're talking about cash flow or cash on hand? Ananda Baruah : Sorry. Well, for the cash that you could -- for the cash usage that you'll be using for the share repurchase. I just think that M&A potentially could be somewhat impacted. But would there be any other areas that perhaps you'd kind of pull back on investing in to let it flow to the free cash flow that you would then use for that share repurchase? Steven Fieler : Well, I mean obviously, we'll continue to look for returns-based opportunities to invest in. If we see those, we'll make those investments. If we don't see those, then there's always opportunities to drop more to the bottom line. We'll continue to aggressively lead in our markets, as Enrique said in his remarks. And again, if that leads to upside opportunities, that can drop more to the bottom line. That being said, our 3-year cumulative free cash flow outlook is between $10.7 billion to $11.7 billion. It's one of the strengths that we have seen in the past and would expect going forward, which is we generate a lot of cash at HP. Operator : And our next question will come from Paul Coster of JPMorgan. Paul Coster : First up, can you just talk us through the time line here for when the annual meeting is and when you'll have the discussion with Xerox and when you will take on the debt? And to what extent in this fiscal year the debt will be sort of front-loaded to enable the purchase of shares? Enrique Lores : Well, in terms of the date of the shareholder meeting, we will be publishing our proxy statement in the next week, and then it's when the date will be defined. In terms of the engagement with the Xerox team, it's something that has actually already started. And we will be reporting on that, but we will have to based on regulatory obligations. Steven Fieler : In terms of the debt, I mean the debt and the actual execution of the increased share repurchase, first and foremost, we're going to get out and engage with our shareholders. And we'll provide greater clarity in terms of kind of the timing and ultimately the structure and debt levels as we get closer to the execution. Paul Coster : Got it. Okay. My follow-up question is obviously, this is a really interesting value creation plan that you've outlined here. And if it's a good idea now, why wasn't it a good idea back in October? And what do you think you may have done by way of compromise in order to bring out the plan now versus back then? Enrique Lores : Sure. So first of all, let me remember that when we had the investor meeting in October, I was still not the CEO and I have been the CEO of the company only for 4 months. During these 4 months, I have worked with the team, [ and all the team ], hard work to really look for ways to accelerate the value that we can provide to our shareholders. This is what we have presented today. And at the same time, we wanted to be able to demonstrate our ability to execute in Q1. We have done this today, presenting very strong results, and this is why we are having this conversation today. Steven Fieler : I would want to add that in the October time frame, we did announce the Board's approval for the largest share repurchase authorization in the history of HPQ as a stand-alone company, both in terms of dollars as well as a percentage of our market cap because as we said at the time, we did view our shares as significantly undervalued. So we did say that at that time. Operator : Our next question will come from Matt Cabral of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Matthew Cabral : In your presentation, you mentioned roughly $1 billion of potential synergies created through the combination with Xerox. Can you just talk a little bit about how you arrived at that number and just the biggest differences you see versus the plan that Xerox has put out there? Enrique Lores : Sure. Let me take the question. So we have done a lot of work internally to, based in public information, trying to estimate those synergies. And also we hired a company that is specialized to validate some of our key assumptions. And we reached kind of the conclusion that Steve mentioned before that synergies are in the range of $1 billion.  I want to remind everybody that the overlap between the 2 companies is relatively small. From our perspective, it's less than 10%. So really, we need to always have that in mind when we talk about synergies. Having said that, around 40% of the synergies will be in cost of goods sold. Around 60% of the synergies are in the OpEx side. This will give you a high-level estimation of the synergies. Steven Fieler : I think it's also important just to reflect upon the flow-through. And what we've heard is that there's an assumption of 100% cost flow-through to the bottom line that Xerox has proposed. It's certainly not anything that's being achieved today and their cost takeout plans. And so I think we've reflected on that. And again, I think it's important that whatever the synergy number is, it's an incremental synergy number and doesn't duplicate the cost plan that HP is already executing and candidly, that Xerox seems to be executing on their side as well. Enrique Lores : And this is -- a fundamental part is we are driving significant costs out of this company, and the value of that needs to go to HP shareholders. This is their money. This is why we think a big part of why the current proposal doesn't work for HP shareholders. Matthew Cabral : Got it. And then really strong EPS upside in the quarter, but it looks like your full year guidance went up by a little bit less than the first quarter beat. Can you just help us understand if there's any pull forward or anything onetime in the first quarter and why we shouldn't expect the margin upside to continue for the balance of the year? Steven Fieler : Yes. So we increased our full year outlook by $0.10. I think what we've demonstrated is we do have multiple levers to drive profit at the company, and our outlook does assess the various risks and opportunities that we see. Maybe just a few high-level points. The first is we have factored into our guidance, what you see in Q2, the impact of coronavirus. We see it as a temporary issue at this point. Again, it's dynamic. But that is both in Q2 and does reflect our overall full year guide.  In the second half, Personal Systems is going to have a tougher compare, whereas Print should show a better compare and year-over-year improvement. But also second half, and I think what's important is we do expect to see more of the structural cost reductions and savings, and we have increasing confidence in that. You factor all those elements together, which is why we increased the full year by $0.10, and we've got confidence in delivering that, albeit the coronavirus remains dynamic. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeriel Ong of Deutsche Bank. Kanghui Ong : So I wanted to just put together a couple of breadcrumbs together and just kind of paint a picture here. So it seems like -- you mentioned you're reaching out to Xerox to talk about a combination, yet you've mentioned a repurchase, which appears like you're required to raise some debt if you're to complete in the quick manner you guided to. And finally, there's a commitment to this gross debt to EBITDA of 1.5 to 2x. How do we reconcile the idea that if you were to pursue a combination with Xerox, a combination of deal and repurchase could push you over the leverage that you've committed to? Steven Fieler : Well, I guess first and foremost, we've got a strong balance sheet, and we don't necessarily look at this as an either/or proposition. I mean our return of capital and capital structure is really designed to return significant capital, also preserve the optionality around M&A if it's ROI-based and disciplined and accretive to the company that could create value for our shareholders. Clearly, any specifics or hypotheticals really matter about what any potential transaction could look like, so won't comment on that. But our capital allocation will remain disciplined and responsible and strategically deployed to drive value for the company. And we think that 1.5 to 2x target leverage will allow us to do so. Kanghui Ong : Got it. Appreciate that. And one fundamental one, if I can. You mentioned a raise on both sides, Personal Systems and Print margins. I want to ask versus perhaps back in October. What gives you confidence in that raise? Steven Fieler : Yes. Our long-term margins for Personal Systems is fundamentally driven by the structural improvements we have made and would expect to be making in our mix. You've seen that underlying our results over the past many quarters, certainly, and the most recent quarter is also helped by some of the supply chain cost favorability. But the mix really helps and then the cost takeout. The cost takeout should help both Personal Systems and Print, both in the short term and long term. Operator : Our next question will come from Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Rajagopal Kamesh : This is RK on behalf of Rod. I wanted to ask about the Windows 10 cycle. Where do you think we are? And could you comment on your expectations for commercial PC trends going forward? Enrique Lores : Sure. As we have said before, we are very confident in the trajectory of the Personal Systems business going forward. We -- there is a very large installed base that is -- that we can drive and upgrade to some of the new volumes, some of the new units that we have. And we think that we have an opportunity to mitigate any impact that the Windows 10 refresh may have going forward. Steven Fieler : Yes. And what we saw in Q1 was our demand remained solid certainly on the commercial side, and so I think that's an important factor. Ironically, I think the coronavirus may ultimately push out some of the Win 10 refresh time lines, given some of the constraints we're going to see in Q2, so that could support a better second half than we originally anticipated. Enrique Lores : Additionally, to some of the shortages we have seen on processors during the last quarter, so this really is smoothing out the transition to the new system. Rajagopal Kamesh : And on the coronavirus impacts, does your guidance include any impacts to demand outside of China? Steven Fieler : No, the guide really reflects the economic conditions as we saw today. And the demand impact was really China-based as well as the supply chain and logistics impact from the China production and manufacturing. Enrique Lores : And as we said before, the biggest impact is driven by the supply chain impact. That, of course, will have an impact in sales all over the world. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Enrique Lores for any closing remarks. Please go ahead. Enrique Lores : So thank you, everybody, for joining. As you have seen during the call, we are very confident in the plans we have laid out today. We will build on our disciplined and sustained cost reduction actions to drive overall operating profit and cash flow across our business. And we will keep evolving so we can become a better, leaner, more digitally-driven company. My #1 priority is to execute the plan that we have outlined today. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect. Enrique Lores : I am Enrique Lores, President and CEO of HP. Today, in addition to reporting strong financial results for the first quarter, we're outlining our plan to create value for our shareholders in both the near and long term. In this video, you will meet key members of the team to help you to understand our position of strength and why this is the right team to lead HP forward. HP has a clear strategy to create value for shareholders, and our strategy is working. We're advancing our position in Personal Systems and Print. We are disrupting industries with breakthrough technologies across graphics, 3D printing and digital manufacturing. And we are transforming how we work to continually optimize our cost structure and create the capacity needed to reinvest in innovation. As part of our value creation plan, HP's Board has approved a new capital return policy that we expect will return at approximately $16 billion. This program will utilize our balance sheet for HP shareholders benefit. It will preserve our ability to pursue disciplined M&A as well as to continue to grow our dividend at least in line with earnings. You can also expect us to win the right way. As a leader, I have always believed that how you do things is just as important as what you do. I am proud that Newsweek recently named HP, America's Most Responsible Company. Honors like this reflect our team's ability to deliver for shareholders today while paving the way towards a brighter future. Steven Fieler : My message today is about our confidence in the future. HP delivers on its commitments. We plan to deliver significant earnings per share growth driven by increased operating profit in Personal Systems and Print, structural cost reductions and ongoing productivity, combined with the right investments for our future, strong free cash flow and an optimized balance sheet. HP's operational strategy and financial plans are based on realistic market assumptions, proven execution and leadership across our portfolio, cost reduction opportunities that are already being executed and growth businesses that already exists. We see significant operational upside ahead. Over the last 3 years, HP has returned $9.1 billion or 80% of free cash flow to shareholders. Looking forward, our strong balance sheet and robust free cash flow generation provide us with multiple levers for value creation. We are highly confident in our ability to continue delivering on our commitments. Charles Victor Bergh : As Chairman of the Board of HP and an Independent Director, my responsibility is to ensure the right decisions are being made to drive long-term value creation. The Board and I take this very seriously, and I am proud of what HP has accomplished in this regard since the time of the separation. This is one of the world's most iconic and most trusted brands with a highly differentiated technology and intellectual property, huge global scale and reach and incredible talent at all levels of the organization. HP is building from a position of great strength. Our multiyear plan includes 3-year financial targets, reflecting our unwavering commitment to shareholders. To execute this plan, HP has a highly experienced management team. Enrique is the right leader to drive HP forward. The Board and I are united behind him as CEO. HP's Board is comprised of world-class directors with a diverse set of skills and expertise needed for a global technology leader, including in the areas of disruptive innovation, sound corporate governance, value-creating M&A, disciplined capital allocation and prudent cost management. The Board and I are very confident in HP's future. HP shareholders can count on us to continue delivering on our commitments to create value. Alex Cho : In Personal Systems, we are creating amazing new experiences for customers while driving profitable growth. Personal Systems is a large and growing business that has further expansion opportunity with the next generation of customers and exciting new compute models. We have a winning strategy that's anchored in premium design, security and innovation to continue gaining share in higher value categories. That's exactly what we've done in the past 3 years, and we are still under-indexed in these higher-margin categories. So we have room to grow. We expect to grow Personal Systems revenue at or better than the market while expanding operating margins to 3.5% to 5.5%. This is a great time to be in Personal Systems. We are creating the compute experiences of the future. Tuan Tran : We have an incredible Print business. We are the leader in size, scale, profit and innovation in office, home and graphics printing. And yet, we're still under-indexed in attractive categories like contractual office printing, where we've led the industry consolidation. In 2017, we acquired Samsung's Printing business. Having personally spent a year in Korea leading the integration, we were able to demonstrate cost takeout while driving incremental revenue opportunities. We're executing a strategy that will continue to advance our leadership, better deliver customer experiences and improve our profitability. As a result, we're increasing our long-term operating margin target for print to 16% to 18%. We will continue to be the most innovative printing company in the world, bar none.  Graphics and 3D printing play an important role in our long-term plans. HP's decades of investment in innovation have created a leading portfolio of technology and intellectual property, and we're monetizing this portfolio to extend beyond the hardware by building a complete solutions ecosystem that unlocks new sources of value across key industrial markets. We believe in the power of print, and we will continue to lead the industry forward. Christoph Schell : Our customers in 250,000 channel partners worldwide are at the center of everything we do. I talk with them every single day, and I can tell you, there's an incredible excitement about HP's future. Our new commercial organization places us closer to our customers and partners than ever before. We are driving operational efficiency through a consistent go-to-market strategy with globally standardized tools and processes, enabling a consistent execution of the 4 Ps of marketing. This consistency has contributed to the significant cost savings we are generating worldwide and has enabled us to become a simpler, faster and more agile company poised to build on our success and accelerate our momentum. We are delivering more and more personalized services and solutions to meet changing customer needs. It is what we call the Segment of One. This requires us to harness new technologies to become a more data-driven company, which both enhances the customer experience and reduces our costs. Our customers and partners like where we are heading. We are reimagining what's possible, and we are enabling the outcomes that they need to be successful in the future. Enrique Lores : Our results reflect the kind of company we have built, laser focused on execution and delivering value to our shareholders over the short and the long term. And our 3-year financial plan shows that we don't plan to slow down any time soon. Thank you for your support of HP. We are writing a new chapter in the story of this great company. And I know it will be our best one yet.",

Enrique Lores : Thank you, Beth, and thank you, everyone, for joining. Let me first say that I hope you and your families are healthy and safe. Our thoughts are with all of those affected by this global pandemic. I especially want to thank all the frontline workers who are showing incredible courage. I speak for all of HP when I say we are grateful for all they are doing. The world has dramatically changed since our call in February, and we have a lot to cover today. I will start with a brief update on how HP is responding to COVID-19. I will then discuss the near-term impact from the pandemic and our Q2 performance. And I will provide updates on our strategy and our previously announced value plan. Steve will then take you through the details of the quarter and provide updates on our balance sheet, liquidity and outlook before we open the lines for Q&A. So let me start with our response to the pandemic. We like to say that tough times are when HP's culture shines brightest, and that's exactly what we have seen in recent months. I am proud of the way our teams have stepped up to support our partners, customers and communities. Our top priority has been and will remain the health and safety of our employees. From the start, we quickly pivoted the vast majority of our people to work from home. For those in manufacturing, another critical function that cannot work remotely, we implemented social distancing along with additional safety and cleaning protocols. And as significantly, we have taken meaningful actions to remain close to our customers and partners. Specifically, we have implemented a variety of relief initiatives to help them navigate their operational and financial challenges. We believe this investment will further strengthen our relationships and support our value-creation strategy over the long term. But a crisis of this magnitude demand that we do more than simply protect our business. We must also protect the communities we serve. Our teams took immediate actions to deploy our technology and resources to address a range of urgent needs. I will share just a few examples. HP and our partners have now produced roughly 2.3 million 3D-printed parts for face shields, respirators and other items for distribution to hospitals. And we are now ramping up production of 3D-printed nasal swabs with partners to help in the effort for mass testing. Because up to 60% of people currently working from home are using personal machines, we made Sure Click security software freely available through September to protect against cyber threat. And with almost 90% of the world's students out of school, HP and HP Foundation are donating millions of dollars in technology and grants to enable remote learning. As all our teams have adapted to new routines, I am proud of the way they kept the needs of our customers and our communities front and center. Turning to our results. There is no doubt that COVID-19 is impacting our business. While some areas performed very well as people shifted to work from home, others suffered and we faced supply chain disruptions. Despite these challenges, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.51. Revenue was $12.5 billion, down 11%, driven by macroeconomic and supply chain challenges associated with the pandemic. Let me provide some context on the impacts we are seeing on both the supply and demand side as well as the actions we are taking to mitigate risks. I will start with supply. Both print and Personal Systems experienced manufacturing and supply chain disruptions during the quarter. As we noted on our February call, manufacturing in China remained shut down after Chinese New Year before beginning to ramp in late February. Starting in late March, we also experienced disruptions to operations in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world as the pandemic spread. We took swift action to adjust to this development, and our manufacturing capabilities were largely back to full capacity by early May. We will continue to monitor the situation for any other potential disruptions. Moving forward, we are evaluating plans to improve the resiliency of our supply chain, including increasing our levels of own inventory to help mitigate the risk of future outbreak. On the demand side, there is no question that the lockdowns around the world have created new and different demand dynamics in the market. This presents both tailwinds and headwinds across our portfolio, and I want to walk you through what we are seeing. As people work from home, operate their businesses remotely and complete the school year online, we are playing an even bigger role in their everyday life. The current environment will have a lasting impact on the way we live and work, and it will further increase the importance of technology. For our business, this presents some attractive near- and long-term opportunities as well as some challenges that we will talk about. In Personal Systems, we saw increased demand as organizations of all types and sizes focus on keeping people connected, productive and secure. This strong demand, combined with a constrained supply, resulted in an elevated backlog, which we expect to work down during Q3. Customers all around the world have been reminded of the essential role that PC play, and we are taking action to capitalize on these opportunities. During the pandemic, we have introduced some incredible innovation aligned to customer insight. For example, companies need to rapidly and securely deploy new devices to workers who are either at home or on the front lines. To meet this need, we launched new enterprise Chromebooks and Mobile Thin Clients. We also launched a new range of ZBook by HP mobile workstations and Envy notebook that empower creators. And just this week, we introduced the next generation of Elite PC and ergonomic monitors. We also launched dedicated services to improve employee experiences and help workers connect to the cloud and collaborate with colleagues. And with people spending more time at home, the PC also continues to emerge as a hub of entertainment. Gaming is the best example. And earlier this month, we launched a new lineup of OMEN PCs and displays. In Printing, we are facing near-term challenges driven by both supply and demand issues. In commercial print, including office and graphics, we saw a significant slowdown in late March as offices closed and large events and trade shows were canceled. While we believe that office and graphics usage will rebound once businesses fully reopen, we expect that Q3 will be similar to April. And thus, we expect that our financial results will be more negatively impacted in Q3 than Q2. In consumer, we saw increased demand for hardware and ink supply as countries went into lockdown and customers set up home office and school environment. However, we were not able to fulfill all of the orders given the manufacturing disruptions. On the positive side, we also saw a surge in Instant Ink and now have more than 7 million subscribers accelerating the shift to services that we have been driving. HP's leadership across both consumer and commercial premium market makes us uniquely well positioned to weather the near-term challenges and emerge from the crisis stronger than the competition. Let me now move to our go-forward strategy and value creation plan. We are continuing to execute the strategy that we outlined at our security analyst meeting last year, and we remain confident that it will deliver significant value over the long term. As a reminder, our strategy is focused on 3 key priorities : advancing our leadership in Personal Systems and print; disrupting industries with our technology and intellectual property; and transforming the way we work across HP to get closer to customers and reduce our cost. We continue to make progress against our plan, and we are rapidly adapting to the new realities of the current environment. In Personal Systems, we are advancing our leadership with a continued focus on high-value categories and cost efficiency. As the PC plays a more integral role in people's lives, we see attractive opportunities to innovate with new hardware, services and solutions, including security and sustainability. In print, we are evolving our business model with greater focus on driving more balanced system profitability over time while also taking significant costs out. We see the opportunity to accelerate the shift towards services. For example, we believe in Instant Ink momentum and the broader shift to contractual will continue as work remains more mobile and location-agnostic even when the pandemic fades. In addition, our diverse portfolio across consumer and commercial affords a unique opportunity in the changing landscape. We also remain focused on disrupting industries where our innovation and IP give us sustainable competitive advantages. While some of these businesses in graphics and 3D have been halted by the economic slowdown, we believe they will recover post COVID and they'll remain significant long-term opportunities for our business. Supply chain flexibility and resilience will be a priority topic for all companies going forward, and we expect digital manufacturing will be an important part of these discussions. This pandemic has shown the benefits of 3D printing, specifically speed, agility and localized production. This has led to deeper, more strategic engagement with customers as they evaluate their supply chain and consider more distributed manufacturing model. As an example, in April, one of our customers, SmileDirect, quickly pivoted during the pandemic from making dental aligners to producing personal protective equipment. To deliver on our priority, we are executing our transformation program to become a leaner, more digitally enabled company, and the current crisis will actually help accelerate several initiatives. We are making significant progress in these efforts. Through the first half of the year, we are tracking ahead of our first year target to generate 40% of the total $1.2 billion in gross, annualized run rate structural cost savings. We are also taking additional actions to mitigate the short-term headwinds from COVID-19. These start at the top with temporary reductions in executive and Board compensation. We're also restricting external hiring and making further short-term reductions in discretionary spending. As we navigate the current environment, we remain committed to the principles of the value plan we outlined in February. This includes the multiple levers we have to drive profitability, our revised leverage targets, and our disciplined approach to capital allocation, including returning significant capital to shareholders unless higher ROI opportunities emerge. As it relates to the value plan targets, we are committed to the long-term goals we have set. However, given the extraordinary and highly dynamic environment in which we are currently operating, the timing to achieve these goals may change. When we have greater visibility on the macro environment, we will be in a better position to provide a long-term financial update. We believe this is the most prudent approach as we act in the best interest of our shareholders and all the stakeholders. Before I turn the call over to Steve, I want to provide some closing thoughts. HP has always been fueled by innovation, collaboration and a purpose-driven culture. These are core strengths of our company that position us well in our market and drive our optimism about the future. And although there are challenges right now due to COVID-19, we never lose sight of the big picture. It is clear that the pandemic shot can also be a catalyst for change at the intersection of the digital and physical world from the increasing relevance of PCs in people's lives to the growing interest in 3D and digital manufacturing and the importance of playing across consumer and commercial printing. We continue to see significant opportunity for HP to drive long-term value creation. And we believe our structural advantages, disciplined cost management and then we're very focused on the customer position us well to navigate the current headwinds while capitalizing on new opportunities across our business. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve to take you through the financial details. Steven Fieler : Thanks, Enrique. As Enrique described, we've experienced significant changes since our last earnings call. This is creating both challenges and opportunities across our businesses and geographies. Importantly, as we have seen over history, we believe the strong can become stronger in the years ahead, and therefore, we are not standing still. This requires leadership and agility coupled with strong execution and leveraging HP's foundational strengths, including our geographic breadth and scale, portfolio and customer segment diversity from the office through the home as well as our balance sheet and strong liquidity position. We have multiple levers of value creation in the company both in the short term and long term to adapt and manage the ups and downs in our business. Now let's look at the details of the second quarter. Net revenue was $12.5 billion, down 11% year-on-year or down 10% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, EMEA declined 7%, Americas declined 10% and APJ declined 16%. Gross margin was 20%, up 60 basis points year-on-year driven primarily by disciplined execution and improved rate in Personal Systems. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.6 billion, down $136 million sequentially and $138 million year-over-year. We are seeing tangible structural cost savings achieved through our transformation program as well as the benefits of additional temporary discretionary cost actions taken in response to current economic headwinds. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $57 million for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.51 with a diluted share count of approximately 1.4 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net benefit totaling $23 million related to nonoperating retirement-related credits and other tax adjustments, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets and restructuring and other charges. As a result, Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.53. Before I get into the details by business, let me expand on Enrique's remarks regarding the supply chain impacts. I'll cover 3 points. First, as expected, we experienced manufacturing disruption early in the quarter due to the China factory closures. This impacted both Personal Systems and print. This created a back-end-loaded supply quarter and a higher Personal Systems backlog entering Q3. For reference, we recorded roughly 50% of our PS revenue in month 3, which is historically high. Second, later in the quarter, we began to see manufacturing disruption in Southeast Asia, which directly impacted our print business, both hardware and supplies, and we are monitoring any impact to PS component suppliers. Our print manufacturing capacity returned to normalized levels in early May, so the supply disruption should primarily impact the first part of Q3. Third, logistics were challenging. We have certain challenges delivering to our end customers and countries with full lockdown, such as India. And in general, our logistics costs were elevated. Altogether, Q2 was a complicated supply chain quarter, but our teams are highly experienced to manage through short-term disruptions. Turning to segment performance. In Personal Systems, we are proving that the PC is essential. We are pleased with the profit growth of this business despite factory supply constraints that pressured our top line during the quarter. The business benefited from strong demand related to working and learning from home, particularly in notebooks. Revenue was $8.3 billion, down 7% or 6% in constant currency. Drilling into the details. By customer segment, both commercial and consumer revenue were down 7%. By product category, revenue was flat for notebooks, down 18% for desktops and down 23% for workstations. Personal Systems has been consistently delivering profit growth and improved mix over time. Year-over-year commodity favorability, which was partially offset by higher logistics costs, drove another quarter of exceptionally strong profitability. Operating margins remained high at 6.6%, and operating profit dollars were up 43% year-on-year to $552 million. Personal Systems OP represented 50% of HP's profit mix for the quarter. We remain confident in our long-term operating margin target of 3.5% to 5.5%. In print, we remain uniquely well positioned in the market by being leaders across both consumer and commercial print. However, we are facing near-term challenges driven by both supply and demand issues. Starting with Q2 demand, we saw a decrease in commercial print across our office and graphics businesses, especially in March and April. This includes a negative impact to both hardware and supplies as businesses have temporarily closed and office workers transitioned to working from home. Let me illustrate this with some additional detail that we don't typically provide. In Managed Print Services, we saw a roughly 40% monthly decline in pages from February to April. And in graphics, Indigo impressions went from being up 9% year-over-year in February to down 24% year-on-year in April. On the other hand, in an environment where much of the globe has moved to work from home, we saw an increase in overall demand for consumer inkjet during the quarter. Looking at the details. Q2 total print revenue was $4.2 billion, down 19% nominally and 18% in constant currency. Print operating margins were 13.2%, down 280 basis points sequentially, driven by lower hardware and supplies volume especially in commercial print and a negative impact from supply chain disruptions and higher logistics costs. That said, despite our Q2 results, we remain confident in our long-term operating margin target of 16% to 18% once workers return to the office and demand improves. By customer segment, commercial hardware revenue was down 31%, and consumer hardware revenue was down 16%. Total hardware units were down 23%, with commercial units down 25% and consumer units down 22%. Second quarter supplies revenue was $2.8 billion, down 15% in constant currency. And office and graphics printing were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 lockdown orders in the last 1.5 months of the quarter. In Q3 and until workers return to the office and businesses reopen, we expect supplies revenue to be more pressured than Q2. Overall, in Q2, the team remained disciplined in managing channel inventory, keeping Tier 1 channel inventory levels below the ceiling despite the sudden demand declines in the commercial space. Let me now turn to our transformation efforts and specifically our cost savings actions and opportunities ahead. A few points : First, we are making good progress on our announced plans and currently tracking ahead of the 40% first year target we set last quarter as part of our 3-year $1.2 billion gross run rate cost-reduction plan. Second, we plan to accelerate cost reductions as much as possible and look for new opportunities, including real estate. Third, we're taking prudent steps to reduce discretionary cost as much as possible. While these are more temporary than structural benefits, we believe it's the right thing to do in this environment. Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Q2 cash flow from operations and free cash flow were a negative $0.5 billion and a negative $0.6 billion, respectively. As I signaled last quarter, cash flow was negatively impacted due to the delayed manufacturing timing and back-end-loaded quarter in our business. That said, HP's businesses are strong cash flow generators over multiple periods, and we maintain a strong balance sheet to meet liquidity needs. In Q2, the cash conversion cycle was minus 34 days. Timing of procurement and production drove higher AP, inventory and other assets and liabilities. Accounts receivable increased both due to revenue linearity and also because of the payment extensions we're providing in specific cases to help customers and partners weather the crisis. We've returned $123 million to shareholders through share repurchases and $252 million via cash dividends in Q2. Our share buybacks were limited in the quarter due to the Xerox situation and closed repurchase windows. As Enrique stated, the principles of our value plan remain in place. This includes how we manage our balance sheet, including the importance of investment-grade credit rating and our 1.5 to 2x gross debt leverage target. In the near term, we will be prudent to focus on managing through changing dynamics in our business operations as our top priority. Therefore, we expect to be at the lower end of our debt-to-EBITDA range and to hold higher cash on the balance sheet. Our return of capital principles also remain intact, including our commitment to a robust dividend and share repurchase program. In the near term, we expect to be active in the market and return greater than 100% of our free cash flow in FY '20. Beyond FY '20, we remain committed to returning 100% of free cash flow. In addition, consistent with our previously announced strategy, we intend to pursue a significant enhanced share repurchase program although the specifics will be determined once market conditions stabilize. We will update you in Q3 on how these plans progress. Looking ahead, we would like to make the following comments starting with FY '20. Since the COVID-19 crisis started, we've been stress testing our model and running a number of scenarios based on a range of assumptions. For FY '20, given the level of uncertainty around the duration of the pandemic, the timing and pace of economic recovery and the potential impact of a resurgence in cases, there's a much wider range of outcomes for the year. As a result, we will not be providing an outlook for full year 2020. That being said, we expect our business to generate positive cash flow for the second half of the year. For Q3, we are factoring in our best assumptions at this time, recognizing the situation remains highly dynamic. Specific to Personal Systems assumptions, we expect strong demand given the elevated backlog and surge from working and learning from home. We will closely monitor supply constraints, whether it be CPU or from other select commodity suppliers. And we expect the overall cost from the basket of components and logistics to be higher than we saw in the second quarter. In Printing, we expect Q3 to be more challenging than Q2 from a demand perspective until office buildings and businesses reopen. This will impact hardware and supplies, especially in commercial print. We expect continued positive demand for printing at home, but supply challenges from Southeast Asia will be constraining consumer print early in the quarter across hardware and supplies. As a result, we expect print revenue and margins to be lower in Q3 than Q2, with improvements beginning in Q4 following offices reopening. Taking all of these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook : We expect Q3 '20 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.39 to $0.45 and Q3 '20 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.41. In closing, our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity provide a solid foundation to manage through this uncertain environment while also providing capacity to capitalize on emerging opportunities, which we expect to arise out of this disruption. We will continue to take the necessary actions to manage through the near-term challenges while remaining focused on executing our strategy to drive long-term value creation. And now I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Huberty : Enrique, when you rolled out the shift in printer strategy back in October, you said that you would take in market feedback, which may cause you to either slow or accelerate the rollout of that strategy and the geographic expansion. How has COVID impacted the pace at which you look to shift the Printing strategy particularly given there is some discussion around more of a structural shift away from the office and towards working in the home? And then I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Sure. Thank you, Katy. So actually, what we have learned in the last week has been very encouraging in terms of the changes or the evolution of the business model that we were driving in print. As we mentioned during the prepared remarks, we have seen a significant increase in adoption of subscriptions, which is a key part of the evolution. And this means that really supports the rest of the changes that we are going to be driving. As we announced almost a year now or 9 months ago, we will be launching the first products with a new model this fall and we are on track to make that happen. And as we said in February, the feedback we are getting from customers has been very positive, and we have been sharing that now with a significant number of retailers all over the world. Steven Fieler : And just to add to that from a contractual perspective, what we've started to hear from customers is because HP plays so prevalently in both the home and office -- and that's not just from a product perspective but that's from a services perspective, it's from a delivery perspective of how we can uniquely leverage our Managed Print Services offering with our Instant Ink offering to provide that sort of seamless transition from the home to the office with customers' employee base. Enrique Lores : Yes. That's a very important comment. We have been having lots of conversations lately with customers on what do they need to do to enable their employees to work from home. They ask for PC, they ask for accessories, and they ask for the ability to be able to -- for their employees to print, and this is a unique advantage that we have. Kathryn Huberty : Interesting. Steve, just as a follow-up, can you talk about what the makeup of inventory looked like at the end of the quarter, sort of PCs versus printers and component inventory versus finished goods? Which of those categories drove the increase? And then when should we expect to see inventory fall materially? Steven Fieler : Yes. I mean our inventory both in terms of dollars as well as days obviously peaked here in Q2, coming from a lower base in Q1. It was driven heavily by the build in the Personal Systems space. That was really 2 factors. The largest factor was, as expected, the back-end-loaded linearity of the quarter. With the China factory shutdown early in the quarter as we headed to the back half, it just, by math, sort of creates a higher inventory in the back half of the quarter as well as all the in-transit. We did pursue some level of strategic buying on the Personal Systems side also in the quarter to set ourselves up for the second half. Looking forward, I would say that we are anticipating some level of higher inventory than what we traditionally held not to the levels that we are at today. And that's really more of a function of, in the short term, pursuing some resiliency particularly around ink or other products that we want to hold a higher balance with. We also did a pretty effective job around channel inventory and I said that broadly across hardware and supplies. While there's pockets clearly where we had to slow sell-in in the quarter as we reflect in our channel inventory levels, broadly speaking, we remain with a lot of discipline throughout the quarter on CI. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I guess first off, Enrique or Steve, I just want to go back to the capital allocation discussion. If I got this correctly, the commitment is to return over 100% of free cash flow for this year and then 100% for fiscal '21, but you're going to pause on the outsized buyback program that was part of that $16 billion capital return program. I want to make sure I got that right. And what makes you un-pause this? What are the guideposts? What are you going to look for to go back to that outsized buyback program you talked about 90 days ago? Steven Fieler : Why don't I take that and I'll repeat a little bit and maybe add maybe a bit more context or color to the prepared remarks. But I think at the macro level, the principles of the value plan remain in place, and that includes how we manage the balance sheet, our target leverage, the 1.5 to 2x, the importance of investment-grade credit rating. Also, over time, we do see the opportunity to lower the cash on hand. That being said, in the short term, we think having a higher cash balance is prudent to ensure we can work through any economic cycle. We also see from a principal perspective the opportunity to drive free cash flow into the future, and we believe we're undervalued. So I take all of those in consideration. And then specifically in this current COVID-19 situation, there is just a high level of uncertainty. And we believe being prudent with our approach is the most important thing and therefore expect to be operating at the lower end of our leverage ratio and then get higher cash on hand. And navigating the business is our top priority. And then as it relates to the actual return of capital, once we get through the different economic impacts from the pandemic, we're going to update you on the specifics. In the meantime, we do plan to be active, returning at least 100% in this fiscal '20 year. For '21 and beyond, we remain committed to the 100% of free cash flow unless there's a better returns-based opportunity. But I think the fundamental point is when we outlined those principles of how we want to manage a balance sheet, how that would ultimately free up excess cash and how we see the use of that excess cash to return it to shareholders all remains, but we really need to manage through this current situation. And clearly, as we look at the months and quarters ahead, we'll be looking at our business in the market in general. There's things that are in our control, but more importantly, we're probably looking at things outside of our control at the pace of folks moving back into the office and other social and health indicators of making sure we're getting through the situation. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. That's really helpful. And if I could just follow up. You guys talked about, I think, elevated backlog on Personal Systems very specifically, but is there a way to think about how big was this backlog and how long does it take to clear up? And I assume this is all about Personal Systems and not supplies, but just any dimensions and time line to clear the backlog that you just talked about? Steven Fieler : So Amit, I'll go first. So I won't size the specific backlog. What I'll say -- I'll make a couple of points. So first being we've had, from a historical perspective, the several quarters of high backlog just given the CPU constraints. What I'd say in the current state, the backlog has been even higher than what we've seen in prior quarters. Moreover, just from a linearity perspective -- and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks but it's a really important statistic, and that is we had 50% of our revenue in Personal Systems achieved in month 3 in April. That's historically high levels. And so as we saw the quarter progress clearly in the first month and 2, we were constrained by supply even though the demand was there. And then month 3, with the supply started coming more robustly online, we have a demand to go fill, but it really created a very high backlog situation by the end of the quarter particularly in notebooks. Enrique Lores : And what is even more important is not only what is the operational situation, it is what is our confidence about the business, what we have learned during the last weeks are that PCs have become even more essential than they were before for people working from home, for students learning from home, from kids playing from home. And our confidence in the medium and long-term for the business has yet increased. And whether it's for PCs, for accessories, we clearly see a very strong opportunity in this category. Operator : Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. I just wanted to follow up on the PC commentary. So if you're seeing strong demand and you have backlog to fill, should we be expecting PC revenues to be up more than what they typically are in Q3 sequentially? So sequentially, you're typically up high single digits or double digits. I guess given all your commentary, that would suggest to me -- and given that you have a high level of inventory, that would suggest to me that you should be able to grow PCs on a sequential basis higher than that high single-digit seasonal pattern you typically see. Is that a fair interpretation? And if not, why? And I have a follow-up, please. Steven Fieler : So when we look at our Q3 expectations around Personal Systems, I won't specifically guide revenue. I will say that we do see the opportunity to grow above normal sequential. I think there's a lot of different periods, but I think if you look back in -- over multiple periods that we see the opportunity to provide upside on a normal sequential growth. That being said, we continue to monitor to make sure we've got the supply to fulfill all that demand. And while all the factories in general are -- have been back up and running, given that much of this demand is coming from notebooks and given the reliance on various component suppliers in the geographies in which they operate, it's important that we continue to monitor the situation. But from a demand perspective, we're definitely seeing demand to perform above normal sequential. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. And then I just wanted to follow up on the value creation plan. So I get the level of uncertainty. I think what you've been asked sort of 2 or 3 times in various forms this question. But let's say that this year is a tough year, obviously it's going to be a tough year, and you want to conserve cash. Let's say fiscal '21 goes back essentially to normal free cash flow generation levels, can we then assume that through fiscal '23, we should expect that you would buy back $13 billion worth of stock, which is what the announced plan, so the timing would get pushed out 1 year that you would buy back $13 billion worth of stock? And I guess the question would be why not. You announced this plan when the stock was at $23. It's now $16 and change, and so the proverbial expression of, if you liked it at $23, you must love it at $16 and change. So is that essentially what you're saying? Things are slowed down but you're committed to that magnitude over time. It's just going to be pushed out. So we should be thinking that order of magnitude, $13 billion through 2023, let's say, assuming the economy comes back to something close to normal in fiscal 2021. Steven Fieler : So this is how we're thinking about it. Again, the principles remain. And from a framework perspective, there's really 3 drivers, first of which is the leverage we take on. And while, in the current state, we expect to be at the lower end, certainly in a more steady state, we have comfort moving up in the range and taking on greater leverage and therefore bringing up cash. The second is our cash on hand, we finished with $4.1 billion of cash on hand. Again, in a steady state where we don't need to necessarily manage through such severe economic changes in the short term, we can lower the cash on hand, and that would also free up capital. And then the third is the free cash flow generation. And again, I guess to your question, as we begin to stabilize and the market begins to stabilize, we do have confidence in the multiple levers we have to drive cash flow. And as we get more visibility into that free cash flow projection, that clearly provides even further opportunity. We'll take all those into account to then determine the actual size and deployment of what the enhanced return of capital program could look like, but that's kind of how we're thinking about it. Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon Cross at Cross Research. Shannon Cross : I was curious what you've seen and heard from your customers recently as some of the countries in Europe have started to open up and then obviously some of the states, both on the Printing and the PC side, and if you've seen some improvement in terms of demand and flow-through. And I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Sure. We -- this is something that we are monitoring very, very closely, as you can imagine, Shannon. What we have seen, for example in China where the recovery started earlier, is a fairly steady recovery both of demand but especially of usage of printing from the office and also in graphics. 10 weeks after probably the worst week of the pandemic, we are still not at the levels where we used to be but we continue to see steady progress. We have also seen some improvement in some of the countries in Europe where the crisis started earlier. We have seen that in Italy, starting to see it in Spain, but are very, let's say, small moves. We think during the next weeks, we'll start seeing more activity. We will see a similar pattern to what we have seen happening in China. Shannon Cross : Okay. And then I kind of hate to ask this just because of what you went through with Xerox but I'm curious. The printing industry is obviously under both COVID as well as secular pressures in various places. How are you thinking about consolidation? I mean is this something that makes sense for you to be involved in? Or does it make more sense for share repurchase and perhaps looking at adjacencies or other areas where there's growth, like 3D printing? And I'm not indicating you're going to buy a 3D printing company but just in terms of technology. Enrique Lores : Sure. So at this point, Shannon, our focus is on executing our plan. This is where it was 8 weeks ago when -- before the crisis started, and it is even more important now given the overall environment. We had declared and we continue to believe that in the office space, consolidation is a value-creation activity. But really, we think that now, what we need to do is stay focused on our business and continue to drive it forward. We are also monitoring other M&A opportunity not only on the core businesses but also on the growth side that we think, because of the crisis, might be available to us. But again, our focus is on execution of our plan. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Paul Coster : You're obviously tremendously successful in branding the value creation plan, and so we want to talk about it and we're all getting our naming conventions right as well. But if I understand this correctly, it's the leverage that is the compromise you've made in the context of what's going on here. It's not on the expense containment program and the severance and restructuring charges associated with that. Or am I wrong? Steven Fieler : Yes. I mean if we sort of break down the various components of the value plan, there's the sort of return of capital, which I think we've discussed already on the call. And yes, that, to a large extent, is on managing through this situation with the right level of leveraging and cash on hand. As it relates to the other components of the value plan and specifically on our ability to drive operating profit dollars and free cash flow into the future, one of the primary mechanisms was the flow-through associated with our transformation program. And that transformation program called out for a $1.2 billion gross cost savings in FY '22 with $650 million of it dropping to the bottom line. As we sit here today, we have high confidence in the restructuring and cost takeout program and the structural reductions. In fact, we will continue to look for more opportunities, such as real estate and other activities. So we do remain committed to that. We also will continue to explore other discretionary cost takeouts. Certainly, in the current period, we have taken actions that Enrique highlighted across the company with certain salary reductions and such that we think is the right thing to do. And we're going to accelerate as much of that transformation earlier rather than later given we've got the opportunity to do so with the COVID-19 situation. So the short of it is, is we remain committed to the cost reductions that we have previously committed to. Enrique Lores : Let me emphasize this point because I think it's important. In terms of the financial goals of the value plan, we are -- we stay fully committed to those, both the profit that the businesses will create and also the flow-through that the transformation activities are going to create. There might be some timing impact given the current situation and given that 2020 is going to be a challenging year, but we see both upside, downside. It is, for us, too early to restate what is the timing of the plan, but we are fully committed to the financial goals that we shared and that we published in February. Paul Coster : And maybe this is a technical question. I understand that you do not intend to do the accelerated buyback using debt. But did you get authorization from the Board to proceed with that expanded buyback program? And have you the discretion to execute should circumstances magically improve all of a sudden? Steven Fieler : So as part of what we announced in February, we also announced that the Board did approve an authorization in total of $15 billion of share repurchase for the company. So there's plenty of authorization to pursue an enhanced repurchase program. Operator : Our final question today comes from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank. Kanghui Ong : Awesome. So I just have a question on the guidance. It seems like the guidance for the EPS at the midpoint is about 20% lower quarter-on-quarter. Now I kind of juxtaposed this against your revenue. July has -- at least in the last 4 or 5 years, has averaged about a 4% quarter-on-quarter growth. Kind of seasonally, July is better than April. So I'm just trying to understand, is the guidance for EPS conservative? Or do you expect revenue as well to be significantly below seasonal and perhaps even down significantly quarter-on-quarter? Steven Fieler : Yes. So why don't I kind of walk through some of the assumptions. I think maybe stating the obvious but it does remain a highly dynamic situation across both supply and demand. That's why we have a little broader range than we typically would for a quarter. That being said, I think it's important for us to be as transparent around the dynamics that we're seeing. And specific to Q3, the dynamics are different by segment and even different by categories within segments. So the assumptions are important. In Personal Systems, I already commented on the expectation for strong demand entering the quarter with high backlog. Therefore, we would expect to see positive sequential -- sort of above normal sequential growth as well as good year-over-year growth, assuming that we are supply-enabled. The overall basket of supply chain and logistics cost, we do anticipate to go up quarter-over-quarter driven by logistics costs. And then we're closely monitoring the shift in our unit mix and, in particular, the demand around notebooks and the work from home and learn from home, including the demand on the Chromebook side. For print -- and this is really the substance, I think, of the Q3 guide to your question. We are anticipating that commercial print will remain challenged across both the office and industrial businesses. And this is a market-wide comment. We saw the negative impact beginning in March and more definitively in April as offices closed. Unlike Personal Systems where we saw a very back-end-loaded quarter for print, we saw just a bit over 1/4 of the business in month 3 given the slowdown in demand and our discipline on pulling back on revenue on the commercial side. As a result, we do expect a larger impact in Q3 across both hardware and supplies. And that's really the driver. And beyond the COVID-19 situation, we do expect to continue taking cost out of the business. But when you add it all up, what we see today is between $0.39 to $0.45. Clearly, we're going to be driving the business based upon the respective dynamics that we see, including where we can get supply. But the largest driver of the sequential decline is really that we've got more months in quarter 3 to deal with from COVID-19 than we did in quarter 2. Enrique Lores : And the key thing is that we see this impact as temporary, yes. So you know we shared some of these data before. For example, in Managed Print Services, we saw a decline of pages printed of about 40% year-on-year. It's a significant decline as people were not in the office and there were not pages printed in the office. We saw a significant impact in graphics. We went from growing about 9% in Indigo pages in February to decline more than 20% in April. Again, these are temporary impacts. As economy will recover, we will go back to a more normal position. But when we look at the impact in Q3, as Steve just said, we expect 2.5 months, 3 months of bad performance in these categories versus about 1 month. Kanghui Ong : Got it. Appreciate that. And as a follow-up, just kind of the longer-term question, it seems like every quarter, my model, I just -- operating margins on Personal Systems side just keeps marching up. It's 6, 7 almost quarters, almost 2 years now that that's marched up and now above your range. And then conversely, print, I understand the latest quarter in particular is a little bit different but in general kind of a downward trend now that the mix is 50-50, right? And when, historically, Personal Systems is probably closer to maybe 1/3 if not 1/4 of the profit mix between the 2 segments, at what point do you think it's structural? Or do you think that at some point, you get back to that historical range, whereby Personal Systems is that 1/3 versus print, that 2/3 mix? Or do you think it takes a long time, it's going to happen in short order? Or do you think we're kind of seeing a new norm here? Steven Fieler : Well, I guess we don't manage our business to try to solve for a respective mix. I think we're very pleased with the results from our Personal Systems business, and it's sort of by the end math that represents half of the company's profit. But to your question, we have been driving very good margins both from a rate, but more importantly, we've been driving very strong operating profit dollar growth in that business and certainly see the opportunities to continue executing in the higher end of that long-term range, which bodes well for a category where the PC has become even more essential. On print, I would say that Q2 in our -- embedded in our outlook in Q3 are really temporary challenges in the print margin structure. We're dealing with larger supplies revenue declines driven by commercial as well as commercial hardware declines. But once the market begins to recover and workers go back to the office, we would anticipate that those margins would normalize back into that 16% to 18%. And then longer term, as we drive our strategy to drive more profitable customers, to drive a higher mix of contractual, to further penetrate the developing markets with our big tank offerings, these should be margin-accretive opportunities for us in addition to the cost takeouts that we're driving. Enrique Lores : Let me take now the opportunity to close the session. As always, thank you for joining and thank you for your questions. I wanted to end up by saying that we firmly believe that HP is very well positioned for the future. Most companies are facing challenges right now, but the best companies are those that have not simply weathered the storm, they are taking advantage of the opportunities that we see and transform their company. And this is exactly what HP is going to be doing. We have many strengths, a very strong balance sheet, a diverse portfolio, very disciplined cost management. And several of the trends that we have seen during the last week are going to help us to make our brand even more relevant, even more essential for our customers. Our focus stays in executing our plan and continue to drive value for our customers. Thank you, and stay safe. Operator : The conference has now concluded.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Beth Howe : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Fieler, HP's Chief Financial Officer.  Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available on our website shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and the accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at investor.hp.com.

Enrique Lores : Thank you, Beth, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. I truly hope you and your families are safe and well.  Our strong Q3 results in the face of unprecedented uncertainty reflect the agility of our team and the strength of our portfolio. Our people have done a tremendous job rapidly adapting to changing market conditions and driving disciplined execution and cost management. As a result, for the quarter, we delivered beyond our expectations on revenue, earnings and cash flow, and we repurchased $1 billion of shares, well ahead of prior levels. Importantly, we are navigating the environment well and capitalizing on new opportunity. We are positioning ourselves to meet the evolving needs of our customers from the essential role of the PC in an era of dispersed workforces and classrooms to the rise of subscription-based business models and more personalized solutions.  I consistently tell our team that times like these are when strong companies get stronger. This quarter results give me confidence in where we are headed. The strength of our strategy and operational capabilities will enable us to continue leading in both the print and PC categories. Today, I'd like to cover 3 topics with you : a summary on our third quarter performance; the progress we are making against our Advance/Disrupt/Transform strategy and our value plan; and finally, our current expectations for how the pandemic and other market dynamics will impact our business.  In Q3, we delivered revenue of $14.3 billion, flat year-on-year and up 16% quarter-on-quarter in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.49, and we generated free cash flow of $1.6 billion. Importantly, non-GAAP operating expenses were down over $0.25 billion driven by our ongoing cost reductions and lower discretionary spend. These are excellent results in the current environment. We continue to advance our leadership in Personal Systems and Print. In Personal Systems, we delivered growth in revenue, profit and share, and we delivered record unit shipments in Q3. The PC is more central to daily life than ever, and PC use is up more than 20% since COVID emerged. We are empowering remote workers and students with the ultimate office and learning experiences at home. This is fueled by a range of innovations that are keeping people connected, collaborative and secured. For example, in the quarter, we launched a broad new lineup of commercial EliteBooks and a new line of ergonomic monitors. Beyond work, nearly 2/3 of people say that PC is one of the main ways they stay entertained. And this quarter, we expanded our lineup of OMEN and Pavilion gaming PCs, displays and accessories.  Turning to Print. The business performed better than we expected. Unit performance improved sequentially, and we addressed the supply chain impact of the factory closures we discussed on the Q2 call. More broadly, we remain uniquely well positioned given our leadership across both consumer and commercial print, our strength that's a clear advantage in the current environment. The shift to remote work and learning drove an uptick in home printing. We saw an increase of ink usage versus our original target. And we saw strong growth in HP Smart App users, with mobile downloads up 70% year-over-year. We also launched a new lineup of HP ENVY printer with a family-centric feature set. We also continue to evolve our business model. We expanded our Instant Ink subscription business, growing subscribers double digits. We expect to surpass 8 million subscribers by the end of the fiscal year.  And we are connecting our Instant Ink and Managed Print Services systems to take advantage of the work-from-home trend. In Q3, we began rolling out the first phase of centralized billing for commercial employees printing from home. In the coming quarters, we will be expanding these offerings to enable frictionless print from anywhere for customers whose employees are not in the office full time. Importantly, in commercial printing, we did see some improvement as the quarter progressed. In Managed Print Services, July page volume was down roughly 25%, an improvement from April where we saw a decline of roughly 40%. While there remains much uncertainty about the phasing and pace of recovery, this is an early indication of office usage heading in the right direction. At the same time, we are making progress against our plans to disrupt industry with our technology solutions and IP. Across our industrial businesses, we continue to see attractive opportunities to drive medium- to long-term value creation. The benefits of 3D printing and the strength of our ecosystem have been clear throughout the pandemic. HP and its partners have produced more than 4 million 3D-printed parts for the health care sector. We also introduced a new 3D printing material and established an alliance with Oechsler, one of the industry's largest 3D parts manufacturers. While commercial business segments, such as graphics, have been challenged due to business closures, we did see attractive pockets of growth. Labels and packaging, for example, saw impressions increased 14% year-over-year.  Moving forward, we will continue to capitalize on opportunities to create value for HP and our customers by delivering new end-to-end applications that enable highly personalized products and solutions. And as we advance and disrupt, we are transforming the way we work. Our focus is to unlock value and become a leaner, more digitally enabled company. We are well ahead of our cost reduction plans for the year, and we are making progress against the many initiatives we outlined last fall. We have extended our geographic simplification initiative beyond our sales organization, the supply chain and customer support. And to adapt, our channel program to today's digital realities, we launched a new partner program called Amplify in Q3. The program will enable enhanced data analytics and provide partners with the capability, tools and insights required to capitalize on opportunities across the whole portfolio.  Overall, our Q3 results demonstrate the progress we are making against our strategy. Supporting this strategy is a set of financial principles that we outlined in our value creation plan. These principles include : the multiple levers we have to drive profitability, including our structural cost reduction program; our revised leverage target of 1.5 to 2x, maintaining an investment-grade credit rating; and our commitment to return to shareholders a 100% of free cash flow and excess cash over the long term, unless higher return on investment opportunities emerge. In the third quarter, we increased our share buyback, repurchasing approximately $1 billion in stocks. This is the highest level in a single quarter since separation. In the quarters ahead, we expect to maintain similar levels at a minimum. We remain fully committed to the principles of our value plan and are demonstrating concrete progress toward our goals.  This leads me to the next topic : the trends we see in our business. In the home and consumer segment, we expect continued strength through at least the end of the year. Even as countries reopen, people will continue to spend more time at home. The commercial market will likely remain dynamic. In commercial PC, we expect the accelerated mix shift from desktops to notebooks to continue driven by strength in Chromebooks, particularly in education. In office and commercial print, as I mentioned earlier, we have seen signs of improvement. We anticipate the reopening of businesses will gradually increase the demand for printing and related services. That said, the phasing and pace of the recovery remains dynamic.  I want to close on HP's culture. In tough times like this, it matters more than ever not only a high-performance culture that drives innovation as well as shareholder value but a purpose-driven culture that creates value for society and, most of all, a culture that unites employees with not only a shared purpose but also a commitment to doing what is right. In the face of a global pandemic and a long overdue reckoning with racial inequality, this has never been more important. And I am proud of the way our people and partners are stepping up and taking action to drive systemic change. During that time we saw much strife in the world, we have seen our employee engagement scores reach all-time highs. The HP culture is a source of strength that is guiding us forward. You will continue to see us take actions to drive a more sustainable, equitable and just future. It is not just the right thing to do, it is good for our shareholders. In 2019, our Sustainable Impact work helped drive more than $1.6 billion in new sales.  Our results this quarter, the commitment of our people and the strength of our culture give me confidence in where we are heading. While we have lots of work to do, we see significant opportunity to drive long-term value creation. Our structural advantages, disciplined cost management and unwavering focus on the customer position us well to navigate current headwinds. And our leadership in both consumer and commercial uniquely positions HP to capitalize on opportunities across the business.  With that, I will turn the call over to Steve to take you through the financial details. Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Enrique. We are pleased with our third quarter results, especially in light of our overall market and macro context. Our performance reflected the company's multiple profit levers, execution agility and resiliency.  Third quarter net revenue was $14.3 billion, down 2% year-on-year or flat in constant currency. As expected, we saw growth in Personal Systems revenue and declines in Print revenue. Regionally, in constant currency, APJ increased 5%, EMEA increased 2% and Americas declined 4%.  Gross margin was 16.7%, down 320 basis points year-on-year. The decline was due to a combination of a higher Personal Systems mix, a higher consumer mix within Personal Systems and a lower Print rate driven by volume.  Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.5 billion, down $274 million year-over-year. The OpEx decline is driven by our ongoing cost reductions program as part of our transformation efforts as well as a reduction in discretionary costs. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $42 million for the quarter.  We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.49 with a diluted share count of approximately 1.4 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net benefit totaling $32 million related to nonoperating retirement-related credits and other tax adjustments, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets, debt extinguishment costs and restructuring and other charges. As a result, Q3 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.52.  Turning to segment performance. In Personal Systems, we delivered another strong quarter, growing share, revenue and profit dollars. The business demonstrated its resiliency following the impact of COVID on supply chain issues in fiscal Q2. In Q3, Personal Systems benefited from strong demand related to working and learning from home with revenue of $10.4 billion, up 7% or 9% in constant currency.  Drilling into the details by customer segment. We saw differing results with consumer revenue up 42%, while commercial revenue was down 6%. By product category, again, the results differed. Revenue was up 30% for notebooks, down 29% for desktops and down 30% for workstations. The change in mix reflects the strong demand for notebooks, mainly in Chromebooks, from the educational and consumer markets, respectively, as the shift to working and learning from home continues.  Operating margins remained high at 5.5%. And operating profit dollars were up year-on-year to $570 million, representing 54% of HP's segment profitability. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of operating profit dollar increase as the team has effectively navigated headwinds and tailwinds during this time.  In Print, we had anticipated a challenging quarter given the COVID impact on our commercial business, and the team demonstrated agility and strong execution, meeting or exceeding our expectations. Importantly, HP remains uniquely well positioned in the Print market by being leaders across both the home and office with longer-term growth opportunities across our industrial categories. This creates opportunities in this current environment and beyond to address the changing and holistic customer needs by providing innovative, secure and strong ROI value propositions across geographies and customer segments.  Looking at Q3 demand, as we expected, we saw a decrease in commercial print across our office and graphics businesses. This includes a negative impact to both hardware and supplies as many businesses remain close and office workers continue to work from home in many geographies. On the other hand, in our home printing business, we continue to see strong demand coming from work from home. As a result, consumer hardware revenue grew 7% and units increased 3%, and commercial hardware revenue declined 37% and units declined 32%. Third quarter Supplies revenue was $2.6 billion, down 18% in constant currency as office and graphics printing were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 restrictions. Overall, in Q3, the team remained disciplined in managing channel inventory, keeping Tier 1 channel inventory levels below the ceiling.  In total, Q3 Print revenue was $3.9 billion, down 20% nominally and 19% in constant currency. And Print operating margins were 12.2%, which included a full quarter impact of office closures in commercial print and the corresponding volume declines. Operating profit dollars were $480 million.  In general, we saw improvement in commercial print usage through the course of the quarter as well as our factories back to more normalized levels. Therefore, we remain confident that Q4 operating profit dollars and margin rate will improve sequentially. And that as volumes increase, our operating margins will return to our long-term target of 16% to 18% over time.  Let me now turn to our transformation efforts and, specifically, our cost savings actions and opportunities ahead. Importantly, we're making good progress on our announced plans. We are currently tracking well ahead of plan in our 3-year program to achieve $1.2 billion in gross run rate structural cost reductions.  To illustrate, we've seen significant operating expense reductions throughout the year with Q3 non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue at 10.6%. As we continue to generate savings, we are, at the same time, focused on improving effectiveness and speed. As an example, we have seen a positive impact driven across our centralized commercial organization and corresponding supply chain teams where, in recent quarters, we improved the speed and flexibility required to navigate the highly dynamic supply and demand changes across the globe. We are also making investments, especially in digital, which will help our overall customer, partner and employee experience in the quarters and years to come.  During this dynamic environment, we are continuing to reduce discretionary costs as much as possible. While these discretionary reductions can be more temporary than structural, we will continue to focus on driving a lean cost structure to help us navigate.  Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Q3 cash flow from operations and free cash flow were strong at $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, which helped strengthen our revised full year outlook. In Q3, the cash conversion cycle was minus 30 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle is down 4 days driven by more normalized purchasing and sales linearity, including decreases in days payable outstanding, days of inventory and days sales outstanding.  In Q3, HP raised $3 billion of senior unsecured notes. This is our first corporate debt raise since 2014 and is consistent with our capital structure strategy communicated earlier this year. The proceeds have many benefits, including creating capacity to make disciplined, returns-based capital allocation decisions, including share repurchases; moving our debt maturity curve, including retiring approximately $1.6 billion of 2020 and 2021 notes, along with short-term commercial paper; and in the near term, during this dynamic period, providing additional balance sheet prudence. These actions incorporate our commitment to an investment-grade rating.  Importantly, we are committed to a robust dividend and share repurchase program. We returned $953 million to shareholders through share repurchases and $251 million via cash dividends in Q3. For reference, these actions equate to buying back roughly 4% of HP shares in Q3 alone. Year-to-date, we have returned a total of $2.5 billion, which represents 121% of free cash flow. Looking forward, in the near term, we expect to continue being active in the market and buy back shares at elevated levels in the range of approximately $1 billion per quarter at minimum.  Heading into Q4, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook : we expect macroeconomic conditions to remain uncertain as we continue to monitor the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Turning to specific Personal Systems assumptions, we expect continued strong demand in consumer and education with more caution in commercial, particularly desktops and workstations. We expect industry-wide CPU and panel constraints to negatively impact our ability to meet demand, especially for notebooks, which will constrain top line growth. We expect the cost from the overall basket of commodities to be similar compared to Q3 levels. From a margin perspective, we would expect Q4 operating margins to be lower compared to Q3 driven by mix changes but still be in the upper half of our 3.5% to 5.5% long-term operating margin target range.  In Printing, we expect Q4 to improve relative to Q3. This includes units, total revenue, Supplies revenue, profit dollars and margin rate. We expect that our supply chain impacts mainly related to the earlier factory closures in Southeast Asia to be largely mitigated. From a demand perspective, we are still expecting commercial print to stay at depressed levels, with positive demand coming from home printing. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook. We expect Q4 '20 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.54 and Q4 '20 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.32 to $0.36. GAAP EPS includes the cost of restructuring, tax adjustments and onetime defined benefit plan settlement charges. We expect FY '20 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.16 and $2.20 and FY '20 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.83 to $1.87. We expect FY '20 free cash flow to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. And now I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Matt Cabral with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Matthew Cabral : I have 2 questions on PC. So I guess I'll just ask both at the same time. I guess the first one, I'm wondering if there's any way to break out how much of the growth you saw in the quarter was underlying strength versus just the backlog that carried over from April, and just any more incremental commentary about how to think about the demand picture from here. And then the second piece, you guys talked about Chromebooks a couple of times in the prepared remarks. Wonder if you could expand a little bit more on what you're seeing there, just how we should think about that relative to your mix and what that means relative to profitability of traditional PCs going forward? Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Matt, so why don't I take a stab at this. So first, as it relates to demand, I think where I started is we still see very strong demand, particularly in notebooks, driven heavily by Consumer and Chromebooks. We also saw strong demand in commercial notebooks in Q3, and that demand continues to remain strong. I think the way to think about it is this year has a slightly skewed seasonality just given the supply chain challenges we saw in Q2, which certainly helped the backlog entering Q3. We still have a strong backlog on the notebook side. But the way to think about it is our second half of the year should be historically stronger than our first half. Or maybe the other way to think about it is, if we look at our Q4 outlook, our Q4 forecast is roughly in line with what we see a typical Q4 being as a percentage of the total annual revenue mix. As it relates to sort of the margin profile, we are seeing much stronger demand, again, on Consumer and Chromebook, and that does have a slightly negative impact on our overall margin rate that is factored into our Q4 outlook as well. Enrique Lores : And maybe only one additional comment. As we look at the next quarter, really, the key limitation is not on the demand side, it's actually on the supply chain side, because given the demand that we see in some specific segments, we really need to find -- need continue to find more components, processors and panels to respond to the demand that we see. Operator : And our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan : Congrats on the strong whistle. The first question I had was on the Print business, do you think the business has broadened? Or do you think it's still tough to say given commercial is still depressed? And along the same path, are there any tangible milestones you can share as to how we can evaluate the subscription model on the Print business? And then I had a follow-up. Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer : Yes. As I said in my prepared remarks -- and really as expected or better than expected was our performance in Q3 and our outlook for Q4. And so we are expecting improvement sequentially in our total revenue and our Supplies revenue in the total units as well as in the margin dollars and margin rate from Q3 to Q4. So said more directly, yes, we view Q3 as the trough. Enrique Lores : And as we look at the recovery, the recovery is really very aligned to the evolution of the pandemic. We have seen the regions where -- that are performing better versus the pandemic, have stronger performance, APJ. The regions where still the pandemic is stronger are the ones that still the impact is bigger, like the Americas. Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer : And on the subscription side, to, I guess, finish my thought there, I think one of the key things that we keep on focusing on is Instant Ink subscribers. And we started off the year -- if I reflect on SAM last year, just about a year ago, we were roughly in the 5 million subscribers. We're now over 7 million, would expect 8 million by the end of this fiscal year, which is, I think, a strong indicator of the shift to subscription model. Operator : And our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : I was hoping you could just elaborate or clarify a little bit more on capital return. So it sounds like you're saying you're going to look to buy back at least $1 billion in shares per quarter. Add your dividend onto that, that's about $1.2 billion in capital return per quarter, $5 billion a year. Your cash flow generation is $3 billion per year. So should we expect this for the next several quarters, meaning 3 to 5 more quarters? Or are you only commenting on fiscal Q4? And when we think about you have net debt right now of $1.4 billion, where are you comfortable, in absolute terms, taking that debt? And will you be looking to raise additional debt to facilitate this buyback? And I have a follow-up, please. Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer : Yes. So from a return of capital perspective, the principles we outlined at the value plan are clearly in place. That does include the significant return of capital. We do continue to believe our stock is undervalued. We are demonstrating our ability to generate strong free cash flow. This year, the outlook is $2.5 billion to $3 billion. I would say, historically, we've been at the $3.5 billion north level. I won't comment on future years at this point, but I think what you're seeing is the agility in our portfolio and ability to manage, it's a strong free cash flow generating set of businesses. That ultimately gets to where we are today. And we are kind of, at the same time, recognizing it's a dynamic economic environment. So we're taking all those factors in considerations.  And we plan to be active in the market and buy back at elevated levels. It's at the approximately $1 billion per quarter at minimum, and we see that over the next few quarters. Clearly, if things change in the economic environment, we can update you on any change to the return of capital plans from there. In terms of sort of source of capital and your question around net debt, we do have comfort over time of having a higher net debt level and specifically even higher gross debt. And at the appropriate time, we have the opportunity to potentially access the debt markets again. We are still slightly below our leverage target of 1.5 to 2x, and so I think we just need to monitor the situation. And again, at the appropriate time, we do have comfort of going out and accessing more debt. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. And I was wondering if you could just comment on the dynamics in terms of how you're thinking of sequential growth. So Q3 to Q4, you're typically up, as a company, about 5% sequentially. Now you could say if you're coming out of an economic recovery, particularly in printing, we should expect your revenue growth to be above that. You did seem to suggest, though, that perhaps there could be -- could have been some backlog benefit this quarter and could be some supply constraints next quarter. So when we're thinking about the puts and takes relative to normal sequential growth for both imaging and printing for Q3 to Q4, should we be thinking about something that is seasonally in line for each of those businesses? And particularly for printing, why wouldn't we expect it to be better than that given you're calling for a gradual recovery in folks coming back to work, et cetera? So if you could comment on each of them and the forces that work on sequential growth relative to normal seasonality, that would be helpful. Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer : Yes. And I think you're right to bifurcate between the 2 segments. And on the Print side, we are expecting above normal sort of historical sequential growth driven by the fact that we did see a stronger month 3 on the commercial side from a usage perspective than we saw exiting last quarter, and we're continuing to see strength on the consumer side. And while there's still some small lingering kind of ripple effects from the supply chain, the factories, again, are generally at normalized levels. So that gives us confidence in an above normal sequential growth on the Print side. On the PC side, we're expecting a below normal sequential growth. And that is driven by the 2 factors, I think, that we respond to in the first question. The first one being we saw sort of the skewed seasonal patterns between Q2 and Q3 and, therefore, have a much higher Q3 base that we would grow from into Q4. And then the second factor is it really starts with the demand, but we're seeing such strong demand on consumer notebooks. In Chromebooks in particular, we are supply constrained. And that does impact our growth in Q4. And therefore, again, we would see below normal sequential growth. You put those 2 together at the company level given Personal Systems was 72% of our revenue this past quarter that, at a company level, we would anticipate that Q3 to Q4 would have a below normal sequential growth at the company level. Operator : And our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Huberty : Can you give us some more color around the page volume recovery that you're seeing in countries that have reopened or further in the reopening? And then how does that translate to a view around what the printer supplies decline will look like in the fourth quarter? And then I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Sure. Let me start with our global number, and then I will give more color per region. At the global level, as we shared last quarter, in April, we saw a decline on Managed Print Services pages, which is a good proxy, of minus 40%. We have exited July in a minus 25% range. So through the quarter, we have seen significant improvement. We have seen a constant trend. And this is really correlated to the situation versus the pandemic. In many Asian countries where the situation is much more under control, we see volumes close to where they were before the crisis. In the U.S. and in some of the Americas countries where the impact of the virus is still the strongest, they are still behind -- significantly more behind that number. And Europe is someplace in the middle. In the countries where economic activity is almost back to normal, we see usage level not at their previous level but very close to that. And what I'm talking is really the impact on the commercial side. On the consumer side, in the other side, driven by people working from home, kids learning from home, usage levels are, in most cases, above our original projections. And this balance on consumer and commercial is what really helps us and gives us confidence in what will be the evolution of this business going forward because we can hedge on the consumer side to really manage whatever impact we see on the commercial side. Kathryn Huberty : And then as a follow-up, just sticking with printing. In the context of the shift that you're seeing from commercial to consumer print hardware sales, what are you doing to improve the historical profitability of those consumer printer hardware placements as well as the NPV over the life of those printers? Enrique Lores : Sure. Actually, let me clarify something. When we look at the business from a system perspective, the consumer print business is more profitable for us than the commercial print business. Hardware printers are less -- have lower gross margins, but the total business has higher profitability. So this is one of the reasons why this potential rebalancing is actually could be even beneficial for us from a margin perspective. Second, in terms of what are we doing, we are executing the strategy that we shared a few quarters ago in really evolving and shifting or rebalancing the profit between supplies and hardware. And the comments Steve was making about the growth of our Instant Ink business is a clear example of how we are driving that forward. We have seen an acceleration of the deployment of Instant Ink. We think this is a critical part of our strategy. And on the other side, the introduction of the printers with the new business model, we are on track to start having some of these printers in the market by the end of the year. Operator : Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I have 2 as well. I guess, first off, Steve, I wanted to go back to the capital allocation discussion. How do we think about the duration of how long you will sustain this $1 billion buyback per quarter? And if I heard -- you guys talked about it, you said it's going to be at minimum $1 billion per quarter commitment going forward. If I recall, you guys have about a $14 billion authorization that's out there. So do I think of this momentum to sustain for the next 14 quarters quite literally? And then where does M&A fit into the narrative as well? Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer : Yes. So I'll comment on the return of capital, and maybe Enrique, you want to chime in on M&A. The comments, they really are, I would say, more in the quarters ahead. Clearly, as the economic situation stabilizes in the time frame ahead, we certainly can update our view on return of capital at that point in time. But as we see it today, the $1 billion at minimum -- and again, if I just reflect on Q3 just given where our stock price is, that represented roughly 4% of our shares outstanding. And so anywhere between 3% to 4% of our shares, ability to buy back with that $1 billion at minimum. And so I would say that's really for the quarters to come. Enrique Lores : Then let me complement that because what we are doing is we are taking a prudent approach. We acknowledge that the overall situation is still fluid, and we think it's important to stay with a high level of cash in the balance sheet to make sure we have optionality depending on how things evolve. But at the same time, given the strength of our progress, we think we can maintain these elevated levels of share buybacks for the next quarters until we see a better -- until we have better visibility of what the evolution of the overall environment will be.  Answering now the M&A question, I would say that we are going to remain very disciplined with our capital allocation process. We measure any action that we do on that front against a very rigorous return on capital process. And as we have shared before, any M&A activity we do will have to be aligned with the strategies that we have described. We'll have to have better ROI than other investments. And clearly, we believe that our shares are undervalued today. And third, we need to have a clear execution plan. This remains part of our strategy. But again, we will be applying that framework against any opportunity that we will consider. Amit Daryanani : Got it. That's really helpful. If I could just follow up quickly on the PC margin commentary for the October quarter, Steve, I think it sounds like it's going to drop down somewhat but be in the upper half of the range. Could you just talk about what are the reasons or what are the levers or headwinds you're having that margins are heading down? Because I get sales are sub-seasonal, but I assume they're still going to grow. So maybe just what other couple of headwinds you have on operating margin on PCs in October would be helpful. Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer : Yes. It's really just mix. And as we're seeing such a large demand in our consumer mix, and in particular, in Chromebook mix, it does have a slight downtick on our margin profile. I would say, over the long term, all of the actions and opportunities we have in mix remain : driving more displays, accessories, services in premium categories. But certainly, as we evaluate the demand and backlog that we see today, it is more heavily weighted to the notebook, consumer notebook, and that does have a downtick on our margin profile. So it's really mix. Operator : And our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : I would like to take a step back and think about the printing business. If we went back to a year ago, which seems like ages ago after everything we've all been through, but if you go back, how have the work-from-home, learn-from-home trends changed sort of your outlook on the subsidized, unsubsidized business model you announced where you might want to be investing in graphics, the A3 strategy? I'm just kind of curious as to how you've looked at what your assets were sort of pre-COVID and then how do you think you're going to be able to leverage them after COVID since you had announced such a sort of large strategy change that, obviously, Enrique, you just said, it's going to be rolling out starting at the end of this year. And then I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Yes. So the current situation is making that strategy even more important because as the consumer business becomes more relevant, and this is what has happened during the last quarter and we think will continue to happen during the next few quarters. Really, the importance of the shift into a model where we have profitability, better balance between hardware and supplies, becomes even more important. And also, as we shift into subscription models, our ability to maintain high share of HP original supplies is higher, which also makes that model evolution more important. So as we look at where do we see the business going? Clearly, winning in a stronger way in the consumer side is important for us. As I mentioned before, it has higher profitability. And actually, our share is higher. A higher number of pages printed in the office are being printed on HP printers with HP Supplies. So if pages shift to the home, it's a potentially positive trend for us.  And one of the elements that we have added to the strategy is the need to connect the printers in the office with the printers at home. What we are getting from many of our clients, and I think I shared that in the previous call, is that they want to enable their employees to be able to print from home in a secure way and with the companies paying for that. So what we are doing is connecting our Instant Ink service offering to the Managed Print Services offering. We had already some initiatives that we did during Q3, and we are building the infrastructure to do that in a seamless way during the next quarters. But really, what is behind that is really the ability to print anywhere in a secure way with companies paying and funding that for their employees. Shannon Cross : Okay. And with regard to the A3 strategy, any change there? Enrique Lores : At this point, there are no changes there. We continue to have low share in the office. But of course, if the overall office market is lower, eventually, we may end up shifting some of our core focus to the consumer side, if this is the final trend that we see. Operator : And our next question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : Two if I could, Enrique and Steve. Enrique, could you give us a sense of what your enterprise customers are saying sort of in general about their plans for coming back to the office. You've talked a little bit about that beginning and that's sort of shaking some demand loose but would love to get context there, and then also how you guys are thinking about small, medium business exposure as well. And then I have a quick follow-up. Enrique Lores : Sure. So what we are seeing in general is that many of the big customers are not going to be returning -- having their employees return to the office in the foreseeable future. We think this is a consistent trend across different countries. Though there are countries where the situation is better under control and, therefore, the number of employees is higher. And actually, it is very similar to what we are doing internally in the company. In many countries where situation is almost normal, we have our employees working back in the office. In other countries like the U.S. where the impact is still big, most of our employees are still working from home. So this is what we see really happening across the board with many of our large customers. Ananda Baruah : That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up, Steve, on the buyback, you did $56 million in this quarter. I think the blend -- sorry, the diluted was down just around $20 million. And so is that a matter of timing? Or was there some -- as the stock prices dropped, was there some dilutive impact to the -- dilution to the diluted shares? How should we think about that? And then also, do you have the ending share count for us as well, quarter ending share count? Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer : Yes. It's likely driven by timing in terms of sort of the accounting treatment on the fully diluted share count, it's dependent upon the timing in the quarter in which you repurchase those shares. We ended the quarter with 1.4 billion shares. We would definitely see that going down in the quarters to come given the larger and elevated levels of our buyback program. Operator : Our final question today will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : I just want to go back to kind of the supply chain and component cost dynamics. Could you help us appreciate or quantify the effect that you're seeing in the current business just last quarter and any kind of commentary you're expecting on that impact this quarter? And maybe a bit more succinctly, what kind of components are you seeing constraints on? Because I think we've seen kind of CPU constraints remain a headwind for quite some time, just curious of what exactly you're seeing there. Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer : Well, I think the -- sort of the question or issue starts with demand. And again, we are seeing strong demand in, particularly, categories of our Personal Systems business, i.e., notebooks and consumer notebooks, and Chromebooks in particular. That is creating outsized demand. And therefore, when we look at supply, the areas that we see constraints are in panels and in CPUs broadly to fulfill that demand. Aaron Rakers : And on the component cost environment, your -- I think some of the component cost dynamics are starting to turn maybe more deflationary. So I'm just curious if why maybe you might not be seeing some of that? Or are you just being conservative in your expectations the next couple of quarters? Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer : We are seeing in certain parts of the basket of overall commodities and components some deflationary trends. There are other parts that are more inflationary or stable. When we put them all together, including the cost of logistics, we are viewing Q4 to be roughly at similar levels as Q3, again, some up, some down, but overall, kind of flat sequentially. Enrique Lores : Well, let me close now with some final thoughts. First of all, I wanted to kind of emphasize the fact that we have leadership position in both consumer and commercial markets for both Personal Systems and Print. It's a source of strength for us going forward no matter how the current economic situation evolves. And we are really focused on capitalizing on the opportunities that we see ahead of us. The PC has become essential. And as we have discussed today, this is clearly an opportunity for us. But also the fact that we see growth in home printing and home subscription services are areas that are going to be helping our plans going forward. Having said that, we remain very focused on executing our strategy. We are executing what we said we were going to do a few quarters ago, and we are very confident in our ability to continue to create value going forward. Thank you for joining us today. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

And thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. It remains a difficult time for so many across the world. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy. Today, I will recap our strong Q4 and full year financial results, and I will discuss the significant progress against our Advance, Disrupt and Transform strategy. Let me start with the strength of Q4, where we drove improvement relative to the third quarter in revenue, operating profit, non-GAAP EPS and cash flow. We are encouraged by the signs of improvement in our business as we continue to navigate a dynamic macro environment. For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $15.3 billion, flat year-over-year in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.62, up 3% year-on-year. And we generated free cash flow of $1.8 billion.  For fiscal '20, despite the pandemic, we delivered on the full-year non-GAAP EPS and cash flow outlook we gave at our Analyst Day last year. For the full fiscal year, we delivered revenue of $56.6 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.28. In addition, we generated strong free cash flow of $3.9 billion, and we returned $4.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends while making appropriate investments in the business.  Looking at our performance, 2 themes stand out that are consistent across both print and personal systems. HP's broad and differentiated portfolio and leadership across consumer and commercial markets makes our company more resilient across business cycles. And secondly, our operational execution, including our disciplined pricing, strategic cost reductions and supply chain agility, help us navigate in a very dynamic environment. Underpinning it all is a purpose-driven culture built on strong corporate values. Our founders used to say that the greatest competitive advantage is doing the right thing at the worst time. And our teams have lived up to this ideal through a tremendously difficult year, consistently stepping up to do the right things for our business, our customers and our communities around the world.  This is who we are as a company, and I could not be more proud.  Now let me turn to our business and review the progress we have made against our strategy. We are advancing our leadership in our core market and expanding our reach into profitable adjacencies. We are positioning ourselves to disrupt new markets where our technologies and IP present significant opportunities to create and scale new businesses over time. And we are transforming the way we operate across the company with a focus on building out our cloud infrastructure and our digital capabilities, while reducing our cost structure. Our progress can be seen in each of our business units. It was another strong quarter for Personal Systems with revenue of $10.4 billion and a record 19 million units shipped. We grew consumer revenue 24%, with consumer premium up 29%, and consumer displays and accessory up 59%. Chromebook revenue and units more than doubled. We exited the quarter with an elevated backlog and continued to operate with component supply shortages, which are expected to constrain our growth through the first half of 2021.  The PC is more essential to daily life than ever before, and demand for our innovation remains strong. We launched a range of new products in our core compute categories last quarter. To meet the needs of professional creators and others that require uncompromising mobile computing performance, we unveiled our new ZBook Fury mobile workstations. We also announced a new lineup of HP ProBook and HP Spectre 360, and we expanded our Chromebook and Mobile Thin Client portfolios. And as PC gaming continues to surge in popularity, we debuted a range of new OMEN accessories, including the OMEN frequency wireless headset, OMEN Vector Wireless Mouse and OMEN Spacer Wireless Keyboard.  This momentum in gaming accessories reflects our broader focus on innovating in important adjacencies, including peripherals and services. During the second half of this year, we introduced a number of new monitors to improve the work-from-home experience, including always-on, low blue light to reduce eye strain and displays with increased touch capability. And we expanded our service offerings including a new device-as-a-service bundle, specifically designed to simplify life for small and medium businesses. We expect to see continued PC unit growth in 2021, which we anticipate will create additional opportunities for us to drive profitable growth as well as grow the lifetime value of our installed base by broadening our ecosystem of peripherals and services.  Turning to print. I am very pleased with the sequential growth in revenue, profit, supply and unit shipments. In Q4, the printing business generated revenue of $4.8 billion and operating profit of $713 million. We delivered a strong quarter relative to the market conditions. COVID-related effects on both supply and demand have continued to impact our printing results. From a demand perspective, ongoing demand for consumer hardware and supplies, combined with disciplined pricing, substantially offset the declines in commercial print. And from a supply perspective, while we began to replenish stock at our partners, we anticipate continued supply constraints on some consumer hardware and supplies SKUs. HP is outperforming its peers and remains uniquely well positioned, given our leadership across both consumer and commercial print. Our strong consumer business is a clear advantage for us as the shift to remote work and school continues to create momentum in home printing. We also saw some progress in commercial print, driven by the SMB sector. We expect a gradual recovery in the overall commercial print market. The recovery may be uneven given the varying pace of economic recovery and the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in some countries. And we expect that the strength in home will gradually subside when more offices and schools reopen. We continue to evolve our print business models with a drive toward services and a rebalance of profitability between hardware and supply.  Our Instant Ink subscription business continued to see rapid growth, with subscribers up double digits, surpassing our target of 8 million enrollees. We are making progress on rebalancing the business model between hardware and supplies. We are expanding profit upfront with 69% unit growth on [ Cs or big ink ]. We have improved consumer hardware ARU year-over-year through selective price increases, new product innovations and lower discounts. And earlier this month, we began the rollout of our much anticipated end-to-end platform strategy that we discussed at SAM last year. HP Plus, our end-to-end system, provides a differentiated value proposition for our loyal customers. We plan to extend HP Plus across most of our home and small office portfolio in developed markets as we roll out new products. Together, we expect these actions will help us to optimize the business by reducing the number of unprofitable customers.  We are also making progress against our plans to disrupt industries with our technology solutions and IP to drive medium- to long-term value creation. While the industrial businesses of graphics and 3D continue to be impacted by lower business activity due to the pandemic, we saw sequential improvement in both businesses as well as growth in strategic markets. In labels and packaging, for example, we had significant new system wins at ePac for flexible packaging and box maker for corrugated boxes, and [ impressions ] and square meters increased double digits year-over-year. In 3D, we continue to shift our focus toward more end-to-end solutions and higher value applications. For example, this quarter, we launched a new tooling solution to disrupt the molded fiber packaging sector. Molded fiber packaging covers thousands of products ranging from food and beverage containers to packaging for household goods and consumer electronics. We are excited for the disruptive potential in this sector as our innovative technology opens up entirely new possibilities. We are doing all of these while transforming the way we work to unlock value and become a leaner, more digitally enabled company. We have delivered on the foundational milestones that we outlined previously, and we are well ahead of our cost savings target this year. We have significantly reduced structural costs, driven productivity savings and enable enhanced digitization. Marie will go into more detail in a few minutes. And we are still in the early days of our transformation.  The progress we made in fiscal year '20 is indicative of the opportunities we see in fiscal '21 and beyond. These will remain a big area of focus as we continue to drive digital transformation and efficiency across the organization to position the business for growth. Let me sum up by reiterating the strength of our position as we enter fiscal 2021. A powerful blend of innovation and execution is driving our business forward. We have a diverse and resilient business model, are leading in our core market, investing appropriately in attractive growth opportunities and taking the steps necessary to transform for the future. We remain committed to generating strong cash flow and to value-creating capital allocation. This includes our robust share repurchase and dividend program and disciplined organic and inorganic investments.  We will continue to lead with our values of making a sustainable impact in the world, including stepped up efforts to support diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as to reduce our environmental footprint and mitigate the growing threats of climate change. These are business imperatives, where we have a deep and unwavering commitment. Before turning the call over to Marie, let me share some details on her background. Marie is both our Chief Transformation Officer and our acting CFO. She is a veteran of HP, having held a number of leadership position at the company, including as our controller. Prior to returning to HP earlier this year, she was CFO at UiPath. And as Chief Transformation Officer, her leadership has been integral to the cost savings we have delivered over the past year. I'm really grateful to have her leading finance through this transition.  I'll now pass it to Marie to review the financials. Marie Myers : Thank you, Enrique, for the kind introduction. It's great to be with all of you today. Q4 was a strong finish against a tough 2020 backdrop. With that said, our performance reflected the company's multiple profit levers, solid execution and resiliency. Before diving further into Q4, let me quickly recap FY '20 for the full year. We delivered revenue of $56.6 billion, down 2% in constant currency. We grew non-GAAP EPS 2%, which continues our trend of growing non-GAAP EPS every year since separation. We generated $3.9 billion of free cash flow, above our full year guidance. And we returned $4.1 billion, or 105% of free cash flow, to shareholders. Importantly, we've delivered these results while investing in our business for future growth and efficiency during the global pandemic. Our foundation is strong, including our balance sheet, and we have multiple levers to create value for our shareholders. Now let's look at the details of the fourth quarter. Q4 net revenue was $15.3 billion, down 1% year-on-year, or flat in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas increased 4%, EMEA decreased 1% and APJ decreased 6%. Gross margin was 17.6%, down 1.4 points year-on-year. The decline was due to a combination of a higher consumer mix within both Personal Systems and print hardware and lower rate in commercial print. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.6 billion, down $169 million. The decline in operating expenses was driven by our ongoing cost efficiency program as part of our transformation efforts as well as a reduction in discretionary costs. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $60 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased 3% to $0.62, with a diluted share count of approximately 1.4 billion shares.  Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $167 million related to onetime defined benefit plan settlement charges, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and other charges and partially offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits and other tax adjustments. As a result, Q4 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.49. Turning to segment performance. In Q4, Personal Systems benefited from solid demand related to working and learning from home with revenue of $10.4 billion, flat as reported, or up 1% in constant currency. Our top line remained constrained due to industry-wide supply shortages in CPUs and panels. Drilling into the details, we saw differing results by customer segment, with consumer revenue up 24%, while commercial revenue was down 12%. By product category, revenue was up 18% for notebooks, down 28% for desktops and down 45% for workstations. The change in mix reflected the strong demand for notebooks, mainly in Chromebooks, which represented 20% of our total Personal Systems units as working and learning from home continued. Personal Systems delivered $528 million in operating profit and operating margins of 5.1%, in line with our outlook and at the high end of our long-term range of 3.5% to 5.5%. Our results reflected the impact of a higher consumer segment mix within our portfolio and lower commercial rate, which were partially offset by cost reductions. In print, our results reflected strong execution and the team's agility as we continue to see a trade-off in demand between home and office print due to the pandemic. Within commercial office print, we did see some improvement driven by SMB. Importantly, HP remains uniquely well positioned in the print market by being a leader across both home and office with portfolio depth and resiliency to navigate these uncertain times. Q4 total print revenue was $4.8 billion, down 3% nominally and 2% in constant currency. By customer segment, consumer hardware revenue was up 21%, with units up 18% and commercial hardware revenue was down 22% on a 10% reduction in units. In total, hardware units were up 14% to 11.8 million units, a record since we became a separate company. Supplies revenue was $3.1 billion, flat in constant currency. In the fourth quarter, lower commercial printing was offset by consumer demand due to work- and learn-from-home, and disciplined pricing as well as replenishment of stock at our channel partners as product availability improved. Tier 1 channel inventory levels remained below the ceiling. Print operating profit was $713 million, and operating margins were 14.8%. The year-over-year decline was due to lower commercial print hardware rate and strong consumer hardware shipments, partially offset by strong supplies performance and OpEx reductions. Now let me turn to our cost savings and transformation efforts. We finished FY '20 ahead of the first year cost reduction target, which is 40% of our 3-year $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan. During this dynamic environment, we are also reducing discretionary costs as much as possible, even though they are more temporary in nature. To illustrate, we've seen significant operating expense reductions throughout the year, with Q4 non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue at 10.7%. We are focused on continuing to dive deeper into our transformational efforts. As an example, in FY '20, we have taken site optimization actions by exiting over 30 real estate sites to align with our location and mobility strategy. In addition, we have seen efficiency improvement in our customer service and support, driven by our continued shift to digital, which resulted in an over 300% year-over-year increase in virtual agent interactions in the second half of 2020. Finally, we continue to make progress in our new partner program, Amplify, which we announced last quarter to enable enhanced data analytics and provide partners with the capabilities, tools and insights required to capitalize on opportunities across the portfolio. As we head into FY '21, we are focused on further digital enablement and driving a lean cost structure because we believe it enables top and bottom line growth. Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Q4 cash flow from operations and free cash flow were strong at $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. The stronger-than-expected cash flow was driven by higher earnings and contributions from working capital. For Q1, we expect free cash flow to be softer than Q4, in line with typical seasonal patterns. In Q4, the cash conversion cycle was minus 30 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle was flat as normalized purchasing and sales drove decreases in days of inventory and days sales outstanding, offset by decreases in days payable outstanding. We returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and $238 million via cash dividends in Q4. For the year, we have returned a total of $4.1 billion, which represented 105% of free cash flow and a year-over-year increase of 22%. Today, we announced that we are increasing our dividend by 10%. Looking forward, we expect to continue buying back shares at elevated levels of at least $1 billion per quarter in the coming quarters. Heading into Q1, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. We expect macroeconomic conditions to be more uncertain as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. Turning to specific Personal Systems assumptions. Our backlog remains elevated and higher than the previous quarter, but we expect industry-wide CPU, panel and semiconductor constraints to continue to negatively impact our ability to meet demand, especially for notebooks, which will constrain top line growth. We expect continued strong demand in consumer and education pressure in commercial, particularly desktops and workstations. We expect the cost from the overall basket of commodities to be similar to Q4 levels. And from a margin perspective, we expect Q1 operating margins to be similar to Q4. In printing, from a demand perspective due to the pandemic, we expect to continue to see the positive demand for home printing, offset by more competitive pricing in home printing as well as continued economic pressure on commercial printing. We expect to continue to navigate the supply constraints with a focus on appropriately replenishing stock so that our partners are well positioned to satisfy demand. We expect our operating margin for Q1 to get into the long-term range of 16% to 18%. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following guidance for Q1. We expect first quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.70. And first quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.64. And now I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Huberty : Congrats on the quarter. The recovery in printing revenue was particularly impressive, especially with supplies revenue getting back to flat year-over-year in constant currency. But the operating margin was below your long-term range, and you're talking about getting back to that 16% to 18% operating range in the first quarter. So just curious what held operating margins back in the fourth quarter? And what are the factors allowing you to expand margins sequentially going into the fourth quarter? And then I have a follow-up -- or the first quarter? And then I have a follow-up. Marie Myers : So thank you, Katy. So let me provide you with some color around the print OP rate in Q4. So first of all, I'd start out by saying we had strong consumer hardware unit placements, which as you know, have negative margins upfront, coupled with the softness in commercial parts of our business, such as graphics and 3D, combined with lower volumes and higher costs. We're absorbing those costs across the portfolio. Plus, there has been some volatility that we experienced in our supply chain which resulted in some additional costs in the quarter and also in areas such as logistics, where we had a mix -- a higher mix of air shipments. So the print OP rate was also partially offset by supplies volume and pricing discipline. And in summary, that's what drove that decline in the rate in the quarter. As we look forward to Q1, there are some headwinds and tailwinds on cost. And we do expect that there will be some higher logistics costs, particularly in using sort of a stronger mix of air, but we do have some onetime-related COVID supply chain costs that we expect will be lower going into Q1. Kathryn Huberty : Okay, great. And then I appreciate you don't guide to revenue, but if we think about the PC and print revenue trends heading into the fiscal first quarter, what do you think those will look like relative to historical first quarter seasonality? Enrique Lores : Katy, thank you for the question. We expect most of the trends that we saw in Q4 to continue during Q1. If you look at the comments we made during the prepared remarks, we have seen very strong demand on the consumer side of both print and Personal Systems, strong demand of notebooks. We expect this to continue. While we also expect some of the limitations that we have from a supply chain perspective, because of availability of components, to stay at least through the first half of next year. These are kind of the key trends from the revenue side. Operator : Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : You commented a couple of times about a restock in printing. And I'm wondering if you can elaborate on specifically where, what magnitude and what parts of print supplies versus consumer or commercial hardware that was. It does look like the U.S. uniquely accelerated its growth rate in the quarter, whereas Europe and Asia were kind of flat to down. So was this rebuild in supply for channel partners largely centered in the U.S.? And I have a follow-up, please. Marie Myers : Toni, thanks for your question. Let me unpack the piece specifically around supply channel inventory. So there are a few drivers and there's a few different things going on in the quarter, so let me give you some context to you. So first of all, consumer demand, as you know, is being driven by this whole work and learn from home due to the pandemic. So it was offset by lower commercial printing. But in addition, we had better discipline in pricing in the quarter that was significant. And to put it in context, there were supply chain disruptions that we experienced earlier in the pandemic, and we've been doing some replenishment of our stock and channel partners in Q4 to help meet some of that demand from our customers. And we do expect to see that in Q1 as well. So -- and just in closing, finally, in supplies, we are below ideally where we'd like to be in terms of being below our ceiling on channel inventory. And maybe I'll turn it over to Enrique to give some context about... Enrique Lores : Yes. Let me address your comment about geographies, Toni, because when we look both at PC and printers in both hardware and supplies, our performance this quarter was more driven by supply chain than by demand. We are still limited in some of our -- in many of these categories from a supply chain perspective and the performance differences that you saw across regions were driven by how we allocated product not by where demand was coming from. We had very strong demand on the consumer front for consumer -- for PCs and for printers for every geography of the world. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. I'm going to use my follow-up to push a little bit on my first question. The supplies growth rate going from minus high-teens to essentially flat seems extraordinary. And it almost feels like in prior quarters, you drew down channel inventory. So that exacerbated how poor supply was because you didn't have availability. And this quarter, you replenished it. And all investors care about is, what is normalized supplies growth going forward? So it would be really helpful if you could speak to, specifically, how much restocking improved your supplies growth rate this quarter? And when we look to 2021, what is the realistic supplies growth rate for the year? Enrique Lores : Thank you for the question, Toni. As you know, we are not guiding anymore on supplies, but let me give you some color that I think will help you to understand in more depth what Marie was explaining before. During Q2 and Q3, we experienced some supply chain shortages that reduced our ability to supply demand to many of our key resellers. And this definitely, during Q4, as demand has continued to be very strong on the consumer side and sellers have replenished their stock, this has been a tailwind for us in the business. We expect this to continue in the early part of 2021 because we continue to see very strong demand on the consumer side of supply.  This consumer demand is really driven by people working from home and kids learning from home, which we also think is going to continue still for a few quarters, which is one of the reasons why our guide for Q1 was stronger than what market was expecting, because we expect to see this to continue happening. And finally, another element of the performance in supplies this quarter was the discipline in pricing that we drove. You probably have noticed that given the availability issues, we have removed promotions. There are very few promotions happening with HP supply. And this, combined with very disciplined pricing across the world, has also had a positive impact on revenue -- on supplies revenue this quarter. And again, some of it will continue -- we expect to continue in Q1. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Congratulations on a nice print, quite literally, from you guys. I guess my first one is on free cash flow. The performance here, I think in October quarter, is certainly much better than what most of us had modeled. So I'd love to understand, how did October quarter free cash flow stack up versus your expectations? And I guess when I think about the underlying levers behind the free cash flow, was there any pull-in from the early part of next year that sort of helped you guys out? So I would love to understand the levers beyond the free cash flow strength and any sense on how we should think about qualitatively or quantitatively about fiscal '21 free cash flow. Marie Myers : Sure, Amit. Look, first, I would start-up by saying, look, we're really pleased with our results here and what we saw in the quarter. As you know, we drove $1.8 billion free cash flow in Q4 and $3.9 billion in FY '20. And it was a record actually in a single quarter since the split. So that cash flow strength that you saw was really stronger-than-expected due to higher earnings, and frankly, the benefits of working capital, particularly in inventory and AP. And as you know, as we look forward into '21, just keep in mind that typically, our Q1 cash flow is usually lower, given normal seasonality. Enrique Lores : But the key -- as Marie was saying, the key drivers of free cash flow in Q4 were the strong earnings that we had and the benefit from working capital that is really, in many cases, driven by the strength of our Personal Systems business that we have commented before. And we are very pleased not only with the results of Q4, but really with the results of the full year where we have delivered the cash flow -- the free cash flow that we expected to see before the pandemic and that we shared with all of you in our investor meeting a year ago. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then if I could just follow-up on the supply side, obviously, the performance is much better than what I think, what you're seeing in the industry or your peers are seeing. But I'd love to understand, I mean, is there a bigger share gain dynamic or even a better mix dynamic because you've talked about consumer and SMB a fair amount, and I would imagine they tend to skew more ink-heavy, which might be much better for HP versus not. So could you just maybe talk about, is the mix shifting and that's perhaps giving you better sustainability for supplies as we go forward? I would love to just get better sense over there. Enrique Lores : Yes. Let me explain the dynamics that we are seeing in the print side. When we have 2 strong businesses in print, commercial and consumer, and our consumer business is getting a lot of benefit from people working from home, keep learning from home, and this has driven a strong demand for printers and strong demand for supply. Usage is above the expectations that we had before the pandemic started, and this is clearly having a positive impact in our business. On top of that, you know that our competitive position is relatively stronger in the home side, we have higher share of printers, higher share of supplies, higher share of pages. So as more demand goes to consumer, and to home, we clearly get a benefit from that. On the commercial side, we continue to see the impacts of the pandemic. The printing volumes continue to be significantly below where they were before the pandemic. Through the quarter, we have seen some improvement. But clearly, on the commercial side, still the pandemic is having a strong negative impact. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva : Congratulations on the results. I just have one question, and you can just answer it any manner you want. But the average life of a PC and also printers, it used to be kind of pretty consistent, I believe, around 4 years. Now that we're in a world of coronavirus and splitting time from school-at-school and school-at-home, and work-at-work and work-at-home, any thoughts about the average life of the PC? Will it be longer or shorter because you're using it in 2 different locations? Or how should we think about that as we go forward? Enrique Lores : Let me answer both, or what are we seeing for both PCs and print. In the case of PCs, more than the life of PCs changing, what we are seeing is a significant increase in the demand of PCs. PCs have become essential. People need it for working, for learning, for gaming, for entertaining for communicating. And the trend that we see is that for every person to have their own PC, and this is really driving significant demand on the PC side. On the printer side, what we see happening is both, we are seeing the additional demand for home printers as people and kids are learning and working from home, but we have also seen an extension of the life of printers because as people need to print, they are taking printers that have not been used for a while, and they are buying supplies for them, and they are using them. So you could position this as an extension in the life of the printers, which for us, of course, is a very positive impact because it means we allow people to enable people to print without having to invest in them buying a new printer. Jim Suva : Right. But my question is, once the -- everyone has a PC at home and a PC at work. After this has passed, any thoughts on the life of the PC after that essential purchase has been made? Do you think those kind of will still be the same length, or shorter or longer? Enrique Lores : I think we are still far from that position, Jim. We -- far from everybody having access to a PC in every -- in each of the countries where we do business. So we -- this is why we are confident that the demand for PCs is going to remain very strong during the next quarter. At the same time, in some areas, as you are saying, we are seeing there is so much need for PCs that PCs are being refurbished. Old PCs are being used. So we too could position as an extension in the life of the PCs. But we see this as a more short-term effect. What is really driving demand, and there is a long way to go, is the demand for every person to have their own PC. Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : I wanted to ask about your graphics and 3D printing business. I think you mentioned on the call that it was remaining weak, which was one of the impacts to operating margin in the printing business this quarter. How are you thinking about a rebound there? What are you hearing from customers in terms of willingness to take capital equipment or make capital equipment purchases? And perhaps maybe an update on your 3D printing business in general. And then I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Sure. So yes, we shared during the prepared remarks that both our industrial graphics printing and 3D printing overall continue to be impacted negatively by the pandemic. We have seen companies slowing down their investments in capital equipment and in industrial equipment overall, and this has impacted both businesses. What we have seen though is in many of the strategic areas that we have defined for those businesses, significant growth. We are seeing significant growth, for example, in labels and packaging, where both in flexible packaging and corrugated packaging, pages or, let's say, square feet and [ liters ] of ink are growing double digit year-over-year, which is a great confirmation that both that this business has a long-term opportunity, even if in the short term, it's been negatively impacted by the pandemic. And I would make similar comments for 3D. The investment in printers is being impacted by companies reducing their investment, but we continue to see the long-term opportunity. And we mentioned in our prepared remarks, a very important introduction for us this quarter, because we have shared in the past that we see in the future the need to complement our business in printer and supplies with the ownership of some end-to-end applications for high-value applications. And with the launch of our solution to create tooling for molded fiber, we are starting to move in that direction, which will allow us to capture more value as customers will be able to do with 3D printing, things that were not possible to do in the past. Shannon Cross : Okay. And my second question is with regard to your new print model, the HP Plus brand, which you just started to roll out. I realize it's early. But I'm curious as to how the conversations are going with Staples? Any initial conversations you've had with anyone, what you've seen on hp.com? And I think there's a call with -- in next week or in a couple of weeks, but I'm curious what you can tell us. Enrique Lores : Yes. Let me start from that. Since we know this is a topic that -- where there is a lot of interest. We have organized a special session with one of the teams where they will go in a lot of detail both about the model, the progress we have made and the plans that we have to roll it out across the portfolio and across the different countries during next year. But let me give you a few highlights now. First of all, we continue to be very excited about the opportunities that this new business model is going to create. We -- as you said, we launched this solution a couple of weeks ago in Staples. We launched 2 -- 3 printers, 1 laser printer and 2 ink printers, where we are starting to show the incremental value that it brings to loyal customers. So far, it's early to say what the reaction is, what we are encouraged by the initial responses, but we need to wait and see how it goes. But we continue to be very excited about the value this will create. Operator : Our next question comes from David Vogt with UBS. David Vogt : Maybe a little bit of a different topic. Can you give us an update on your structural cost reduction program? I think you mentioned on the call that you had exceeded your first year target of roughly 40% of the gross savings. What does that mean for year 2 and year 3 from a timing perspective and a magnitude perspective? And then I have a quick follow-up. Marie Myers : Sure, thanks. So as you know, that's actually my other role. And I would say, look, we're just very pleased with the progress and the program is very much on track. In terms of FY '20, we're ahead of schedule and higher, actually, than the 40% cost reduction plan that we'd originally highlighted. So I just would like to note that the OpEx reduction that you've seen this year were both a combination of structural and temporary reductions in areas like travel, events, et cetera, where we've been opportunistic because of COVID. So we are committed to staying on track and hitting our plans, and we do expect to achieve at least 75% of the $1.2 billion goal in FY '21. David Vogt : Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. In terms of your cash flow dynamics balanced by sort of the macro uncertainty that you talked about in your prepared remarks, has there been any change in thought in terms of how you would think about deploying your balance sheet, whether it's a change in maybe your target gross leverage ratio? Or I know you raised your dividend? Or is there any other sort of potential changes in your thought process from a capital allocation perspective? Enrique Lores : Thank you. We continue to remain true to the principles that we outlined in the value plan. Let me remind them to -- everybody, so to make sure we -- everybody is on the same page. We increased our leverage -- our target leverage ratio between to 1.5 and 2. We have committed to return 100% of our free cash flow over the long-term, unless higher return on investment opportunities show up. And this is what we plan to continue to do in the future. In the short term, we have increased the amount of shares that we buy every quarter. We bought this quarter $1.3 billion of share. We have announced that we plan to continue to buy at least $1 billion of shares every quarter during the following quarters. We have additionally increased dividend by 10%. And what we have also decided is given the uncertainty that we still see in the world, we're going to remain, for the foreseeable future, in the low side of the leverage ratio because we think it's the right thing to be prudent at this time given that many things could evolve in the world in the last 2 -- in the next 2 or 3 quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Roderick Hall : I wanted to come back to supplies and see Enrique, if you could talk a little bit, you mentioned that you removed promotions, and that's had a positive pricing effect. I wonder if you could talk about how much of a pricing effect that's had on a year-over-year basis. And then I have a follow-up to that. Enrique Lores : Yes. We don't disclose the specific details. I can tell you, this has been one of the key drivers of the revenue improvement that we saw in Q4. And as I said before, we expect it to continue to happen in Q1 and the early part of next year. And also, I would say that from a share perspective, we are meeting -- if we put aside the geographical differences, we are also meeting our share goals that we announced a few months ago. And the combination of usage, higher pricing, good results and good progress from a share perspective and some of the onetime effects that Marie was talking before are driving the performance that we see in supply. Roderick Hall : Okay. And then my follow-up to that was the other side of that equation, the unit declines in supplies. I wonder if you could talk about whether those were similar to Q3? Or were they lower than Q3? Enrique Lores : I guess, you mean the number of pages in commercial? Roderick Hall : Yes.  Yes. Enrique Lores : So let me give you some color... Roderick Hall : Not commercial. Total supplies units, however you want to quantify that. Enrique Lores : Yes. So let me give you some color on what we have seen. During Q4, if we look at Q4 compared to Q3 and the number of pages printed, there is an improvement between Q4 and Q3. But if we look at the evolution month by month, during the month of -- the 3 months of Q4, usage has been fairly stable, similar to what we saw at the end of Q3. So improvement quarter-on-quarter, but not much improvement since the end of Q3. In fact, what we have seen during the last few weeks, and this is more a Q1 comment, as with the pandemic growing and the number of cases growing in many countries, we have seen, again, a slowdown in the number of pages printed in commercial customers. And this is something that, of course, is already -- is built in our guide and built in the projections we have made. Operator : And our last question today comes from Matt Cabral with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Matthew Cabral : Yes. You mentioned on the PC side that you're seeing some elevated backlog exiting the quarter. Just wondering if there's any way to quantify that and talk about how big of a drag that was on the quarter. And then thinking about the supply constraints from here, just if you can comment on where you're seeing the biggest bottlenecks? And how long you think it will take to reach supply-demand balance going forward? Enrique Lores : Sure. Let me take the question. And I'm probably going to sound like a broken record because during the last 3 calls, I have been talking about the limitations that we have been facing because of supply availability. Let me tell you, this quarter, we faced significant. In fact, the backlog that we have at the end of Q4 is the biggest we have ever had. So it's not that the difference between supply and demand is being reduced, it's actually been increased. But it's all driven by increases of demand. Demand is easily driving. It continues to grow. And we expect that this situation will continue at least through the first half of our fiscal year 2021. So it's happening and it's here to stay at least for a couple of quarters. Matthew Cabral : Got it. And then speaking on PCs, it seems like there's a lot of moving pieces around margins heading into 2021. just wondering if you could talk about the puts and takes into Q1 and beyond on the PC side, and how we should think about things like the impact of Chromebooks versus desktops on mix and the impact of component costs going forward? Marie Myers : Matt, it's Marie. Maybe I'll take your question. So let me give you some color around the PS Q1 outlook. So we do expect those margins to be similar to Q4 back in the 3.5% to 5.5% range.  But I think a couple of points. First of all, the trends around work and learn from home are going to continue, and that will definitely continue to drive that mix to notebooks, and particularly into like those lower end ASP products. But we expect that to be somewhat offset by pricing discipline. And then from a revenue perspective, it will be slightly below normal seasonality given those supply constraints that we talked about, and our backlog will continue to remain elevated. So I think finally, supply chain is normalized, but there are some constraints around panels and CPUs, and this may impact our ability to meet that demand for notebooks.  Thank you. Enrique Lores : So thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. Before I wish you a great Thanksgiving for those of you living in the U.S., let me close with a few thoughts. What you saw during Q4 was the strength of the portfolio that we have. And the fact that we have a leading portfolio, both in consumer and commercial has really allowed us to deliver these results and to navigate the pandemic in a very strong way during the last quarter. We have also showed that the teams have really executed in this difficult time and they deserve a lot of credit in terms of their ability to identify opportunities, pivot the company and drive the maximum value that we could from those opportunities. We are very confident about Q1 and the guide that we provided today. Fiscal year '21 though, we have still a lot of uncertainty given where we are in the pandemic, but we know how to navigate the situation, and we know that -- and we are confident that we will continue to create value for our shareholders during next year. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Enrique Lores : Thank you, Beth and thank you everyone for joining the call today. I hope you and your families are safe and well. HP had an exceptional start to the year with strong revenue and profit growth in Q1. We are benefiting from the strength of our portfolio and the diversity of our businesses. We continue to evolve our business model to meet changing customer needs, while expanding into adjacencies to grow our addressable market. And we are driving an aggressive transformation agenda by rigorously managing our costs, while investing to drive future growth. Simply put, we are doing what we said we would do and our strategy is working. Our Q1 results are impressive across many dimensions. We delivered strong topline growth with net revenue up 7% to $15.6 billion and balanced growth across personal systems and print. We delivered strong bottom-line growth with $295 million in non-GAAP operating profit dollar flow through and double-digit profit growth in both personal systems and print. We delivered non-GAAP net earnings of $1.2 billion, up 24% with $0.92 of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share. This is up $0.27 compared to Q1 of last year. And finally, we delivered $908 million of free cash flow in the quarter. We also remain committed to a significant return of capital. We returned $1.6 billion to shareholders including $1.4 billion in share repurchases and $250 million in dividends. Over the last three quarters, we have returned $4.4 billion to shareholders and repurchased approximately 13% of our shares. At the onset of the pandemic, I told our teams that this is a time when strong companies find ways to emerge stronger. And last quarter results show that exactly what we are doing. HP's broad and differentiated portfolio and leadership across consumer and commercial markets make us more resilient across business cycles. We continue to capitalize on the strong demand for our offering particularly in consumer to drive profitable growth. Yes the impact of the pandemic is ongoing and the pace of the economic recovery remains uneven. We are continuing to manage our business in a disciplined and prudent manner while remaining agile in the face of change. This means capitalizing on opportunities when they arise, while also managing volatility when it occurs. As we balance all of these dynamics, we have stayed focused on executing against our strategy to advance our leadership in Personal Systems and Print by optimizing our core and expanding into attractive adjacencies, disrupt industries with our technology to create new businesses in areas like 3D, industrial print and microfluidics. And transform the way we work to be more digitally enabled and cost efficient. Our continued progress against these strategic priorities is reflected in the strong revenue and profit growth, free cash flow and capital returns we delivered in Q1 and in the positive momentum in each of our businesses. I will start with Personal Systems which had another strong quarter with revenue of $10.6 billion. We shipped more than 18 million units and generated operating margins of 7.1%. Consumer revenue growth accelerated to 34% with consumer premium up 34%, gaming up 29% and consumer accessories up 22%. And on top of this, Chromebook revenue quadrupled. We exited the quarter with a record backlog as we continue to operate with component supply shortages that are expected to constrain our growth through at least Q3. It's clear we have entered a new era of innovation and growth for PCs. They have become an essential part of how people work learn and play. And we continue to innovate to create new experiences. It's funny to say, but the PC is personal once again. And we are seeing this in the awards we are receiving. At last month Consumer Electronics Show, we introduced new devices and solutions to power hybrid work environment and personal creative studios. And we were recognized with over 70 awards for our latest launches, including our new 5G-enabled products. Looking ahead we expect to see continued PC unit growth through 2021, which we anticipate will create additional opportunities for us to drive profitable growth. We are also accelerating in attractive adjacencies such as gaming and peripherals. As with every market in which we play, our goal is to be a leader in this space. This week we announced the acquisition of HyperX, the market leader in gaming headsets. The addition of HyperX expands our presence in the growing peripheral market with a brand that is trusted by gamings around the world. Our existing strength in gaming hardware combined with portfolio spanning gaming headsets microphones and other peripherals will further expand our ecosystem and create another growth engine in Personal Systems. Much like Personal Systems Print is off to a terrific start to the year. This quarter demonstrated the power of print to help people learn, create and perform with 7% revenue growth, 16% unit growth and 32% profit growth. In Q1, our Printing business generated revenue of $5 billion and operating profit of $1 billion. Similar to the Personal Systems business, we remain supply constrained, particularly in consumer printer, hardware and supplies. While the COVID-19 related impacts on our manufacturing and supply chain have diminished, we anticipate these constraints to continue into the third quarter. HP is outperforming its printing peers and remain uniquely well positioned, given our leadership across both consumer and commercial print. Our strong consumer business is a clear competitive advantage as hybrid work and school becomes the norm. We have seen that people who didn't have home printers went and bought them and people sign up for Instant Ink in record numbers, accelerating and already growing part of our business. In Instant Ink, we added 1 million new subscribers surprising 9 million enrollees in the first quarter. Commercial print improved in Q1 with most product categories showing sequential revenue growth. In Q4, total print market units grew 6%. We continue to expect a gradual recovery in the overall commercial print market though the price might be an even given the very ink pace of economic recovery. And we expect that the strength in consumer will gradually subside as more schools and offices reopen. We continue to execute on our strategy to modernize print and evolve our print business models. In Q1, we roll out our end-to-end platform strategy called HP Plus that combined convenient Instant Ink and HP\u2019s Markup Services with innovative hardware. It's early days, but we are already seeing positive adoption. In the coming quarters, we will be rolling HP Plus out more broadly across multiple markets and product lines. New value propositions like HP Plus are indicative of the opportunities ahead as we continue to innovate to meet evolving customer needs. This also applies to our contractual businesses such as managed print services. Where we see attractive opportunities to deliver services, designed for the hybrid workforce of the future. One example is our HP Flex worker service. This service can be added to a company existing MPS contract to help remote workers maintain their productivity. This means being able to seamlessly print, scan and copies securely all while working from home. With leadership in both consumer and commercial and a strong track record of innovation HP is positioned to define and lead the future of printing in a post pandemic world. In city printing and industrial graphics, we continue to innovate across the portfolio to position ourselves for future growth. Customers continue to use Multi Jet fusion for production grade output and we are seeing more than 30% growth in the number of 3D printed parts across our customer base. We are also seeing strong early traction in our new molded fiber business that leverages our 3D printing technology to create an end-to-end service for quick customized and environmentally sustainable packaging. In industrial printing we continue to see growth in digital labels and packaging with double-digit growth in impressions and square meters printed. Georgia Pacific one of the world's largest packaging and paper goods providers is deploying their third Inkjet web press to expand their digital printing business. This is a great milestone and validation of our technology. We are excited for the disruptive potential in this sector as our innovative technology opens up entirely new possibilities in personalization and digital manufacturing. We are doing all this while continuing to transform the company to unlock value and become a leaner more digitally enabled company. Our transformation journey continues to be ahead of plan. We have significantly reduced structural costs and driven productivity savings. At the same time we are enabling enhanced digitization and we are shifting investments to attractive growth areas where we see opportunities for us to continue driving innovation and long-term sustainable growth. We are focused on both reducing structural costs and accelerating investments for the future. Recently, we announced several new appointments to further strengthen HP's innovation capabilities and support its long-term growth strategy. Savi Baveja joined as our Chief Strategy and Incubation Officer and Tolga Kurtoglu had joined HP as Chief Technology Officer. In this role they will drive cutting-edge research and incubate new business opportunities working together with the leadership team. And last week, we named Marie Myers as our Chief Financial Officer. Marie is a veteran of HP, having held a number of leadership positions at the company, including as our Controller and most recently as our Chief Transformation Officer. Marie and I have worked together for many years and she's a truly outstanding leader. I know you will all enjoy getting to know her better. Overall, I am very pleased with the way we have started the year. We built on our momentum from the end of 2020 and our teams are performing at a very high level. And on top of delivering strong results, we are also staying true to HP's values. Last quarter, HP was recognized by Newsweek as America's most responsible company for the second straight year. And we appear on the Barron's list of 100 most sustainable companies for the third straight year. In December, we were named one of the 10 best managed companies by the Wall Street Journal. This accolade simply means that we continue to ensure that making a sustainable impact remains an integrated part of our business strategy. Let me close by saying Q1 was a strong quarter that increases our confidence about the opportunities ahead. We have a diverse and resilient business model. We are leading in our core Print and Personal Systems market, while taking the steps necessary to create and scale new businesses for the future. And our strong cash flow generation provides us flexibility to return significant capital to shareholders and reinvest in businesses, while also exploring disciplined M&A. We believe this is a time when strong successful companies like HP can get stronger. We are not running our business to achieve incremental improvements. We are driving a much bolder transformation agenda that will expand our portfolio, fuel innovation and unlock attractive new sources of long-term growth and value creation. That is our ambition. With that I will turn the call over to Marie who will take you through the details of the quarter and our fiscal year outlook. Marie, over to you. Marie Myers : It's great to be with all of you today and I wanted to thank Enrique for his trusted me as his finance partner. I'm excited to take on the CFO role after more than two decades at HP. I'm looking forward to getting to know the investment community as I settle into my new role. It's clear that HP remains focused on executing each quarter, while also positioning the company for the future. And our results demonstrate this balance of delivering in the near-term, while investing in growth and leading through this dynamic environment. Q1 was a very strong quarter, we grew revenue non-GAAP operating profit dollars faster than revenue and non-GAAP EPS even faster. We are off to a strong start for the year. And overall, we are very pleased with our results. Now let's look at the details of the first quarter. Q1 net revenue was $15.6 billion up 7% both nominally and in constant currency. Regionally in constant currency, Americas increased 17%, EMEA increased 3% and APJ decreased 5%. Gross margin was 21.2% and up 1.6 points year-on-year. The increase was driven by favorable pricing and commodity costs in Personal Systems and favorable pricing in printing, particularly, in consumer hardware. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.8 billion, up $157 million. The increase in operating expenses was driven by investments to position for future growth and an increase in certain one-time expenses. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $63 million for the quarter, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased 42% to $0.92 with a diluted share count of approximately 1.3 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $120 million, primarily related to restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangible assets, other tax adjustments and partially offset by non-operating retirement related credits. As a result, Q1 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.83. Turning to segment performance. In Q1, peripheral systems benefited from strong demand related to working and learning from home with revenue of $10.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Our top-line remained constrained due to industry-wide component shortages. Drilling into the details, we continue to see differing results by customer segment with consumer revenue up 34% while commercial revenue was down 6%. By product category, revenue was up 23% for notebooks, down 18% for desktops and down 36% for workstations. Strong demand for notebooks drove total unit growth of 15% year-over-year with Chromebooks representing 16% of our total personal systems units as the need for technology and education continued to grow. Personal systems delivered a record $758 million in operating profit and operating margins of 7.1% much higher than our outlook. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to favorable pricing, including fewer promotions and favorable commodity cost. In print, our results reflected very strong execution as we continue to benefit from the strength of our portfolio as a leader across both consumer and commercial print. Q1 total print revenue was $5 billion, up 7%. By customer segment, consumer revenue was up 55% with units up 18% and commercial revenue was down 11% and flat in units. In total, hardware units were very strong at 11.1 million units, up 16%. Supplies revenue was $3.1 billion, up 3%. In the first quarter, ongoing consumer demand combined with favorable pricing and inventory replenishment more than offset lower commercial demand. Sequentially, supplies revenue was flat. Print operating profit was very strong at $1 billion and operating margins were 19.8%. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to favorable pricing including fewer promotions. Let me now turn to our transformation efforts and specifically our cost savings opportunities. In Q1 about 700 people exited the company as we continue to be ahead of plan against our three-year $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan. During the quarter, we continued to execute real estate site optimization activities at six sites that are aligned with our location and mobility strategies. In addition, we have achieved additional efficiency improvements in customer service and support as we continue to shift to digitization and automation. Finally, we continue to be focused on further digital enablement and driving a lean cost structure as it provides us the flexibility to reinvest in other areas of our business. Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. First quarter cash flow for operations and free cash flow were solid at $1 billion and $908 million, respectively. In Q1, the cash conversion cycle was minus 30 days. Sequentially the cash conversion cycle was flat as growth in inventory primarily driven by strategic buys and finished goods drove increases in days of inventory offset by increases in days payable outstanding. Days sales outstanding also decreased during the quarter. For the quarter we returned a total of $1.6 billion to shareholders which represented 179% of free cash flow. This included $1.4 billion in share repurchases and $250 million in cash dividends. Looking forward, we expect to continue buying back shares at elevated levels of at least $1 billion per quarter in the coming quarters unless higher return opportunities emerge. Looking forward to the second quarter and the rest of fiscal 2021, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. While we expect year-over-year revenue growth in FY 2021 to reflect our continued progress on our strategy, it is also important to note that growth trends in Q2 and Q3 will also reflect the easier year-over-year comparisons due to the unusual COVID related impacts we saw last year. And in the second half of the year, we expect to see a more normalization of the market environment, as more people return to the office and kids returned to, school and as the pricing environment normalizes. Our outlook range is broader than usual given the current market environment. We are modeling multiple scenarios related to supply availability, pricing dynamics and the pace of economic re-opening. Our comments for Q2 are the following. In Personal Systems our backlog remains elevated as demand in consumer and education remains very strong. And we expect industry-wide component constraints to continue to negatively impact our ability to meet demand, especially for notebooks which will constrain top line growth. We expect the cost from the overall basket of commodities to be slightly higher compared to Q1 levels. And from a margin perspective, we expect Q2 operating margins to be in the range of Q1 margins. In Printing, from a demand perspective we expect to continue to see strong demand for home printing as well as the continued economic pressure in commercial printing. We expect to have to navigate supply constraints and the need to replenish stock so that our ecosystem of partners, are well positioned to satisfy the strong demand that we see in printers and supplies. We expect that our operating margin for Q2 to be at the high end of our long-term range of 16% to 18%. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following guidance for Q2 and FY 2021. We expect second quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.90. And second quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.88. We expect FY 2021 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.25. And FY 2021 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.98 to $3.08. For FY 2021, we expect our free cash flow to be at least $4 billion. And now, I would like to hand it back to the operator. And open the call for your questions. Question-and: Operator : Thank you. We will now being the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. And Marie, I just wanted to congratulate you on the new role. My question I'm going to -- it's a two-part question, so I'll just leave it to one question today. I was wondering, Enrique, can you talk a bit about sustainability and sort of beyond the quarter that you've guided to? And that's one of the big questions I think people have right now. Maybe if you can -- you put it to shortages in PCs lasting until third quarter. So maybe you can talk on the PC side a little bit about what you see long-term for the market? And what might support the PC business sort of in future quarters. And then, if you could turn to printing, if you can talk a bit about what Print Plus means for the long-term model? And how you see that impacting margins as well as discussing a bit, because I think maybe it's underappreciated how the shift to Inkjet is going to help margins long-term since you own the whole Inkjet stack and have to partner with Canon for laser. So if you could maybe address those two parts, that is my -- completes my question. Thanks. Enrique Lores : Okay. Thank you Shannon and I will try to answer all your points. So let me start with sustainability of the momentum that we see. And I would say that, we are very optimistic about what we -- what are our expectations for the market for the coming quarters. We think that many of the underlying trends that are driving demand today are going to stay. I think the pandemic has made technology clear necessary for people to work to entertain to live. And this is going to continue to drive very strong demand for PCs and for home printers for the foreseeable future, but especially for PC. We also think that as offices will reopen. We are going to see an increase of demand on the PC space because will have to invest on PCs again to make their employees productive. And we are going to continue to see a shift towards notebooks that also helps on the demand side as the renewal cycles are shorter. We also think that the need to -- the hybrid model of working between office and home opens new opportunities for us on the printing side to offer new services create new services by combining both. So overall again, we see that this is creating an opportunity for us not only to leverage new opportunities, but really to continue to drive change and to continue to gain momentum. If I go now to the second part of your question on PCs, we expect to continue to see very strong demand for PCs in the coming quarters. And this strong demand is what is creating the supplies the component shortages that you were mentioning. We have provided strong guidance today both for the quarter and for the year. And this is based of course on the visibility that we have today for components what we think we are going to be able to hit, if we get more components we could do even better. And then your final question on Print. As you know we launched HP Plus during last quarter the reception has been very positive in terms of both adoption of the end-to-end model and also feedback from customers in terms of the value proposition and feedback from partners. So going I would say, we are optimistic about the results we have seen. And as you know we are going to expand into more countries and more categories during the coming months until we complete the rollout in the middle of 2022. You were also asking about the impact on margins. Let me start there and maybe Marie will complement that. Clearly we see a benefit from the mix moving into India later because as you know we end the full end-to-end system. But this quarter we are also seeing a strong benefit from pricing. Especially on hardware that is really helping to increase the profitability on print. Marie Myers : And yes. Thank you for your Shannon. Yes look we expect our print margins to remain strong throughout FY 2021 and we expect our operating dollars to grow an operating profit rate to be at the higher end of the 16% to 18% range for 2021. And in Q2 we'd expect to be above the range as well. Operator : And our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. I want to ask a clarification first. You said in your prepared remarks that you see PCs growing through 2021, does that mean that you will see growth in each of the four quarters? Obviously you grew strong in 1Q? Or is that just implying that you will grow for the full year? And then in terms of my question just following up on the print business can you talk about how much channel inventory rebuild contributed to print revenue in the quarter. And Marie you made it clear that you expect Print margins at the upper end of the range, but why would they come down sequentially given that the pricing environment remains quite favorable? Enrique Lores : Okay. Thank you, Katie. Let me start with a clarification. When I was talking about PC growth to continue, I was referring to market. As I was saying in answer to Shannon, we expect the market to continue to be very strong both this year and in the long term. And then let me offer a data point. If we look at the projection that we have for PC market in 2021, the one we have now and we compare it to the projection that we have for 2021 before the pandemic started the market is 45% bigger. So this talks about the growth that we have seen in PCs and really the -- why we are so optimistic about this business going forward. And now Marie will talk about the margins for print in Q1. Marie Myers : Actually I was going to move on and just cover your question around channel inventory Katy. So look with respect to that overall channel inventory is below what we believe are healthy appropriate levels for print. And that's really as a result of that strength that we're seeing in consumer. And right now we're also below the range and that's driven by that demand in home. We do expect however some replenishment of stock throughout our partner ecosystem into Q3 and that's going to help to bridge some of that demand from our customers. So overall, we want to make sure that our partner ecosystem is very well positioned to satisfy that demand. Operator : Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. Thank you. I have two questions as well. First, if I look at your guidance for the full year, it implies an EPS decline at the midpoint down more than 20% in the second half versus the first half. Typically seasonality would point to EPS being up 10% in the second half. So I was wondering if you can comment on that. Are you being conservative? Because it sounds like you're going to be supply-constrained through potentially Q3, or are you believing that this very favorable price environment is going to come off. So are you expecting this deceleration because of conservatism? Are you expecting it because of weaker than normal sequential revenue growth? Or are you expecting it because you expect margins to go down to lower levels in the second half? And then I have a follow-up please. Marie Myers : Right. Hey, Toni, good afternoon. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, look, frankly Toni we've provided actually a very strong guide for the year. And we're investing for our future. In fact, we expect revenue growth in FY 2021 and EPS to be up 38% to 43% and free cash flow growth as well. So, while to your point this is front-end loaded in the first half, the second half EPS growth is actually 23% to 32% of the 111 that we actually delivered last year. And this actually includes earnings growth as well as the benefit of lower shares. So given the current environment as you could imagine we are modeling multiple scenarios for the second half. So look all-in-all, we believe that this is a prudent guide based on what we know today. And clearly, if we can do better we absolutely will. Toni Sacconaghi :  Okay. I guess, I was trying to get a better sense of whether there was more confidence in the revenue trajectory or the margin trajectory. But just in terms of the follow-up, I want to better understand this restocking whether this is hardware or supplies are both on the print side is it principally consumer. So I presume your stock is going down on the corporate side since demand is much weaker and your channel inventory in dollars is going up on the consumer side and that's obviously very, very favorable. But you talked about this being a benefit last quarter this being a benefit this quarter that's potentially being a benefit next quarter. I'd like to understand exactly what that benefit is. And then maybe you could kind of zoom out a bit and just talk about how we should think about normalized supplies growth. I think over the last eight or nine years, it's gone down about 4% per year. The aspiration was to get to flat supplies growth. I think it took you a little longer to get there. You haven't really provided an update on how you think about supplies growth sort of in a more normalized environment how should we think about that? Thank you. Enrique Lores : Great. Thank you Toni. Let me start and let me emphasize that we are very confident on both the revenue and profit projections for the year and this is what supports the strong guide that we have provided today. In terms of channel inventory the comments from that we made in the prepared remarks are not only for supply, but also for hardware, and we continue to be across the board in PCs, printers and supplies below what we think are the ideal inventory levels that we have for the channel. So that's -- this is where we are today. And all this is driven by the very strong demand that we continue to see especially, on our home products. And now let Marie explain what do we see on supplies? And what do we think is an impact on the replenishment this quarter? Marie Myers :  And thanks Enrique. So Tony, looking at supplies performance there's sort of really three key dynamics to discuss. First of all, ongoing demand in consumer supplies with work-from-home and learn-from-home and there are ongoing challenges in commercial print as you know. And then secondly there's that favorable pricing environment, which was actually a tailwind. And then thirdly, the year-over-year compares also benefited from that replenishment of stock which was consistent with what we had indicated on the call in Q4. Now if you adjust for the impact of inventory movements, we estimate that supplies revenue was down roughly a 1% year-on-year. As you know, we have a multi-tiered channel. So this is our best estimate based on the data we have including our estimates for product across the channel and end-user stock. So this replenishment should have a short-term benefit to supplies revenue. Enrique Lores :  I'm commenting on the projections for the future, Tony. As you know, we are -- we have redesigned the strategy of the company to reduce the dependency on supplies to deliver our goals. This is why the subscription programs HP Plus are so critical. And we are very pleased with the progress that we're making on that front. We shared in the prepared remarks that we reached nine million subscribers on Inc. which means we added one million subscribers this quarter which is the factor and the most we have done in the history of the program. So clearly that is accelerating. And at the same -- as I also shared before, we are really pleased with the response that we have got on HP Plus and we are also making good progress on what we call big ink and big toner for in emerging countries which are a key part of our strategy as well. Operator :  Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani :  Perfect. Thank you. It looks like I really have no printing questions for you guys anymore. But I do want to talk about free cash flow. And if I look at the fiscal 2021 guide I think you talked about $4 billion of free cash flow. It's really a modest uplift from the $3.9 billion we did in fiscal '20. So really just help me understand with revenue up the way it is and I think EPS is going to be up 35%, 40%, why is free cash flow up $100 million and change? Just what are the puts and takes that would be really helpful? Marie Myers : Yes. Good afternoon, Amit. So first of all, look at start-up and saying look, we're really pleased with the results of free cash flow and what we saw in the quarter. Now as we look forward to FY 2021 a bit, we expect free cash flow as I said in my prepared remarks to be at least $4 billion and in that is being driven by the earnings growth in both PS and print. And it is being sort of the headwind that we do have is it will be partially offset by changes in working capital, which we expect to -- from higher expected inventory and AR. And that's being driven obviously by the environment that we're in with PS. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then I guess, Marie, really from your perspective as you step into the CFO role and your background as the Chief Transformation Officer. I'd love to get a sense on as you go forward how do you go between managing the need to reduce costs and optimize margins versus perhaps investing for growth as you go forward? And as you think about HP over the next two, three years, what are the big priorities for the company for investments? Marie Myers :  No. Thanks, Amit. Look, frankly, I believe that great companies like HP focus on the end. We have to do both. We have to reduce costs and we have to make the right investments for the future. So I can tell you as the CFO, I'm going to be relentless about going after inefficiency and making sure we're driving value from our investments. I think my role is the Chief Transformation Officer really teed me up nicely for that outlook. Now with respect to investments, I'm going to turn it over to Enrique to add some color there. Enrique Lores : And before I do that let me emphasize the comment from Marie about the end. We need to continue and we will continue reducing cost and we will continue to invest in areas where we see opportunities for the future. And my answer is not going to surprise anybody because this is the strategy we have been executing during the last years. It's about modernizing our core businesses both personal systems and print. We see opportunities to create value on both, it is about expanding into adjacencies. And yesterday, we shared the acquisition of HyperX that is an example of a very attractive adjacency for us, and we are also investing to create new businesses in industrial graphics in 3D printing, in microfluidics. And we see also the need to invest in improving our digital infrastructure that will help us to create new business model, but as Marie was saying, also to become more efficient leaner and really being able to respond to our customers in a better way. This is the strategy, we have been executing. The results show that it is growing and this is where we are going to be investing going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Matt Cabral : Yeah. Thank you. Enrique, you just mentioned Hyperx. I wanted to dig a little bit more into that. I guess, first just a clarification. I saw in the release you guys said, it's EPS accretive, but wondering if you guys can comment on the revenue contribution you expect from Hyperx going forward? And then more broadly, just wondering for your perspective on PC gaming and just how we should think about sustainability there once people start leaving their homes in a more normalized manner? And just how you think about Hypera's peripheral spitting versus your OMEN brand within the lineup? Enrique Lores : So first of all, let me start on gaming. Gaming is a very attractive opportunity for us both on the hardware side, where we have been growing significantly during the last quarter and where we expect to continue to see growth in the coming years. More and more people are using gaming at their main entertainment and this is driving growth today and will continue to drive growth in the future. When we look about gaming the peripheral opportunity is especially attractive. A gamer spends about 15, 16 more money on accessories than a normal PC user. And when we think about that opportunity the acquisition of Hyperx makes us really excited about the opportunity of really capturing that. Hyperx is the leader in gaming headsets they have a very strong portfolio on microphones mic keyboard. And really the growth \u2013 the value proposition of the acquisition is very clear. We are going to accelerate that growth by leveraging our geographical presence and our broader retail presence, as well as we will be taking their portfolio and expanding into new segments like commercial. Soil is all about growth and this is \u2013 and this growth is what makes it accretive for us in 2022. Matt Cabral : Thanks for that. And as my follow-up, I wanted to broaden out the discussion on M&A and just talk about how you think about M&A strategically, and I heard in the prepared remarks that the plan is still outsized buybacks and less a better opportunity comes along. So maybe just help us understand the criteria you think about that trade-off between repurchases and other uses of capital going forward? Enrique Lores : Our approach has not changed from what we have been communicating during the last quarter. We continue to believe that our stock is undervalued and we are going to continue to buy aggressively our shares. Marie mentioned that, we are going to be buying at least $1 billion of shares every quarter. And at the same time, we are always looking for opportunities to accelerate our strategies through M&A. We are looking at opportunities in the core businesses in adjacencies, and also to support our new businesses. And the criteria are very simple. Any M&A, we will do \u2013 will have to be aligned to the strategies we have explained. I will have to have attractive financial returns at a minimum a better ROI than buying our own stock. And third, we need to have a strong operational plan to execute on the value proposition of the acquisition. These are the criteria we have been applying. This is what we used to decide to acquire Hyperx and this is how we think about M&A. Operator : Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Krish Sankar : Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the solid results. And Marie congrats on the full-time CFO title. I have two quick questions. First, Enrique or Marie, is there a way to quantify what would be the upside to revenues if you had no supply constraints? And then I had a quick follow-up. Enrique Lores : Let me take the question. What you have in the guide is what we think we \u2013 based on the current supply that we see available, we can deliver, of course, if there was more supply, we will be able to drive more, but I don't think we will quantify what this number is. But let me tell you is, as I said in the prepared remarks, our backlog is at a record high. So it will be a significant number. But again, we are seeing shortages given how strong the demand is across the board. Krish Sankar : Got it. Got it. Thanks, Enrique for that. And then as a quick follow-up. The gross margins in the January quarter were really strong. What were the drivers there? And how to think about gross margin for the rest of the year, especially as component costs get inflationary for you folks? Marie Myers : Yeah. Shankar thanks for the kind words. So look fundamentally, it's just all about demand frankly outpacing supply and really creating that favorable environment. So it's basically just the laws of supply and demand which helped us with better pricing in the quarter. So regardless of whether you're sort of talking year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter that improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by favorable pricing which showed up as fewer promotions and as cost improvements. Operator : Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you can go back to print margins for a second and look at this on a quarter-on-quarter basis. When we look at the sequential revenue improvement that was about $200 million in Print the Print profitability went up by $300 million. So maybe you can help us think through how much of that was pricing on hardware where there is fixed cost leverage that you might be recognizing versus higher mix on HP Inc. versus laser tower. If there's a way to dissect this somewhat differently in the $300 million and purely replenishment has a role there too, any way to maybe size those different components? And also if we can split between hardware and supplies I think that would give us a better sense of how the trajectory of this good progress? Thank you. Marie Myers : Sure, no thanks for your question. And so look the Print rate really benefited from improved gross margins, particularly in home hardware and that was driven by that favorable pricing that I mentioned earlier. And it was particularly in the consumer side. And some of those -- and then we had reductions from COVID-related supply chain costs that we had in Q4 and then that was partially offset by higher consumer mix and lower supplies mix. So that and all is what contributed to the rate. And overall we're seeing the strength and resiliency of our broad Print portfolio and leadership across customer segments and that's really positioned us very well against our competition. Wamsi Mohan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from David Vogt with UBS. David Vogt : Great. Thank you. Maybe just going back to the component shortage issue for a second. It's been persistent for some time now and there's been commentary across different industries that lead times are lengthening across the board. I know inventory is up this quarter 49 days 43 last quarter. But can you give us more qualitative discussion on how you're thinking about remediation going forward in your future procurement plans. In case there's a greater disruption and what that might mean for your top line going forward? Thanks. Enrique Lores : Sure. So as I said before, the shortages that we are seeing are really driven by the very strong demand that we are getting across the full portfolio. We of course are taking any action we can to mitigate the impact and make sure that we can deliver even more than what we have in the plan. One of the big things that we have decided as Marie mentioned before is to increase the amount of inventory that we have on hand. This will help us not only to increase the delivery of the shipment of products, but also to be able to ship more products in case some components are made available during the quarter.  We are also building direct connection with suppliers that until now will be managed from our ODMs usually suppliers of low-cost components because we have seen that it's important to really establish a direct connection with them and in some cases even buy products directly from them. And this I would say are the two big things that we have already done and that we expect will help us to manage the situation during the coming quarters. David Vogt : And maybe just a quick follow-up on that. So when you think about sort of the inventory that you're taking in and that you're going to procure going forward, is there any sort of commentary or guidance you can give us in terms of what the margin impact might look like from that inventory today going forward as you burn through that inventory maybe later this year into next fiscal year? Enrique Lores : I think given how strong our demand is if you are concerned about obsolescence of some of the inventory, I think the risk is extremely low because we really have very strong demand and we expect it to continue during the coming quarters. In terms of cost of components, we are expecting that in some cases cost will be increasing during the coming quarters but all of this is built into our guidance, and built into the comments that Marie made before in terms of operating margin during the coming quarters. Marie Myers : And just a follow-up on Enrique's comment. As a result then we would expect from an overall basket of commodity pricing perspective for those prices to be higher than what we've seen in Q1 going forward as well. Operator : Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva : Thank you very much and congratulations on the very strong results and outlook. When we dive \u2013 I have one question. When we dive into the results on PCs, yes you are growing, but it seems like some of your competitors, especially your North America competitors growing much stronger than you. You did highlight that you grew a lot in Chromebook. So I'm wondering is the strategy there to really focus on education and Chromebooks or profit share gains or market share maintaining, even if you lose some share? I just wanted to revisit your strategy in the PC side, when we look at the data versus the industry? Enrique Lores : Sure. Let me be very clear Jim. So we had a very strong quarter in absolute terms on PCs, revenue growth, unit growth, profit growth but we didn't on relative terms. And being as competitive as we are, this is not something that we are satisfied about. As I explained before, we are looking at what can we do and what will we do to improve our relative performance. We have already taken some actions to do that by increasing inventory and changing how the connections that we have with certain component providers and this will be helping us to improve our performance going forward. We are really using this as a catalyst to optimize even further our operational capabilities and this is what great company do and what we will continue to do, because again, we like to win and this is what we will continue to do going forward. Enrique Lores : So having said that, I think we are close to time. So let me use this as an opportunity to wrap up. First of all I want to repeat some of the comments I made during the prepared remarks. We are doing what we said we would do. And our strategy is working. We have had a very strong start of the year and we are confident in the projections that we have for 2021 and beyond. We see growth opportunities in our core markets in the adjacencies and also in the new businesses that we are creating. And we are really leveraging the opportunities that we see to accelerate our strategy, accelerate our growth, which gives us great confidence in the future of the company. So again, thank you for joining us today and looking forward to continue to talk to all of you in the future. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded.

Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining the call. I want to start by acknowledging the state of the pandemic, particularly in countries such as India. We are doing everything we can for our employees, customers, and partners during this difficult time. While some parts of the world are beginning to improve and reopen, there is much more work to do. Turning to our results, it was another exceptional quarter of double-digit top and bottom-line growth in which we delivered well above our guided range. Our performance reflects the relevance of our technology in an increasingly high level, the resilience of our business model, and the operational excellence of our team. In addition to summarizing our results, I also want to highlight secular trends driving sustained demand across our portfolio. HP technology and services are at the heart of hybrid [ph] work. We are accelerating our strategy to drive long-term sustainable growth. This includes continuing to transform the way we operate and deploy our substantial cash flow to maximize value creation. Let me start with the quarter. In Q2, we saw exceptional demand for our products and delivered record revenue of $15.9 billion, an increase of 27% with balanced growth across Print and Personal Systems. Our non-GAAP net earnings increased 56% to $1.2 billion, and we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow, returning $1.8 billion to shareholders. These results reflect continued strong growth in consumer as well as improvement in our commercial businesses as economic activity increased. In our consumer segment, we delivered 72% growth in Personal Systems and 77% growth in Print. Commercial PC revenue grew 10% and Commercial Print was up 34%, including 45% growth in our Industrial printing businesses. It is important to note that these results are against the backdrop of industry-wide component shortages and supply chain challenges. Currently there is not enough supply to keep up with the robust demand, and the resurgence of COVID in Southeast Asia is creating additional pressures on our supply chain. We expect supply constraints to continue at least through the end of 2021. Although the environment will likely remain dynamic, we are taking actions to navigate through the challenges, enabling us to deliver strong results and increase our outlook for the second half. As we remain focused on delivering in the short-term, we are equally focused on capitalizing on attractive long-term opportunities. It is clear that the world will not simply go back to the way it was prior to COVID. There has been a fundamental shift in the way people work, learn, play, and create, and this shift is here to stay. The future of work and education will be more hybrid. According to recent survey, more than 60% of employees want flexibility in where and how they work. By this future merger [ph], it will open the opportunity to create new products and services for our customers. And as consumers and businesses see greater mobility, convenience, and value, this supports our strategy to accelerate new business model here through more services and subscriptions enabled by the integration of our hardware and software. Underpinning all of this is a growing importance of cybersecurity. 88% of IT decision makers tell us a war with [ph] cyber risk has increased during the pandemic. This presents a huge opportunity for us to expand our security offerings and deliver the most secure and resilient PCs and Printers. With our broad differentiated portfolio, HP is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these secular trends. And I think I've said this is a time for strong companies to get stronger and we are innovating across our portfolio to strengthen and grow our businesses. In Personal Systems, our innovation is driving growth in key segments, including remote work, education, and gaming. The PC continues to be essential in daily life. We are already capitalizing on these trends in a number of ways. Our latest award winning PC\u2019s include features purpose-built for hybrid work, and we are developing new services like HP Provision in Connect that make it easier for IT teams to set up and support devices in employee's homes as well as in the office. In the education market where HP is the number one vendor, PC sales have more than doubled due to remote learning. At the same time, however, the number of PCs per hundred students remains in the single digits. As an industry, we still have a long way to go to close this digital device; and as a company, we have a big opportunity to be part of the solution. The importance of the PC extends far beyond work and school. In many cases, this has become the entertainment center of the home from streaming and content creation to the rise of gaming and eSports. In Q2, revenue growth in gaming outpaced overall consumer PC growth. We are building on this strength to expand into attractive adjacencies, including peripherals. We are on track to close a hyper acquisition in Q3. We do expect to be accretive in year one. In Printers, we are leveraging our leadership across consumer and commercial market to provide innovative solutions needed in today's hybrid world. This includes accelerating the evolution of our business model and subscription services. We recently announced the expansion of HP+ an Instant Ink, which are now in 35 countries across North America and Europe. We believe HP+ will help us to optimize system profitability and provide a better customer experience. Additionally, employers are looking for more distributed printing environment, which plays to HP's strength in [indiscernible]. The new LaserJet Enterprise 400 series is designed to deliver seamless remote management for both hybrid workers and new office configurations [steered] to our collaboration. At the same time, greater workforce mobility is a catalyst for our Print Services portfolio. Within our managed Print Services, we have introduced HP Flexworker Service to incorporate remote workers and branch officers into our company and PS contract. This is allowing companies such as General Motors to have better visibility and manageability across the printer fleet. In our Industrial businesses, new innovation is enabling production to be more agile and more personalized. In industrial graphics, we are seeing improvements in the market and growth in hardware installations among the customer wins this quarter for the installation of a 100 Indigo Press at CCL, our leader in label security and packaging solutions. We also continue to see consistent double-digit growth in Print impressions and square meters. In 3D, we are creating more vertical go-to-market solutions, spanning equipment software and services across industries from industrial tooling to automotive to health and wellness. For example, our molded fiber tooling solution based on customer engagement and adoption, including numerous prepaid purchases and we enable them to achieve significant process and cost efficiencies. In addition, we are partnering with Ford Motor Company to extend the life of already used 3D printed parts by turning them into auto components for the F250 trucks creating a closed [loop on waste]. With our strong and diverse portfolio, we also continue to generate meaningful free cash flow. And we remain focused on deploying our cash to maximize value creation. We have the flexibility to return significant capital to shareholders and reinvest in our businesses, while also exploring disciplined M&A. We will continue to look for opportunities to strengthen our core, expanding to attractive adjacencies and create additional growth engine. As always, we will take a rigorous approach to evaluating M&A, requiring strategic fit, attractive financial returns that exceed those of buying our own stock and a strong operational plan to execute on the value proposition. And an important enabler of our strategy is continuing to transform the company to become leaner and more digitally enabled. For HP, there is a continued focus on both reducing structural costs and for investing for the future. To help us accelerate our progress, we announced three new leadership appointments. Didier Deltort is joining HP as a President of Personalization and 3D Printing; Greg Baxter, will be our next Chief Transformation Officer; and Kristen Ludgate is joining HP as our Chief People Officer. Working together with our leadership team, they will strengthen our innovation capabilities and help drive our long-term strategy. And our key part of our strategy is to deliver strong results while staying true to HP's values. Last month, we announced an ambitious set of climate action goals. By 2025, we aim to achieve carbon neutrality, zero waste in HP operations and zero deforestation for HP paper and paper-based packaging. We're also committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions across our entire value chain by 2040. And last week, we announced a new set of diversity and inclusion goals. This includes our pledge to achieve 50-50 gender equality in HP leadership by 2030, making us the first Fortune 100 tech company to make such a commitment. I am proud to say our partners are joining us in these efforts. Today, over 1,400 partners have signed the Amplify Impact to set their own long-term objective to drive a sustainable impact. This is where the size and scale of HP's ecosystem truly shines. Overall, I am very pleased with our performance this quarter and excited for what lies ahead. We continue to drive our relentless focus on execution, while taking decisive actions to capitalize on attractive opportunities to advance our leadership in Personal Systems and Print, expand into attractive adjacencies, disrupt new market, and transform the way we operate. And I am confident that our strategy will continue to create significant shareholder value. I know I speak for our more than 50,000 employees, when I say we are not content simply maintaining our current position. We have a much bigger ambition. And with that, I will turn the call over to Marie, who will take you through the details of our quarter and our fiscal year outlook. Marie, over to you. Marie Myers : Thanks, Enrique. HP's second quarter results highlight both our operational strength and the breadth of our portfolio. We are demonstrating our ability to meet customer needs and continuing on our transformation journey all while growing operating profit, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our robust capital returns, while continuing to make investments in the company for our future. Turning to the details of the second quarter. Q2 net revenue was $15.9 billion, up 27% nominally and 25% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas increased 32%, EMEA increased 19%, and APJ increased 23%. The year-on-year growth rate benefited from the prior-year impact of COVID and supply chain disruptions. Demand continued to outpace supply and we ended the quarter with elevated backlog in both Personal Systems and Printing. At the highest since the split, gross margin was 21.7%, up 1.7 points year-on-year. The increase was primarily driven by favorable pricing, including historically low promotion expense and favorable currency, partially offset by higher costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $2 billion or 12.6% of revenue, up 10 basis points year-on-year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by higher variable compensation as a result of the very strong performance this year as compared to Q2 2020, as well as increased investments in innovation and go-to-market. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $64 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased 82% to $0.93, with a diluted share count of approximately 1.2 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes net benefits totaling $70 million, primarily related to other tax adjustments and non-operating retirement related credits, partially offset by restructuring and other charges, as well as amortization of intangible assets. As a result, Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.98. Turning to segment performance. In Q2, Personal Systems benefited from strong demand related to working and learning from home. Revenue was $10.6 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Demand for our product remained very strong with backlog increasing again quarter-on-quarter. Drilling into the details, we saw strength across consumer and commercial with revenue up 72% and 10% respectively. By product category, revenue was up 47% for notebooks, down 8% for desktops, and down 7% for workstations. Strong demand for notebooks drove total unit growth of 44% with Chromebooks representing 20% of our total Personal Systems units as the need for technology and education continued to grow. We also saw solid services attach with particular strength in commercial and significant double-digit growth in consumer peripherals. Personal Systems delivered $710 million in operating profit and operating margins of 6.7%. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to favorable pricing, including lower promotion expenses, as well as currency, partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher cost, including variable compensation, commodity costs, as well as investments in innovation and go-to-market. In Print, our results reflected continued focus on execution and the strength of our portfolio. We are uniquely positioned as leaders in both consumer and commercial and have the hardware supplies and services to deliver value in a hybrid world. Q2 total print revenue was $5.3 billion, up 28% and total hardware units grew 42% to [$10.6 billion]. By customer segment, consumer revenue was up 77% with units up 45% and Commercial revenue and units were up 34% and 22% respectively. In Commercial, the recovery momentum continued with revenue up 13% sequentially, but we continue to expect the recovery to be gradual and uneven at times across segments and geographies. Supplies revenue was $3.3 billion, up 17%. The year-on-year growth was primarily driven by favorable pricing, as well as ongoing consumer demand and improving commercial demand. Our contractual business is a key element of our print strategy in both Consumer and Commercial printing. In Consumer our Instant Ink business continue to resonate well with customers with cumulative enrollees growing 7% sequentially to 9.7 million. On the Commercial side, we drove growth in managed print services revenues, a new TCP bookings for the first time since the pandemic took hold and strong renewal TCP bookings again this quarter. Operating profit increased $403 million to $951 million and operating margins were 17.9%. This year-over-year increase was driven by increased volume and favorable pricing across hardware and supplies, including less promotional expense, partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher costs. Let me now turn to our transformation efforts and specifically our cost savings initiatives. In the second year of our program, we continued to look at new cost savings opportunities and remain ahead of our $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan. During the quarter, we continued our efforts to optimize our factory footprint to enable a best-in-class supply chain network and enhance supply resiliency, while reducing our cost structure. In addition, we continue to enhance and leverage our digital capabilities to transform ways in which we operate and deliver value to our customers. The structural cost savings from our transformation efforts give us the flexibility to reinvest in our business, the long-term growth and profitability. Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Second quarter cash flow from operations and free cash flow were better than expected at $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion respectively. In Q2, the cash conversion cycle was minus 28 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle was up 2 days as growth in inventory primarily due to strategic buys drove increased days of inventories, partially offset by a reduction in days sales outstanding and higher days payable outstanding. For the quarter, we returned a total of $1.8 billion to shareholders, which represented 137% of free cash flow. This included $1.6 billion in share repurchases and $239 million in cash dividends. Looking forward, we expect to continue buying back shares at elevated levels of at least $1 billion per quarter in the coming quarters unless higher return opportunities emerge. Looking forward to the third quarter and the rest of fiscal 2021, we continue to model multiple scenarios related to supply availability, pricing dynamics and the pace of economic reopening. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. From a demand perspective, we expect to continue to see strong demand for our PCs, particularly in consumer. In Print, we expect solid demand in consumer and continued improvement in commercial as offices reopen. While we expect year-on-year revenue growth in FY 2021 to reflect our continued progress on our strategy, it is also important to note the growth trends in Q3 will also reflect the tougher year-over-year comparisons, particularly in Personal Systems. We expect supply constraints to continue to negatively impact our ability to meet demand in PCs and Printers, at least through the end of calendar 2021. We expect gross margin pressure in the second half of the year in both Personal Systems and Print due to increased costs and commodities and logistics as compared to Q2 levels and as we expect to see some more normalization in the market and pricing environment. We expect operating expenses in the second half of the year to be more similar to Q1 run rate. Finally, we continue to closely monitor the current COVID resurgence and its potential impact to our supply chain, particularly in Southeast Asia. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following guidance for Q3 and FY 2021. We expect third quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.85 and third quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.81. We expect FY 2021 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.50 and FY 2021 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.24 to $3.34. For FY 2021, we expect our free cash flow to be at least $4 billion. And now I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I have a few. The first one I guess was hoping if you could talk a little bit about the Print margins in the April quarter. I'm somewhat surprised they were down on a sequential basis by nearly 200 basis points even though the supply mix I think was fairly stable in July versus April. So, could you maybe just touch on what happened to the Print margins in the April quarter, and how do we think about it in the back half of the year? Marie Myers : Sure. No. Thanks, Amit and good afternoon. So the decline we saw in the Print operating rate was really driven by several factors. So first of all, some of the unfavorable cost in commodities, factory, and logistics and secondly by investments that we made in OpEx across R&D, marketing to support future growth and higher variable comp. And look, overall I'd just say we have seen strength and resiliency in our Print portfolio, which really positions us well against the competition. And as we look ahead into the future, we do expect our margins to be in the long-term range of 16% to 18%. And let me give you just a few things to think about as you think about the second half. So, obviously, the full year was very strong in the first half. So, we expect to be toward the higher end of the range. And just a couple of other points I would add is, some of the exceptional benefit that we saw in H1, particularly in favorable pricing will start to diminish. And so, we would expect that our mix as well would normalize as the office reopens. We're likely to see higher commodity cost, logistics costs, and that will potentially impact our ability to meet demand. And then finally, there is some seasonal mix headwinds in Q2 as \u2013 in supplies as Q2 is typically our strongest quarter for supplies. So, just keep that in mind, as you're thinking about the second half, and I'll just conclude that we're in the business of generating incremental OP dollars. Enrique Lores : I think a key point for our performance for Print this quarter is that we are really pleased of how the Print business did. Whether if you look at year-on-year comparison, whether you look at growth, it is really aligned to the trends that we described last quarter, the rebalancing that we see happening between home and office, the growth that we are starting to see in some of the commercial and industrial categories. So Print had a very strong quarter and we expect it to continue through the rest of the year. Amit Daryanani : Got it. That is really helpful. And then if I could just follow-up in comparable dynamic really, Enrique I think a big focus for everyone is trying to understand what does steady state EPS look like for HP over time, especially given the strong performance you've had in the first half, and I think your back half guide sort of implies EPS will decline high-single digits 10% plus in Q3 and Q4. I'm curious, I know you touched on Print, but I\u2019m curious what are the other vectors that are driving the slowdown in EPS, especially given the fact you're elevated backlog? And then do you think the $0.75, $0.80 implied EPS in October quarter is a representation of what normal EPS run rate is going to look like for HP? Enrique Lores : Yes, so first of all, let me talk about the year-on-year comparison how we put things in perspective. EPS for the second half is growing more than 40% from where we were a year ago. So, we're really representing very solid growth. At the same time as you are saying, we continue to see very strong demand across all of our portfolio. We expect this to continue to happen through the second half, but we are going to be limited by supply, given the shortages that we see in the market. And this is a fundamental part of what is driving our guide. As we have done in the past, we are prudent when we guide, we have been in the past and we will continue to be. If we can do better, we will, we could be there better because of better pricing, because we could do better, because of better capacity. So, again prudent guide, we have demonstrated that if we can do better we will do better, and therefore given all the anomalies that we see and this supply constrained, I don't think we should be using the Q4 number to project the business in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I had a question on inventory, both on your balance sheet and then within the channel. Up about $800 million quarter-over-quarter, I'm curious, how much of that was component buying or maybe some end product just given supply chain hiccups? And then Lenovo said today, I think that they see two to three weeks of channel inventory on PCs usually, I can't remember I think it was six to eight weeks is their normal. Can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in the channel and both on the PC and the printer side? And then I've a follow-up. Thank you. Enrique Lores : Let me start and I think maybe before Marie shares some of the numbers, let me share some of the strategy that we have behind it. What we shared last quarter, that we were anticipating some of the supply challenges that we are seeing, we decided to operate with higher levels of HOI and this is what you see reflected in the numbers. So, Marie why don't you give some color on whether the increases we see in HOI? Marie Myers : Yes. No, absolutely, Enrique. So, let me step back and set some context for you Shannon. So obviously, we've seen that strong demand across peers in Print. And as you know, we're also lapping the factory closures and disruptions from those inventory drawdowns last year and obviously that impacted the system all the way through. And then we're obviously trying to continue to navigate the supply chain challenges given the ongoing nature of the pandemic. So, to approve assurance of supply, we are carrying higher levels of owned inventory and as we said, we do this to navigate during this time. So, HOI at this point is likely to stay elevated to support business growth. And that includes strategic buys to answer your question, where, particularly in CPUs. And then going on to the second part of your question around channel inventory, overall CI in PS, Print, hardware and supplies is currently below historical levels. And our backlog is up frankly quarter-on-quarter, and that gives us confidence on the demand that we are seeing Shannon. Shannon Cross : Okay, great. And then just a question on pricing. I think you noted you expect some normalization in pricing, but what we're hearing is prices are somewhat increasing. So, is this more sort of an average price, so mix impact or what are you seeing, because if there is no supply out there and demand remains strong, I don't see where you might not have some pricing pressure, sorry pricing advantage? Thank you. Enrique Lores : Thank you, Shannon. I think it's worth to go through the pricing discussion business by business. In the case of Print, we are having price increases across the board and you can see in our numbers an increase in the average price. In the case of PCs, pricing rates are growing or price in each category are going up, but overall price is going down because of mix, because of where we are seeing the higher demand in the market. So, prices are up, but because of mix, you may see the average price going down. Marie Myers : And Shannon just to add to Enrique's comments, some of the favorable pricing that we saw in the benefit in the first half is starting to abate in the second half as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you for taking the question. I just want to \u2013 just trying to square the circle on a couple of things, particularly around your guidance. So, seasonally you're typically up in EPS and you're guiding for EPS to be down about 10% sequentially. Revenue is typically up 3% or 4%. Are you suggesting that revenue is going to be lower than normal seasonal or is this all margin pressure? And the reason I struggle with the margin question is, it sounds like your backlog is even bigger. You should be able to sell whatever you have. You have incremental inventory so that should allow you to arguably meet demand better. So, if you're in a situation where people are chasing demand and the mix doesn't fundamentally change, why do you expect pricing to abate? So, I guess a couple of questions in there. One, do you expect an impact to top line that's different from normal seasonal? Or is it all margin in terms of your way below normal seasonal EPS guidance? And then how do we square that margin pressure with the fact that there is really strong demand, you have better inventory to fulfill that demand and you should be able to continue to take price? Marie Myers : Hey, Toni, good afternoon. It's Marie. So, let me walk you through how to think about our guide and specifically. I'll give you a sense of what the headwinds and the tailwinds are looking like. So, first of all, with respect to your comments on revenue, we do expect that revenue will be driven more by available supply than demand and there are increasing margin headwinds versus the first half. With all that said, as Enrique said right at the onset of the call, we are guiding for double-digit operating profit and EPS growth in Q3. And frankly, we believe that this is a prudent guide in the context of the current environment. Obviously, if we can do better, we always will. But let me walk you through what we're seeing from the headwinds and tailwinds to give you some of that color. So on the headwinds, we are seeing component costs and logistics costs in both PS and Print, and they will be an incremental headwind both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, and those overall basket of commodities, particularly in panel, ICs and PS and then ICs and resins in Print. And then there are the tailwinds that we've had in the first half around those favorable pricing dynamics. They will start to dissipate as we lap the onset of those historically low promotion expenses. And getting into your comments on tailwinds and how we're thinking about it, demand in both PS and Print continue obviously to be very strong as you mentioned. We're seeing those trends of hybrid work continue, but obviously they are constrained by supply. So, you know, and in addition, just to, kind of wrap up here, as we said, we're going to continue to return capital to shareholders. So, we expect that that [repo of] at least about $1 billion a quarter. So for the full-year, we expect PS margins will be slightly above the high end of our longer-term range of 3.5% to 5.5% and Print for the full-year at the higher end of 16% to 18%. So, at this point, we remain very confident of our guide and if we can do better like I said, we will. Enrique Lores : And I think Toni, something important to having consideration this year, is that really the business and the market is driven by supply, not by demand. So therefore comparing this year with other years based on seasonality, it will not work, because really the dynamics behind the market are very different. What we continue to see is very strong demand across our portfolio and this is really the key driver is how much supply we can get. Toni Sacconaghi : If I could just follow-up on the pricing dynamics, so, if I look at consumer print ASPs last quarter were up 30%, this quarter were up 27%. If we went to something like zero pricing, it would basically put your operating margins dramatically down in the IPG group. So, I want to understand what is driving this pricing? So, is this purely an absence of discounting? Is this a \u2013 we're not building lower end SKUs with lower margin and we're forcing people to take sort of more richly configured consumer printers that have better margin or is it we're actually raising price because we can, because demand is constrained. But obviously 27% ASP growth this quarter, 30% last quarter is helping your economics enormously. As you suggested, it's going to be less, but I want to understand very specifically what is driving that ASP increase? Enrique Lores : I think Toni we, in a situation like the one we are facing, we are doing anything we can to optimize our business and therefore we are guiding all the actions that you were mentioning. We of course have reduced significantly our promotional discounts, because of how strong the demand is. We are still in demand toward higher margin products and of course, in the cases where we can, also our prices are going up because as we said before, we are seeing \u2013 we are living in an inflationary environment and whenever we can we will \u2013 we have increased prices. Operator : Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. I heard you mentioned that PC backlog is up sequentially. Is your Print backlog also up versus the first quarter? And then, can you talk about how the makeup of backlog is changing as you go through the year? Is there any shift from consumer to commercial from Chromebook to other PCs and just mix between hardware and supplies? And then I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Let me take that question. Hi, Katy. So, the answer to the first question is, yes. We are seeing an increase in backlog across both PCs and Printers. And in terms of how do we expect this to evolve, is really aligned to where do we see demand coming during the next quarters. As we mentioned before, we expect through the end of the year, an increase in the demand on the commercial side, both on the PC side and also on the Print side, and this is where \u2013 because of that, backlog will be moving into this direction. But still we continue to see strong demand on consumer as I mentioned before. Katy Huberty : Great, thank you. And then PC margins this quarter were a bit lower than the flat sequential guidance. What were the surprises on costs or mix in the quarter? And then should we expect with cost inflation that PC margins return to that roughly 5% range from a couple of years ago? Marie Myers : Yes, Katy, it's Marie. Hey, good afternoon. So, let me hit up your margin question. So yes, the margins were strong again at 6.7%, which as you know is above the high end of our long-term range and some of that was obviously driven by that strong pricing discipline that we've spoken about, as well as some benefit from currency, but really it was offset by mix and some of those commodity headwinds. And as we get into the full-year, we do expect that margins to be slightly above the high-end of our range of 3.5% to 5.5% and it's going to be driven by the themes that you're hearing today, particularly around those continued shortages in commodities and that's obviously sort of transforming into higher component costs and then knock on cost and logistics. And then I'd finally just add, we are starting to enter a period where the impact of favorable pricing is going to start to diminish as we start to lap that period in time. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Tim Long : Thank you. Yes, two if I could. First on the Print side, could you talk a little bit about, you mentioned some of the user numbers for the as-a-service offering both for consumer and commercial. It seems like it's, you know pretty steady growth here. Could you talk a little bit about some of the underlying drivers beyond that, maybe usage or anything else that's potentially showing the strength there other than just the user base? And then second, if \u2013 you talked about another quarter of very strong Chromebook, could you just talk a little bit about the impacts there on the model margin ASP? And then also as you expect to see a little bit of normalization to PC growth. Is the expectation that the rapid growth in Chromebook will be something that will pull back or do you think that's something that could start replacing other mid and lower tiers of the of the PC segment? Thank you. Enrique Lores : Many questions in one question. I will try to go one by one. So, starting from Print, for the dynamics we are seeing are very similar to what we explained a quarter ago and the evolution is what we were expecting. Before to pre-pandemic levels, we continue to see our home business to perform better than what we were projecting. And this is driving the demand that we see both on-premise and also on supplies. And on the office side, we have seen the opposite effect. As many offices are still closed and people are not going back to the office, the overall office business continues to be below where it was before the pandemic. Through the end of the year, we expect the situation to reverse as offices will reopen, we expect our office business to perform better and at the same time more people will be \u2013 less people will be working from home, we expect that it will have also an impact, a negative impact on our home business. So, a similar trend to what we expected in [Puerto Rico]. In terms of demand on the Chromebook side, we continue to see very strong demand from education. We have \u2013 this is what is driving the growth of Chromebooks and this is what also when we were talking before about the ASPs on the PC side and the mix there, this is what we have in some of the impact in the pricing on the PC side, because Chromebooks overall have lower prices than the rest of the PC portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on another solid quarter. First question I have a follow-up is, when we look at the results of the commercial business starting to recover, I think you reported 10% growth. I think your peer reported growth around that tonight. So, I'm curious of how you're thinking about the back-to-work, back to office trend on the commercial PC side, any thoughts on kind of the installed base, the age of the installed base, just how you think that demand shapes up through the course of the year? Enrique Lores : Sure. So again, similar to what we shared a quarter ago, we expect the demand on the commercial side to start to recover and we are starting to see some recovery as you are saying. What we are seeing from our clients is that they are realizing of the need to invest in better equipment for their officers when employees come back and this is really going to be helping both the Print and the PC business as you were mentioning. In terms of dynamics, we continue to see our shift from desktops into notebooks, because even if employees will be going back to their office, we still see the need for companies to offer a hybrid way of working and enabling their employees to work-from-home and therefore, we expect the shift mix from desktops into notebooks to continue. We have talked in the past, overall has a positive impact for the business because of both pricing but also because of the recycle times at PC that notebook has compared to the desktop. Aaron Rakers : Yes. And then as a quick follow-up, just on the free cash flow, I think you've stuck with the 4 billion free cash flow or at least 4 billion for this year. You're raising EPS. I'm just trying to maybe understand why free cash flow wouldn't be stronger and trending higher with the EPS? Marie Myers : Yes, sure. Aaron. Let me go ahead and hit that one up for you. So look, regarding future free cash flow, as you know, this is always driven by our strong net earnings. What we're thinking is that our working capital is going to be a headwind due to some of the decisions we're making to carry more inventory. So look for 2021, we continue to remain confident obviously in our outlook and confident in our guide of at least $4 billion in free cash flow. Enrique Lores : And I think, let me add one more comment. We are really pleased with the progress we have made in free cash flow in Q1 and Q2. The guide that we have provided is of at least $4 billion for the year and as Marie just mentioned, we are really expecting to be at that level. Operator : Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : Hey, thanks guys for taking the question. Congrats on the strong results. Two quick ones, if I could. Enrique, based on conversations with corporate customers and given the backlog, do you get the sense that this momentum will actually continue into calendar 2022. Would love to get any updated context there? And then I just have a quick follow-up. Thanks. Enrique Lores : Thank you for the question. And we think that the changes that we have seen driven by the pandemic are going to be permanent and are going to continue to have an impact in 2021 and 2022. More and more people will have \u2013 will be working in a hybrid way. We think that [marquees] will continue to learn from government from the time from school and this is going to continue to have a positive impact on the overall size of the PC market. And therefore, we expect the size of the market to continue to be significantly larger than what we were expecting before the pandemic. Additionally to that as we just described, we also expect to see strong commercial demand through the end of the year. So, this will also help and put even more \u2013 drive even more growth on the PC side. Ananda Baruah : And just sticking there, just going back to the questions about mix on the PC side, you talked about strengthening Chromebook and how that, you know as having a, sort of software mix impact on ASCs. Would that not reverse as commercial, so it doesn't \u2013 continue to open up, should we not expect that to reverse and carry sort of into 2022 the mix? Enrique Lores : So, in terms of mix, yes, we expect the mix of commercial to go up during the next quarter. And this is why Marie was mentioning before that we expect overall operating profit of Personal Systems to be slightly higher than our guided range through the end of the year. Ananda Baruah : That's great, thanks so much. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Matt Cabral : Yes, thank you. On the Print side, I was wondering if you give us an update on where you stand in trying to refill some of the supplies channel inventory? Just talk about how big of a factor that was in the quarter and how we should think about the contribution from here? And maybe more broadly just an update on your efforts to add visibility as we start thinking about getting below those Tier 1 and Tier 2 distributors that you have out there? Marie Myers : Yes, no, sure, Matt. So, maybe I'll just start it with a quick comment on where we see the channel right now relative to supplies and I think I mentioned earlier that overall our channel inventory levels for the company are sort of below historic levels. And that includes supplies and obviously we continue to monitor that very carefully, so that we can maintain a healthy and appropriate levels. But this quarter given \u2013 if you wind it back a year ago, we had the sort of the onset of the pandemic, so we've had that channel depletion that occurred last year. And so we did see some benefit in the year-on-year compare. And from that impact of the inventory movements, we estimate that to be approximately 3% year-on-year. And as you know, we have a multi-tiered channel. So, this is our best estimate based on the data we have including our channels for product across our channel and end user stock. Matt Cabral : That's helpful. And then I think it was last week that you guys announced the new head of your 3D printing business. Maybe just a broader update on how 3D has been ramping? Where you guys stand with the push and just maybe a bigger picture on when we should start to thinking about some more explicit disclosure, just to think about the impact of that business more going forward? Enrique Lores : Sure. Let me take that one. So first of all, this quarter, we started to see or we have seen the previous one solid growth on the 3D side. Perhaps grew more than 30%, which is a very solid number. And I think these showed some of the potential that this business has in the long-term. As we had announced before, we are complementing our strategy on 3D to also focus on some end-to-end applications where we think we're going to get even more value than just by selling printers or consumables and we were mentioning on our prepared remarks, the work that we are doing a molded fiber as an example. But we really think that more and more, we will have, we will be focusing on applications to capture value in this business and this is why we selected Didier Deltort to lead this business. He comes from the health and wellness industry. So, he comes from an industry that will be disrupted by 3D and we think this will be adding significant value to the definition of our strategy. And then in terms of when we will be more transparent on the 3D business, I think as I've said before, there are two major things. One is, we want the business to have higher scale and second, and probably most important, we need to have a better defined business model. And this is where this combination of selling printers or supplies or going after end-to-end applications is so important. So, while we will have a complete perspective of where this will be going longer-term is when we will be providing more visibility. Operator : Our final question today comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Jeff Rand : Hi, this is Jeff Rand on for Sidney. Can you give us an update on the competitive environment in your Personal Systems business and how this has changed through the pandemic and now a tight supply environment? Enrique Lores : Yes, I think that first of all, as we have discussed before, really the performance of this business now is more driven by supply than by the strength of the portfolio. Now having said that, we are really pleased with the progress we have made from a portfolio perspective. If you look at the innovation that we have introduced this quarter, we won significant awards across both consumer and commercial products. We have one of the broadest portfolios in the market, covering from low-end education products to high-end commercial products and we are in a very solid position to continue to grow share as we did this quarter that shows really the relevance of our portfolio. Jeff Rand : Great and just my follow-up, how should we think about your operating expenses trending in the near term as cost like business travel start to return? Enrique Lores : Well, I think if you look at the projections that we have for the second half, we think we will be going back to a similar level to where we were in Q1. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Enrique Lores for any closing remarks. Enrique Lores : Okay. So, let me close and thank you everybody for having joined us today. I think the strong results of the quarter demonstrate the relevance of HP in this hybrid world and how our technology is going to be helping customers to really perform in a very different environment. We are really pleased with the growth opportunities that we see both in our core markets, in attractive adjacencies and also in the new segments that we are creating. And we are going to continue to innovate across our technology to continue to create and drive differentiation. Thank you for your time today and looking forward to meet in person sometime soon. Thank you. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. I hope that you and your families are safe and well. It's an important time for us to connect. The hybrid world taking shape is expanding our addressable market and creating new opportunities to drive profitable growth. We have already started to capitalize on this and have a long runway ahead. This is evident in our Q3 performance. We delivered another quarter of top and bottom-line growth with EPS growing substantially faster than revenue. This reflects continued progress against our strategic priorities and strong and sustained demand for our products and services. In Q3, we delivered revenue of $15.3 billion, an increase of 7%. Our non-GAAP net earnings increased 71% to $1.2 billion. Non - GAAP EPS increased to $1 compared to $0.49 in Q3 last year. And we generated $1 billion of free cash flow, returning $1.7 billion to shareholders. Before I take you through the highlights, I want to first share three key points of context as you think about our performance and outlook. First, as I mentioned, we continue to see strong demand for our products and services. The hybrid world is accelerating trends in our segments and our leadership across commercial and consumer categories positioned as well, even as demand continues to outpace supply. The second point is that we continue to ship as much products as we can while navigating a complex operational environment. We are managing through component shortages, COVID-related factory lockdowns in Southeast Asia, and congested ports, and transportation disruptions. Even under these conditions, we delivered solid financial results. And third, we are performing while transforming our business models and service offerings to capitalize on emerging growth opportunities. We have continued to make progress, reducing our fixed cost structure, evolving our business model, and creating new growth businesses. And we are expanding our time in key segments to drive additional top and bottom-line growth. In Personal Systems, we will be driven by our focus on peripherals and new computing models. In Printing, we are expanding our services and subscription offerings. I will talk about all of these in more detail by looking at the progress we're making across our portfolio. In Personal Systems, demand for our products continued to be strong with our backlog increasing again quarter-on-quarter. PC penetration rates are growing across our markets, as devices become increasingly essential in today's hybrid world. While we delivered strong operating profit, PS revenue was less than we expected primarily because of our supply chain constraint. We expect industry-wide supply shortages, particularly in ICs, to continue into 2022. Given these, we have identified the necessary improvements we need to make and at accelerating that execution to drive stronger top-line performance. We expect that it will take more than one quarter to show results. As we ramp supply, our PS portfolio is extremely well-positioned for the hybrid world, and we see significant opportunities for market expansion. And our leading share in commercial PCs position us well as more businesses reopen. In the commercial market, we launched a new all-in-one and expanded our ZBook portfolio of high-performance PCs for Creative Professionals. This includes the ZBook Studio G8, the world's most powerful mobile workstation of its size. And our new civil power brings ZBook performance to students, SMB, and the public sector. In Q3, we also launched a new Pavilion line-up that brings premium computing experiences into the mainstream with a series of new displays that are purpose-built for home-office and entertainment setup. And we continued to drive momentum outside of our core hardware businesses. This quarter, we completed our acquisition of HyperX, giving us a leading position in gaming peripherals and a platform from which to accelerate our peripheral leadership more broadly. We also continue to advance our device as a service business, which grew 32% in the quarter. And we are investing to meet emerging customer needs in the commercial space. This is highlighted by our recent agreement to acquire Teradici Corporation. Teradici Software is widely used by leading organizations around the world to deliver superior remote computing solutions. We expect this deal will accelerate new computer models and services tailored for hybrid work environment. In Printing, revenue was up 24% driven by recovery in commercial and strength in consumer. As in Personal Systems, the rise of all things hybrid plays to our strengths and is creating new opportunities for print innovation and growth. Specifically, we are expanding our services and subscription offerings, each of which delivered double-digit growth this quarter. We continued to sell HP+ and Instant Ink across North America and Europe, including the addition of HP+ on the Envy and DeskJet product family. We have seen positive response to HP+ to date. And HP's Instant Ink hit a major milestone by surpassing 10 million subscribers. Our subscription services are providing a simple and seamless experience for today's hybrid workers, paving the way for new offerings in the future. We also continued to evolve our hardware portfolio with success in our award-winning HP LaserJet 400 and 500 Series. HP continues to be recognized as a Best Managed Print vendor, helping SMB solution providers thrive in a competitive market where quality and security are essential. The strength of our position in the commercial market is significant as more people return to the office. In our industrial businesses, we drove very strong hardware revenue growth in the quarter. Importantly, our number of pages printed is at or above 2019 levels. We once again saw double-digit growth in print impressions and square meters, as well as strength in key categories like labels and packaging. And in 3D, we remain focused on driving high-value end-to-end applications in strategic vertical markets. This quarter, we launched the new Arize Orthotic Solution. It leverages HP 3D printing and cloud-based software to help the millions of patients who suffer from foot pain. It is a great example of the opportunity we see to develop industries with highly personalized solutions. Our combination of innovation and execution enables us to continue making progress across our business and portfolio. And we remain committed to generating strong cash flow and to value-creating capital allocation. This includes our robust share repurchase and dividend program and disciplined organic and inorganic investments. In Q3, we returned $1.7 billion to shareholders and have returned $6.8 billion over the past 12 months. We believe our shares remain undervalued and are committed to aggressive repurchase levels of at least $1.5 billion in Q4. As part of our value creation strategy, we also remain focused on M&A that can accelerate our growth in strategic areas. HyperX and Teradici are two great examples. We will continue using our rigorous returns-based framework to evaluate and pursue deals that complement our strategy and accelerate new sources of value creation. As we drive our portfolio strategy and transformation agenda, we continue to prioritize making a sustainable impact. This quarter, we released our 20th Annual Sustainable Impact report that highlights the work we are doing in climate action, human rights, and digital equity, and outlined new 2030 goals. Not only is this the right thing to do, it's also driving business success. In 2020, our Sustainable Impact Initiative helped us win more than $1 billion in new sales for the second consecutive year. Aligned with this, we recently issued $1 billion in sustainability bonds. We are allocating these proceeds to ESG related initiatives consistent with our strategy and values. Looking ahead to Q4, our backlog remains significantly elevated. We expect robust demand to continue, and we are taking decisive steps to address operational headwinds. Our portfolio is strong and resilient, and we remain on track to significantly exceed the full-year EPS target we set in February. And today, we are raising our Q4 outlook. And more importantly, we plan to build on this performance and expect to grow full-year EPS in fiscal year '22. Longer-term, the hybrid world plays to our strength and creates attractive opportunities across our categories. We are well-positioned to drive sustained performance but we innovate, improve, and continue to reinvent for our customers, partners, and shareholders. I look forward to our upcoming October analyst meeting to discuss our strategy and our plans to drive continued business success. Let me now turn the call over to Marie, who will take you through the details of the quarter and our fiscal year outlook. Marie, over to you. Marie Myers : Thanks, Enrique. Looking at our third-quarter financial results, we delivered another solid quarter of revenue growth with Operating Profit and EPS growing substantially faster. We are continuing our transformation journey while generating strong free cash flow, returning significant capital to shareholders, and investing for long-term value creation. Looking at the details of Q3, net revenue was $15.3 billion, up 7% nominally and 4% in constant currency. Regionally in constant currency, America has increased 12%, EMEA increased 1%, and APJ declined 6%. Supply chain constraints affected both Print and Personal Systems revenue. And this was particularly impactful in EMEA and APJ in Personal Systems. Across Personal Systems and Print, we continued to see strong demand for our products and solutions, capitalizing on opportunities we see as the hybrid world takes shape. The gross margin was 22.2% up 5.5 points year on year. The increase was primarily driven by continued favorable pricing, including lower promotions, as well as a reduction to previously estimated sales and marketing [Indiscernible] incentives, as well as currency partially offset by higher costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion, or 12.4% of revenue. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased investments in go-to-market and innovation, as well as higher variable compensation due to the very strong performance this fiscal year as compared to 2020. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $78 million for the quarter. Non - GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased from $0.51 to $1, including $0.25 related to the reduction in previously estimated incentives of which $0.12 were reinvested during the quarter, primarily at accelerating R&D, incremental marketing, and our hybrid work strategy. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share exclude net expense totaling $90 million, primarily related to restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges, debt extinguishment costs, other tax adjustments, partially offset by non-operating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q3 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.92. Before I get into the details of the segments, let me briefly address the reduction in previously estimated sales and marketing program incentives. Consistent with our policies, we review these estimates every quarter. We estimate incentives based on a number of factors like historical experience, customer behavior, and market conditions. The change in estimate is a result of lower-than-expected incentives due to increased supply constraints, shifts in customer behavior, and the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, it became clear that we had to make an unusually large change in estimate in Q3. Now let me turn to segment performance. In Q3, Personal Systems revenue was $10.4 billion flat year-over-year as supply chain challenges continued to constrain our growth. Demand for our products remains strong with backlog increasing again sequentially, despite substantially clearing the Chrome backlog. Drilling into the details, Consumer and Commercial revenue was up 3% and down 1% respectively. By product category, revenue was flat for notebooks, up 1% for desktops, and down 9% for workstations. Total units were flat year-over-year. We also drove double-digit growth in both consumer peripherals and services attach across consumer and commercial. Personal Systems delivered $869 million and operating profit and operating margins of 8.4%. The operating margin improved by 2.9 points primarily due to favorable pricing, including the reduction in estimated incentives and currency partially offset by higher costs, including commodity costs, investments in innovation, and go-to-market, and variable compensation. In Print, our results reflected a continued focus on execution and the strength of our portfolio. We are uniquely positioned as leaders in both Consumer and Commercial and had the hardware, supply, and services to deliver value in a hybrid world. Q3 total Print revenue was $4.9 billion, up 24% driven by strong growth in supply, hardware, and services. Total hardware units declined 4% due to manufacturing and component constraints, primarily in consumer printers. We expect these Q3 constraints to impact Q4 as well. Our customer segment consumer revenue was up 15% with units down 8% and commercial revenue and units were up 46% and 29%, respectively. Consumer demand remained strong. However, revenue, particularly A4 Laser, was constrained by supply and factory disruptions. The commercial recovery continued with a double-digit hardware revenue growth in office, and triple-digit increases in industrial printing hardware. Given what we're seeing with the Delta variant and evolving hybrid models, we still expect the recovery to be gradual and uneven at times across segments and geographies. Supplies revenue was $3.1 billion. The 20% year-on-year growth was driven by inventory replenishment, stronger commercial demand, and favorable pricing. Our contractual business is a key element of our Print strategy in both consumer and commercial printing. In consumer, our Instant Ink business model continued to resonate well with customers with strong double-digit revenue and subscriber growth. On the commercial side, we drove growth in managed Print Services revenue and total contract value with particular strength in new TCP bookings. Print operating profit increased $377 million to $857 million, and operating margins were 17.6%. Operating margin grew 5.4 points, driven primarily by favorable pricing, including the reduction in estimated incentives, higher volumes in commercial hardware, including graphics and 3D, partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher costs, including commodity costs, investments and innovation, and go-to-market, and variable compensation. Let me now turn to our transformation efforts and our cost savings initiatives. In the second year of our program, we continue to look at new cost savings opportunities and remain ahead of our $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan. Our hybrid work strategy is one example. It has enabled us to accelerate our location strategy while providing a more flexible workspace. Going forward, we are enabling HP's hybrid work strategy by monetizing our sites to be critical hubs for collaboration and innovation. This will also deliver savings to our real estate portfolio. In addition to our progress on our location strategy, we're making progress in our digital transformation. We are enhancing and leveraging our digital capabilities to transform the ways we operate and deliver value to our customers. In the third quarter, we completed the initial deployment of our SAP S/4Hana System, one of the largest ERP implementations. Also, as part of our end-to-end business planning and forecasting efforts, we also went live with our new cloud-based platform, which we believe will improve our forecasting agility as part of our digital transformation. The structural cost savings from those transformation efforts are a key enabler of re-investing in our business for long-term growth and profitability. Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation, third-quarter cash flow from operations and free cash flow were $1.1 billion and $1 billion respectively. In Q3, the cash conversion cycle was minus 29 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle improved one day as higher days payable outstanding more than offset the increased days of inventory due to growth in inventory across PS and Print, and the one-day increase in days sales outstanding. For the quarter, we returned a total of $1.7 billion to shareholders, which represented 178% of free cash flow. This included $1.5 billion in share repurchase and $230 million in cash dividends. Looking forward, we expect to continue to aggressively buy back shares at elevated levels of at least $1.5 billion in Q4. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we continue to navigate supply availability and logistics constraints, pricing dynamics, and the pace of economic reopening. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. For Personal Systems, we continue to see strong demand for our PCs, particularly in Commercial. In Print, we expect solid demand in consumers, and a mix shift as Commercial continues to improve. For both Personal Systems and Print, we expect that component shortage, as well as some manufacturing port and transit disruptions, will continue to constrain revenue due to the ongoing pandemic and resurgence driven by the Delta variant. Taking these considerations into account, we are increasing our Q4 and FY'21 EPS. We expect fourth-quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.90 and fourth quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.88. We expect full-year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.69 to $3.75. And FY'21 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.56 to $3.62. For FY'21, we expect our free cash flow to be at least $4 billion. And now, I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Matt Cabral : Yes, thank you very much. I wanted to start off on the PC side. It's a really strong operating margin, especially relative to just how you were talking about that business 90 days ago. It sounds like a lot of that was the reduction in estimated incentives. Curious if there's any way to quantify that impact, and just if there are any other swing factors to call out. And then going forward, just curious for your perspective on the sustainability of margin data above the longer-term range versus the need for some normalization beyond that point. Marie Myers : Hey, Matt, good afternoon, and thanks for the opportunity. Why don't I heap -- unpack your question? I'll start on the outlook for PS for Q4, and then I'll flip over and give you an update on the change in estimated incentive impact on margin. So, with respect to our PS rate outlook, we have strong confidence in our Q4 operating profit and margin outlook. So far to date, we're really pleased with our PS operating margins to date, and overall, we expect that PS will be well above our long-term range of 3.5% to 5.5% in Q4. So, think about it in terms of being similar to half-one levels, and we'll talk more about that when we get to Sam. Now to address your question with respect to the change in incentive, in terms of the impact on PS margin with respect to OP quarter-on-quarter, the net impact of the reduction in the previously estimated sales and marketing incentive was approximately about a point and a half. And we're talking about that net of investments. And I'll turn it to Enrique now. Enrique Lores : Thank you, Marie. Let me address your question about sustainability. I think a very important thing to understand about this quarter is the strength of the demand that we are seeing. Demand continues to be significantly stronger than our supply chain capacity, backlog grew quarter-over-quarter, and this is really driven by the trends that we have been describing before. The hybrid world is opening and driving opportunities for us to continue to sell PCs. There is a very strong demand for PC for people working from home, and we expect that to continue. So, as we saw strong demand in Q4 -- in Q3, we expect to see strong demand in Q4 and to continue through 2022. Matt Cabral : Perfect. And then maybe building on that last answer, Enrique, you mentioned confidence in EPS growth next year. I'm sure we'll hear a lot more at Sam, but just curious if you can give us a preview of the biggest drivers underneath there? And just how dependent it is on that sustainability of demand or your revenue trajectory versus maybe other levers you have to pull? Enrique Lores : So, we continue to see a lot of opportunities across the Company, both in PC, in Printing, in the new businesses we are creating. And as you said, we will be having our Investor Day in a few weeks from now, and we will be setting all the details about next year at that point. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. Can I just ask one question and that's kind of on the PC side? There's a lot of investor questions about the peaking of the PC cycle and what we're starting to see post the big boost on year-over-year a year ago, big sales. Can you give us some color about your orders, your outlook? It sounds like there is a hand-off going on from consumer to enterprise-strength if I heard you correctly, and therefore probably less strength in Chromebooks. Am I getting that right? And the installed base has been healthily way above 300 million units per year on this run rate. Do you think we're going to stay up there or go down quite a bit? That's the big debate. Thank you so much. Enrique Lores : Let me try to go one by one. First of all, like I was mentioning before, during the quarter, we continued to see very strong demand for PCs driven by the trends that I described. What we saw was that when we finish the quarter, our backlog order that we had that one customer wanted us to ship was significantly larger than what it was at the beginning of a quarter. And what we saw is very strong demand from both commercial and consumer categories. In both cases, we saw increase of demand. The area you were mentioning where we saw some weakness was on the Chromebook space, because many, and it was mostly in the U.S. because many school districts decided to stop their purchase activities until they had clarity on what type of new funds they were going to be getting from the federal government and the timing of those funds. But now, this has been clarified, we expect that now demand on the education space on Chromebooks will pick up at the end of this quarter or at the beginning of next quarter. But in any case, very strong demand on the PC side, faster growth from the commercial, but very strong growth from the consumer. Operator : The next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. Thank you. I also wanted to just follow up on PCs. With the question being, why do you appear to be facing supply and logistic constraints that are significantly more pronounced than your competitors? Dell just reported PC growth of 27%, yours was 0, Lenovo had very strong growth. HP had been a perennial share gainer, and I think it's lost share in PCs. Three out of the last five quarters, or four out of the last five quarters. Why are these constraints so unique to HP? And then related to that, you express confidence in the backlog, but the Chromebook backlog was enormous, 1 or 2 quarters ago, and it's completely gone. And so, what makes the certainty of your conviction in the sustainability of your backlog in PCs for commercial and consumers different from Chromebook? Enrique Lores : Hi Tony. Let me also go one by one. On the PC side, what we saw is, we clearly have some areas where we need to improve operationally to be able to optimize our performance given the delta between supply and demand. And there are 3 areas where specifically we need to -- we are working and we need to do some more work. First of all, as you know, we have an outsourced model, where the majority of our production is managed by ODM. This means that those ODMs we were managing until now, the relationship with the providers of the components that we are missing. We have been thinking that signing now direct relationship and direct supply agreements with them, so this is addressing that gap. Second, the important factor is one of the key things of our PC business is the breadth of our portfolio. We lead both in consumer and commercial. But this portfolio has not been designed to optimize for a low-cost component which is what we are missing now. We have been changing that, and as you will -- as we will introduce our new progress going forward, you will see an increase of leverage of components across multiple products, so we can really optimize our digitalization of components. And third, as Marie mentioned during the prepared remarks, we have been working to deploy a new ERP system, that the ERP system is now in place, and now we have the ability to create tools that will help us to optimize the allocation of orders, not only based on business priorities, but also on components availability. And this is something that until now because we were in the middle of the ERP team, we had to do it manually. When I look at all these three areas, explain kind of the improvement that you are going to see on this site and give us confidence on how we will continue to optimize our -- how we manage the current situation. Then the second part of your question around Chromebooks, I think that an important factor to realize is that during the quarter, we closed the backlog because the shipments of Chromebooks were 100% higher than shipments that we made before. When we look at the backlog that is left, we analyze it customer-by-customer, retailer-by-retailer, partner-by-partner, and this gives us very strong confidence on the value and the solidity of that backlog. If we will look at cancellations, with the exception of Chromebook coming from some of the changes in the U.S. school district, we are not seeing cancellations of the backlog, and as we mentioned before, it is more than one full quarter of demands, what we have in backlog. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. Just my final question is, you did say you were going to grow revenues in fiscal '22, you did not say you were going to grow revenues in fiscal '22. Are you confident you will grow revenues in fiscal '22? Enrique Lores : As I said before, we're going to be having our Investor Day in a few weeks from now, and that will be the right time to have all the conversations about fiscal year '22. Thank you, Toni. Operator : The next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I have 2 as well, I guess. The first one, Enrique, maybe you can talk about the Print business a little bit. It continues to perform really well; I think supplies were up 19%, 20%. I think the struggle that everyone is having though is what does profit normalization look like as supplies growth starts to moderate back to the long-term averages. So, I'd love to understand, do you think there are structural changes in place within supplies, within Print actually, that ensure that even if supply starts to slow down, you can sustain the high-teens margins you've been seeing over the last few quarters. Enrique Lores : Thank you. So first of all, in terms of the supply\u2019s performance, we are really pleased with the performance that we saw this quarter. Though we need to accept that the 20% growth is also coming because we had an easy comparison to last year. But again, we are pleased with the performance of our supplies. In terms of what do we see happening, basically, the trends that we shared before. As offices are reopening, we are starting to see an increase in growth on the toner side, on the office side, and at the same time, we are starting to see sunlight slow down on the consumer side, which again, was what we were expecting. And in any case, the consumer business today continues to be above the projections that we had for this time before the pandemic started. And this is a structural change that has happened. Additionally, that, we have been able to accelerate the transition of our business model both rebalance in profitability, but also significantly growing our subscription businesses. And this gives us strong confidence about the evolution of the business going forward, but also in terms of protecting our supply shares because more and more customers are part of a subscription program, we will make sure that they continue to use HP supplies. Marie Myers : To add to Enrique's comments there, right now, our channel is where we want it to be. So, going into Q4, we're not expecting any channel replenishment at this stage either, Amit. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you very much. And then, Marie, maybe a follow-up with you. On the free cash flow dynamics on your Inventory Day, you talked on that a little bit, a bit of a wide ramped up so much. How do you see that normalizing back into the October quarter? Does it normalize in October? Does it stay elevated, I guess longer-term? And what do you need to see as a Company to take in leverage back up to, I think, two times debt-to-EBITDA that you talked about a year ago or so to exclude the bilateral products? Marie Myers : Yes. Look, no worries. I mean, and I think I got the first part of your question. I'll address your comments on inventory. And quite rightly, so you said that inventory is elevated this quarter, and that's really due to strategic assurance of supply. Look, we expect that it's frankly going to remain higher than pre-COVID levels. But look, we might see some adjustments quarter-on-quarter as we drive and meet customers' needs. We're in a pretty dynamic environment as we speak here. Now to address the second part of your question on leverage, right now, our gross debt to EBITDA is about 1.17, which is -- it's below our stated goal of getting towards 1.5 to 2. And look, we continue -- we expect to reach that lower end of the range over time, but right now, given our strong earnings and free cash flow performance, it's going to be a couple of quarters. But I might just add that we are really proud of the job that we've done around capital allocation. I think you heard in my prepared remarks that we said we plan to purchase back at least $1.5 billion in shares in the quarter. Enrique, I might just turn it over to you for any closing comments. Enrique Lores : Well, maybe a couple of comments. I think it's important to remember that we are really -- and we stay very committed to aggressively return capital to our shareholders and our actions during the last quarter reflect that. As we mentioned, we have returned this quarter $1.7 billion to shareholders. which is 178% of free cash flow and since the value plan started, we have bought 20% of our outstanding shares. So, a really strong commitment to that. We, during Q4, are going to be buying at least $1.5 billion, so we are continuing with that. And during The Analyst Day, we will share what our plans for '22 are. But you can expect from our very strong focus on continue buying back and dividends. Operator : The next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Yes. Thank you. Marie, can you help us understand what the catalyst was to change the sales and marketing incentives in the quarter because that was a big surprise, and at face value, it almost looks like it was a reaction to operational execution and shortfalls, but maybe that wasn't the case. And specifically, is this an accrual change, or is it an actual change in the level of payments that you were making in the quarter? And should we think about this new level as a new structural level, or will this recover as you come out of COVID? And then I have a follow-up. Marie Myers : Yes. Good afternoon, Katy. So why don't I explain to you -- just walk you through this change in estimates, then I'll address your question specifically around the accrual and the reserves. So, we typically look at these estimates every quarter. So, we estimate our sales and marketing incentives based on a number of different factors. So, for example, historical experience, expected customer behavior, acceptance rates, and a very important driver is market conditions, which as you know, we've experienced a lot of volatility since the COVID-19 pandemic began. It's also worth noting that some of these programs take several months, from 6 months to 12 months for partners to claim. With the impact of these market dynamics combined with the lower claims that we've seen from our partners, it became clear that we had to make this unusually large change in estimate in Q3. And frankly, we don't expect future changes of this size. But if it changes, we'll make the appropriate disclosures. Now, typically reserves, just to answer your question, you asked me about the reserve, and then I'll address your structural components. Reserves are typically liabilities for estimated future payments. A reserve can occur for a variety of reasons, one of those can actually be a change in estimate. And in terms of structure, as you know, we have in place a transformation plan. We are expecting it to be at 35%, of about $1.2 billion plan. And we're always looking for opportunities to drive efficiency in our pricing, and we've been very effective, actually, in pricing for the current market environment as you see in the results that we've delivered. Certainly, in terms of structure, we're looking for opportunities to continually improve our pricing and our ability to price effectively in this dynamic period. Katy Huberty : Thank you for that color. And just as a follow-up, historically, revenue increases 5% to 7% sequentially in October. Is normal seasonality a reasonable expectation given that you're coming from the lower base of revenue in 3Q, given some of the execution issues that need to be addressed, or will it take longer to fix, for instance, this shortfall you saw on PCs in international markets and we shouldn't necessarily be assuming normal seasonality? Thank you. Enrique Lores : Let me take that question, Katy. And I think we need to realize that we are in a very different situation than before the pandemic. Usually, our business is demand-driven, and therefore there is some seasonality driven by buying patterns. Today, our business is totally driven by supply. As I said before, orders exceed significantly what we can produce, and therefore, normal seasonality doesn't apply to a year like this. Because what we will be shipping is not what we will be getting orders for, it's going to be what is the maximum amount of product that we can produce every day, every week, every month. Operator : The next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. My first question is just with regard to underlying trends in Print volumes. And if you can talk about what you're seeing, consumer Soho and the office. And maybe if you can talk about -- within regions that are either I guess returning to the office or reversing course, just to get some ideas of what you're seeing with the data that you get. Thank you. Enrique Lores : Thank you, Shannon. The trends that we are seeing are aligned with the trends that we were expecting to see a quarter ago. We are starting to see recovery in the office side, though I have to say that that recovery is uneven, and if it's impacted by the evolution of the pandemic and certain countries when they are hit, we see offices close again and then we see an impact there. But the trend is positive in terms of office growth. And we see faster growth from the SMB side than on the enterprise side. When I say growth, I mean recovery. On the other side, on the home side, again, as we were expecting, we are starting to see a slowdown as kids are starting to go back to schools in many countries, and the balance of work between home and office is also changing. Again, it is what we were expecting, and in any case, what we see today and the projections that we have now, continue to be above the projections that we have before the pandemic. Shannon Cross : And as a clarification, can you say you're at 80% or 85% of where you were printing? And then my -- [Indiscernible]. And my second question is with regard to acquisitions, especially if you're going to start to see some revenue pressure next year given some of the strength you've seen in PCs this year, where are you at with regard to acquisitions? Thank you. Enrique Lores : In terms of deviation versus the number of pages printed, I gave you a question, it's in the office. It goes between minus 15 and minus 25 or minus 20 something between SMB and enterprise. We're still below what we were to -- where we want to be, but this gives you some ranges. And then in terms of acquisitions, M&A continues to be part of our plan. We have a rigorous framework to analyze the opportunities that we see based on returns, based on alignment and strategy, based on our ability to execute, we are constantly evaluating opportunities in our core businesses, in adjacencies to support our new growth strategies. And this quarter, we had two great examples that show how do we approach and how do we think about M&A. We closed the HyperX deal that is really allowing us to accelerate our growth into the peripheral space. And now we have a leading position in peripherals for gaming. And we did also a very exciting opportunity in the services space with the acquisition of Teradici Corporation that will allow us to integrate into our services Remote Compute for highly complex environments, which many of our customers are utilizing today. So, M&A is part of our plan and we are executing on that when we see the right opportunity. Operator : The next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead. David Vogt : Great. Thank you, guys, for squeezing me in. So, I just wanted to go back, Enrique, to the backlog. Can you give us a little bit more granularity on sort of the mix? I know you mentioned that the Chromebook -- part of the backlog had come down pretty dramatically. But any more color on what that mix might look like given where the margin strength came in in the quarter, so it's a little bit surprising. And then obviously it sounds like you think Chromebooks are going to come back a little bit into the mix. How do you think about sort of order growth from a Chromebook perspective relative to where the backlog is today? What I mean by that is, so when you think about the October quarter should backlog given the supply constraints tick up again given your commentary, or do you think we're at reasonable equilibrium despite the supply chain -- the supply chain constraints from a demand perspective? And then I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Sure. Let me address some of your points. So first of all, the first important factor is backlog grew during the quarter. So, we ended the quarter with a higher backlog than what we had when the quarter started. The mix of the backlog was different. As I said before, we basically fulfilled all the orders that we had with Chromebooks. But the rest of the commercial business and consumers grew significantly. And today, when we closed the quarter, more than 60% of the backlog was coming from commercial customers, which is where margins are higher and where we -- and this is really an important factor to have in mind. As we look at the future, we expect the Chromebook business to accelerate again at the end of Q3 and at the end of Q4. But I think it's important to have in mind that Chromebook represents around 10% of our total PC business, even slightly below that. So, it's a relatively small business for us. What I really want to highlight is the strength of the Commercial business, which really is driven by companies reopening, offices being reopened, and investments that corporations are doing and SMBs are doing in improving their working experience for their employees. David Vogt : And then that's helpful. I appreciate that. And maybe just a follow-up from Marie along those lines. I know you mentioned Q4 margins will be more likely to resemble 1.5 margins in the Personal Systems group. Is that the right way to think about it in terms of Commercial margins are above where we are now and Chromebooks, as it comes back into the mix into Q4, are slightly diluted to margins? And that's how we think about that step-down from 3Q into 4Q, and then into 2022, enterprise or commercial is still relatively strong. Should we be expecting margins in PSG to be above your normal historical 3.5% to 5.5% range? Thanks. Marie Myers : Yeah. So, going into Q4, as I mentioned earlier, we expect PS to be well above our long-term range of 3.5 to 5.5. So just think about it in terms of being similar to the sort of half-one levels and to your comment about Chrome; yes, Chrome margins are usually more diluted to PS now. In terms of '22 and how to think about '22 margins, we're going to talk more about that in terms of the mid and long-term at our Security Analyst Meeting in October. So, I will look forward to seeing you then. Operator : And our last question today is from Ananda Baruah with Luke Capital. Please go ahead. Ananda Baruah : Hey, thanks guys for taking the question. Take 2, if I could. Enrique, just to the remarks you made a few moments ago. If back-to-office gets meaningfully delayed as we go through the fall here, how should we think about the impact of the PC and the printing business? And in that, if the demand for back-to-office PCs is put on hold to any extent, do you think that there could be a switch back to -- is there PC demand still at the home that would need to be satiated? And then I have a follow-up as well. Thanks so much. Enrique Lores : I think that the backlog that we have when the quarter starts is so high -- when I say the backlog is close to one full quarter, this gives you the magnitude of the orders that we haven't been able to fulfill. I think in the short term, really, we are very protected from any deviations versus the [Indiscernible] plans. So, I don't think this will have any big impact from that perspective, Ananda. And what we are seeing is, especially on the PC side, we have not seen a big implication of the offices reopening or not, because more corporations realize that they need to invest in improving the experience for their employees and we are seeing very strong demand across the board. Ananda Baruah : That's really helpful. And then I guess the second one is, the actions that you described, Enrique, with regard to the comments about being under-indexed on the share, and you had talked about the execution al dynamics, outsourced model, components being optimized across SKUs, the ERP system. When do you believe that those actions collectively can start to make an impact that will show up in the P&L? And I'm assuming that also you're suggesting that it will lead to share reversion as well. Enrique Lores : Well, I think in terms of the actions, we have been working on them for a couple of quarters now, and they will have an impact gradually during the next month. This is really more about how do we optimize our performance within the COVID-contained environment. We shouldn't expect that we are going to be able to double our capacity because there are significant shortages of components, but it will have a gradual improvement in our performance, especially when we look at it competitively. And I'm not sure if I understand your comment about share repurchase. We are fully committed to continuing to repurchase stock. We announced that during Q4, we will be buying at least $1.5 billion of shares, and during the analyst's meeting, we will share what are the plans for 2022. Thank you. And I think that was the last question, so let me close by saying thank you to everybody for participating. As you have seen during the call, we remain very optimistic about the opportunities that the new way of working that the hybrid world is opening for us, and we are making very good progress executing our strategy. We continue to see very strong demand. And in the short term, our results are going to be impacted by component availability. It's not a demand-driven world, it's a supply-driven world. In this world, our ability to drive financial results is very strong. We are confident in the future, and this is why we raised guidance for the year, and for Q4 to reflect the confidence that we have in the business. And as we said, we are looking forward to seeing all of you at our Investor Day in October. Thank you. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Enrique Lores : Thanks, Orit. And thank you all for joining today's call. At our Securities Analyst Meeting last month, we shared our plans to continue building a stronger HP, one that delivers sustained revenue, operating profit, EPS, and free cash flow growth. This quarter results reflect our continued momentum against these plans, and they give us great confidence in our future. Let me talk through the details. In Q4 revenue grew 9% to $16.7 billion, non-GAAP EPS grew 52% to $0.94. And we generated more than $900 million of free cash flow while returning $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our Q4 results are a great finish to an exceptional year. For the full year, we grew revenue 12% to $63.5 billion and generated $1.7 billion of incremental non-GAAP operating profit. Non-GAAP EPS grew 66%. This means that we exceeded our value creation plan target for non-GAAP operating profit and EPS a full year ahead of plan and we return a record $7.2 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth opportunities across the business. Our Q4 and full year performance shows our company on a strong foot and hitting its stride. Long-term secular trends such as hybrid play for our competitive thing. Our leadership across our markets and the innovation agenda we are diving are enabling us to turn these trends into tailwinds. We are making organic and inorganic investments to drive profitable growth. We are accelerating our transformation, building new digital capabilities, while also reducing structural costs and driving efficiencies. The progress we are making against our priorities is creating a more growth-oriented portfolio. At our Analyst Day, I shared that we expect our five key growth areas to grow double-digit and generate over $10 billion in revenue in fiscal '22. These businesses collectively grew 12% this quarter. This includes more than 30% growth for our Instant Ink business, as well as more than 20% growth for our industrial graphics portfolio. We see our key growth areas becoming a bigger part of overall revenue and profit mix moving forward. We are driving this growth even as we continue to navigate a complex and dynamic operational environment that includes robust demand and persistent supply constraints. The actions we have been taking to mitigate industry wide headwinds are paying off. There is no quick fix. But we are strengthening our operational execution and making continued progress quarter-by-quarter. And I just want to say how proud I am of the way our teams are stepping up. It has not been easy. But the challenges we have faced have not deterred from driving our business forward. And the fact that we delivered double-digit revenue and profit growth for the year gives us confidence that we enter 2022. Let me now talk about the strength we see across each of our business units. In personnel systems, there continues to be very strong demand. PS revenue and operating profit, each grew double-digit in Q4. And our disciplined execution and pricing strategy allowed us to effectively manage costs and components headwinds. A big part of our success is the improved mix we are driving given our leadership in the commercial PC market. As more offices reopen, we lead our shift toward Windows based commercial products where we saw their strongest demand and highest profitability. We continue to see a significantly elevated order backlog. As I shared last month, we expect component shortages, particularly in ICs to persist into at least the first half of '22. The operational actions we outlined in our Q3 call are generating positive results. We continue to increase our direct engagement with tier two and tier three suppliers. We have expanded long-term agreements to secure capacity. And our digital transformation initiatives are enabling greater real-time visibility to optimize our speed, agility and mix. This work remains a daily priority and we expect our trajectory to continue to improve. We're also creating important innovation that we design for all things hybrid. This includes a new lineup of Windows 11 devices that enable premium computing experiences for work and home. We are also expanding into valuable adjacencies. Last quarter, we introduced HP Presence, the world's most advanced video conferencing system. This is a large opportunity that will continue to grow as our digital and physical worlds converge. Seven out of 10 companies are already investing in technologies that improve hybrid work experience for their employees. HP Presence combined our hardware, software, imaging and peripheral capabilities to create a more immersive experience so that distributed teams can truly feel they are in the same room even if they are not. You will see us continuing to innovate and expand our presence in the growing hybrid collaboration space. We also delivered another quarter of double-digit device as a service revenue growth. This included the launch of new digital services to help commercial customers simplify the complexity of hybrid IT environments. And following the close of our Teradici acquisition, we learned a lineup of new Z by HP, Teradici and Nvidia Omniverse subscription offers to enable high performance remote collaboration. Turning to print, we grew revenue 1% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by our disciplined pricing strategy, as well as our continued growth in services and subscriptions, which offset expected volume declines driven by limited supply. Like others in the industry, we continue to operate in a supply constrained environment driven by COVID-related disruptions and broader logistics issues. Against this backdrop, demand for our prints hardware and supplies remained strong. The fact is, we had more hardware orders that we could fulfill in the quarter. And we said last month, we expect this to impact print growth in fiscal year '22. But this is not stopping us from advancing our strategic priorities. We continue to grow our HP plus portfolio globally, including a rollout to our Envy 7000 series that is designed for families working, learning and creating new memories from home. Importantly, it is built with sustainability in mind and made from over 45% recycled plastic content. We will also grow in our digital services to enable high-risk office printing. A great example is this quarter's launch of HP Managed Print Flex, a new cloud first MPS subscription plan for hybrid work environment. In Q4, we drove double-digit growth of MPS revenue and total contract value. And they support our Workforce Solutions momentum. We are increasingly integrating our offerings across print and personal systems to meet new customer needs and unlock new growth opportunities. Our recently launched HP Work from Home Service is a great example of how we are leveraging our diverse portfolio to win in the hybrid office. As I mentioned earlier, we are also driving industrial graphics and 3D printing growth. In industrial graphics, we drove double-digit revenue growth in the quarter and have built a healthy backlog of industrial presence. This continues the positive recovery trends from prior quarters. We also continue to see a mix shift towards more productive industrial presence with significant growth in labels and packaging. And in 3D, our focus on high value end-to-end application is paving the way for entirely new growth businesses. Our molded fiber, footwear and products initiatives are on track. Our progress against our strategic priorities is also driving strong cash flow. And we continue to be disciplined stewards of capital. We have a robust return-based approach that we are applying to every aspect of our capital allocation. We will continue to invest in areas where we see growth opportunities while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. We believe our shares remains undervalued and we are committed to aggressive repurchase levels of at least $4 billion in fiscal year \u201822. We also expect M&A will continue to play an important role. Specifically, we plan to pursue deals that accelerate our strategies and drive profitable growth. And we are making ongoing progress against our sustainable impact agenda. ESG is a driver of long-term value creation for all stakeholders. And we continue to pursue an ambitious agenda. The latest example is our expanded partnership with World Wildlife Fund. We are working to restore, protect and improve the management of nearly 1 million acres of forest landscapes. This supports our focus on making every page printed forest positive. To sum up, our portfolio is innovative and resilient. Our strategy is driving sustained revenues, operating profits, EPS, and free cash flow growth. We are returning, highly attractive levels of capital to shareholders. And we are confident in the fiscal year '22 guidance that we shared at our Analyst Day. We are entering the New Year from a position of great strength. And I look forward to continuing to share our progress. Let me now turn the call over to Marie, who will take you through the details of the quarter and our fiscal Q1 outlook. Marie, over to you. Marie Myers : Thanks, Enrique. And hello, everyone. It's good to be back together. And it was great to connect with so many of you following your Analyst Day. I want to start by building on something Enrique said a moment ago. Q4 was a strong finish to a very strong year. It builds on our proven track record of meeting or exceeding the goals we set. And it underscores our confidence in our FY '22 and long-term financial outlook. Let me begin by providing some additional color on our results, starting with the full year. Revenue was $63.5 billion, up 12%. Non-GAAP operating profit was $5.8 billion, up 42%. We grew non-GAAP EPS even faster, up 66% to $3.79. This continues our trend of growing non-GAAP EPS every year since separation. Our $4.2 billion of free cash flow was consistent with our full year guidance and adjusting for the net Oracle litigation proceeds and we returned a record $7.2 billion to shareholders. That\u2019s a 172% of free cash flow. What\u2019s especially important to note is how well balanced our performance is. We are growing our top and bottom-line. We are returning capital to shareholders and investing in the business. We are accelerating new growth businesses and driving efficiencies. This reflects the company geared towards both short and long-term value creation as we enter a new period of growth for HP. This is supported by our Q4 numbers. Net revenue was $16.7 billion in the quarter, up 9% nominally and 7% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency : Americas declined 4%, EMEA increased 15% and APJ increased 18%. As Enrique mentioned, supply chain constraints continue to impact both Print and Personal Systems revenue and this was particularly impactful to our print hardware results this quarter. That said, demand remain strong as hybrid work creates sustained tailwinds. Gross margin was 19.6% in the quarter, up 2 points year-on-year. The increase was primarily driven by continued favorable pricing including currency, partially offset by higher costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion or 11.5% of revenue. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased investments in go-to-market and innovation. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.3 billion, up 28% and non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $64 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.32, up 52% to $0.94 with a diluted share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes Oracle litigation gains, defined benefit plan settlement gains, non-operating retirement related credits, partially offset by restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges, other tax adjustments. As a result, Q4 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $2.71. Now, let\u2019s turn to segment performance. In Q4, Personal Systems revenue was $11.8 billion, up 13% year-on-year. Total units were down 9% given the expected supply chain challenges and lower chrome mix. The fact we still grew revenue double digits in this environment reflected the strength of demand and positive impact of our big shift towards mainstream and premium commercial. Drilling into the details, consumer revenue was down 3% and commercial was up 25%. By product category, revenue was up 13% for notebooks, 11% for desktops and 39% for workstations. We also continue to drive double-digit growth across peripherals and services. Personal Systems delivered $764 billion in operating profit with operating margins of 6.5%. Our margin improved 1.4 points, primarily due to continued favorable pricing, product mix and currency, partially offset by higher cost including commodity costs and investments in innovation and go-to-market. In Print, our results reflected continued focus on execution and the strength of our portfolio as we navigated the supply chain environment. Q4 total print revenue was $4.9 billion, up 1%, driven by favorable pricing in hardware and growth in services, partially offset by a decline in supplies. Total hardware units declined 26% due to consumer replenishment last year in Q4 and increased manufacturing and component constraints. We expect these print hardware constraints to extend at least into the first half of 2022. By customer segment, consumer revenue was down 6%, with units down 28%. Commercial revenue grew 19%, with units down 12%. Consumer demand remained solid. However, revenue across both home and office was constrained by the current supply and factory environment. The commercial recovery should further progress with a double-digit hardware revenue growth with triple-digit increases in Industrial printing hardware. We expect to see a continued gradual and uneven recovery in commercial extending into FY \u201922. Supplies revenue was $3.1 billion, declining 2% year-on-year, driven primarily by prior year channel inventory replenishment. We also saw steady normalization of ink and toner mix, partially offset by favorable pricing. We saw continued momentum in our contractual business. As we discussed at our Analyst Day, this is a key part of our broader services strategy. Instant ink delivered double-digit increases in both cumulative subscriber growth in revenue. We also drove growth in managed print services revenue and total contract value with strength in both renewals and new TCV bookings. Print operating profit increased $117 million to [$813 million] [ph] and operating margins were 17%. Operating margin grew 2.2 points, driven primarily by favorable pricing and improved performance in industrial including graphics 3D, partially offset by unfavorable mix at higher cost including commodity costs and investments in innovation and go-to-market. Now let me turn to our transformation efforts. As we completed the second year of our cost savings program, we have now delivered more than 80% of our $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan and we continue to look at new cost savings opportunities. Transformation is not only about cost savings, but about also creating new capabilities and long-term value creation. One example. I\u2019d like to highlight is our ongoing digital transformation. By leveraging our new digital platforms, we are enhancing our capabilities and transforming the way we operate to deliver new solutions to our customers. With this capability, we recently launched Wolf Pro Security, a new subscription service that enables customers to digitally manage their software on an annual subscription basis. The structural cost savings with our transformation efforts are enabling us to invest in these types of strategic growth drivers and we see many more opportunities like this to drive business enablement through additional software services and solutions offerings. Let me now move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q4 cash flow from operations was $2.8 billion and free cash flow was $0.9 billion after the additional adjustment for the net Oracle litigation proceeds of $1.8 billion. The cash conversion cycle was minus 25 days in the quarter. This deteriorated 4 days sequentially as lower days payable outstanding and higher days sales outstanding was only partially offset by the decrease in days of inventory. For the quarter, we returned a total of $2 billion to shareholders, which represented 210% of free cash flow. This included $1.75 billion in share repurchases and $219 million in cash dividends. For FY \u201921, we returned a record $7.2 billion to shareholders or a 170% of free cash flow. Looking ahead to FY \u201922, we expect to continue aggressively buying back shares at elevated levels of at least $4 billion. Our share repurchase program, combined with our recently increased annual dividend of a $1 per share, has us on track to exceed our $16 billion return of capital target set in our value creation plan. Looking forward to Q1 and FY \u201922, we continue to navigate supply availability, logistics constraints, pricing dynamics and the pace of the economic recovery. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our Q1 and overall fiscal 2022 financial outlook. For Personal Systems, we continue to see strong demand for our PCs, particularly in commercial, as well as favorable pricing. We expect solid PS revenue growth to continue into fiscal \u201922 with the shift to higher growth categories, including commercial, premium and peripherals. We expect PS margins to be toward the high-end of our 5% to 7% long-term range. In Print, we expect solid demand in consumer, a continued normalization in mix as commercial gradually improves through 2022 and disciplined cost management. We expect Print margins to be towards the high end, about 16% to 18% long-term range. For Personal Systems, we expect the component shortages, as well as manufacturing port and transit disruptions will continue to constrain revenue due to the ongoing pandemic in many parts of the world. In Print, we expect similar, but more acute challenges, particularly with regard to factory disruptions and component shortages. We expect these challenges across PS and Print to persist at least through the first half of 2022. Furthermore, normal sequential seasonality doesn\u2019t apply for FY \u201922 and we expect our revenue performance to be more linear by quarter, particularly driven by PS. In addition, we expect a slight headwind year-on-year, approximately $20 million per quarter from corporate Investments and other. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook; we expect growth quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.05 and first quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.92 to $0.98. We expect full year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.07 to $4.27 and FY \u201922 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.86 to $4.06. For FY \u201922, we expect free cash flow to be at least $4.5 billion. Overall, I feel very good about our performance and our outlook. I am confident in our ability to deliver consistent long-term sustainable growth and we look forward to taking your questions. So let me hand it back to the operator. Operator : Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot. Good afternoon and congrats on a nice quarter. I guess my first question really is on the personal systems side, a very impressive, I think, reversal on the growth profile versus last quarter ago. It looks like it's heavily driven by ASP's. If my math is right, maybe ASPs are up close to 20%. So I'd love to understand, when I look at the ASP uplift, how much of that is just mix because you perhaps had less Chromebooks versus just apples-to-apples price increases? And then how should we think about the durability of that ASP increase as you go forward into the next fiscal year? Enrique Lores : Hi, Amit, thank you for the question. Let me start and then Marie will provide more detail. So first of all, as you said, we are very pleased with the performance of the PC business this quarter. It is really a consequence of the strong demand that we continue to see, both across consumer, but especially in commercial and the way we have been managing both mix and pricing as you were saying. We have been very effectively managing both, driving the component that we have toward the categories where we saw the highest value for the company, which in general the commercial categories and the high end of the consumer side. And this has really been driving the performance that you saw. And now Marie will comment on pricing. Marie Myers : Sure. Good afternoon, Amit. So, first of all, just to give you some context around ASP's, they're actually up 24% year-on-year and 17% Q-on-Q and what's driving that is really a combination of favorable pricing including some currency, but as you said there's that favorable mix into higher commercial, as well as even a mix shift inside commercial to both premium and mainstream. So we've got less low-end and that favorable mix shift within consumer. In terms of year-on-year, consumers up 11%, driven predominantly by pricing and commercial is up 31.7%, which is a combination of both mix and pricing. And as we've said earlier and I think in our Security Analyst Meeting, we do expect to see some of that favorable mix shift to continue into the following year as well. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. And if I could just follow up, Enrique, I think everyone is sort of used to thinking as supply revenues go down, print margins will be under pressure. And certainly, I think what you're seeing right now, what you're guiding for more important in fiscal '22 would say even if supply start to decline margins should hold up in that 17% to 18% kind of range. So I'd love to get -- kind of get your perspective, what are the two or three big things, vectors that investors should think about that is enabling print margins to expand even as supplies revenues might be a little bit more down next year? Enrique Lores : Thank you. And this is really consistent to what we -- the strategy that we started to execute two years ago, when we are driving the change of profitability from supplies more into hardware. And as we shared during Analyst Meeting, we have been making very good progress driving that strategy. We have increased the mix of products that includes supplies when customers buy them, what we call profit up from products. We have also increased the percentage of end-to-end systems, what we call now HP+. And we have also been driving a transition toward subscription and service-oriented businesses. That is also contributing very positively from a profitability perspective. So what you see happening is what we said two years ago we were going to drive. We have been making good progress and this makes us confident in the guide that we provided for fiscal year '22 in our Analyst Day and about the guidance we have provided today for Q1. Marie Myers : Also just to keep in mind that I'm sure you know this that we're lapping some tough compares. So what we're really focused on is driving incremental OP dollars over time and driving more OP dollars outside of supply and it's exactly what Enrique said to really shifting the business model. Operator : The next question is from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : Congrats on the strong results. Yes, just two if I could. Enrique, any new anecdotal you guys clearly continue to sound as net positive on demand as you did five weeks ago at the Analyst Day. But any new context over the last five weeks with regards to what you're seeing, customer conversations, conversion, anything like that you picked up over the last five weeks would be super helpful? And then I have a quick follow-up. Enrique Lores : What we have seen is, I'm sorry to disappoint you is very consistent to what we discussed in our Analyst Day. We continue to see strong demand, especially from commercial customers and we share their office -- as companies are reopening offices, getting employees back to work, they're investing to improve their experiences and therefore they improve investing in PCs and invest in notebooks and desktops. We also are seeing strong consumer demand as the holiday season comes. We are seeing demand behaving as per plan, so no deviations from what we discussed a few weeks ago. Marie Myers : We had a great quarter with backlog too. So our backlog still remains elevated. Ananda Baruah : Yes. Thanks Marie for that. And then, I guess the follow-up is on the commercial side, any distinction to make what you're seeing between two enterprises small medium business, small medium business has been a good chunk of your business for a while. And so any distinction to make there between the center of demand between those two? Thanks. Enrique Lores : I wouldn't make any big distinction. We see growth across the board, both for large enterprises and for SMBs. We have a very strong business in both areas and we see demand in the two customer segments, so no major deviations from that. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could maybe just provide a little more detail on your backlog. I think last quarter you said that your backlog in PCs was about 13 weeks. Can you provide an update on that? And you mentioned that print, hardware was probably the most supply constrained. So, perhaps if you can dimension the backlog and how much it may have changed in the quarter? And then I have a follow-up, please. Enrique Lores : So in terms of PC backlog, it remains at a very elevated level, Toni, very similar to where we were a quarter ago. So, no major changes. It continues to be similar to what you saw despite a quite a strong business that we have created this quarter. And then, in terms of print, you are correct, print hardware is where we have seen the major supply chain limitations, largely because of the factory lockdowns in many Southeast Asia countries, which is what we shared during the last week. So no news here. And part of this also elevated but is lower than what we have on PCs. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. And then just to follow-up, you talked about the strength in pricing. Prices were up 17% sequentially in PCs, yet your operating margins in PCs were the lowest they were all year. I know there were some incremental supply chain costs, but that kind of price leverage, why did you not see greater operating profit leverage? And then, somewhat related to that, I think you basically said we should sort of ignore traditional seasonality and kind of think of flattish growth throughout the year, but if you're actually going to make any progress in drawing down your backlog and demand remain strong, your seasonality actually should be above normal seasonality because demand is continuing at the same rate, but you're getting a tailwind from backlog ultimately if you're able to draw that down. So maybe you could just help provide some color on both of those things, potential inconsistencies and set me straight? Thank you. Marie Myers : Yes. No worries, Toni, and good afternoon. So when I talk first about seasonality and I'd say that first out that we've seen that strength in the quarter in PS and we do expect that to continue into '22. So as a result, we do expect revenue linearity in the year to be more linear across the quarters and that's more so, Toni, than what we've seen in the last few years. So as sequential revenue growth in '22 is therefore going to be more consistent quarter-to-quarter. And I'll just reiterate like I did it I think at the San Meeting that we don't expect normal seasonality. And then, with respect to the PS operating margins in the quarter. The rate was actually down slightly quarter-on-quarter and that was just really due to you might recall the material change in estimate that we had back in Q3. And also you saw just the strength of the business that we actually had. So we did take the opportunity to make some one-time investments that we don't expect that they are probably going to repeat in in '22. Operator : The next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. Enrique, could you talk a bit about your peripherals initiative, and how -- what we should look for in terms of proof points, and what you've done internally to try to improve that business so that it can contribute in fiscal 2022? And then I've a follow-up. Thank you. Enrique Lores : Sure. Thank you, Shannon. So as we said in our Analyst Day, peripherals is one of the five growth areas of the company, and we think that really is going to be contributing to the sustained growth that we expect to see in Personal Systems. We have done a lot of changes internally to manage the business better. We -- in the past, if you remember, we were calling it attach, and when you call our business attach, you don't put a best engineer, you don't put a investment that the business requires and you don't have the organizational focus, and we have changed all that. We have a dedicated organization to peripherals. We have put some of the strongest leaders in the company to drive that initiative. We are increasing internal investment. We are moving some of our best engineers to the Group, and we have also invested in organic in acquisitions as the acquisition we did with HyperX to reinforce our position in some specific area, like in the case of HyperX in peripherals for gaming. What you will see us doing in the future is to continue to invest in this space. We think we have a great opportunity to continue to grow going forward and we will be providing regular updates of the progress that we are going to see in that category going forward. And just to close, this quarter we have double-digit growth in this category. So we are really pleased with the growth in peripherals. Shannon Cross : Okay. Thank you. And then I was wondering if you could give us an update on 3D printing, what kind of contribution you're seeing? I know you're not going to give a specific numbers, but where that's -- how that's going coming out of the pandemic and where you're seeing strong demand? Thank you. Enrique Lores : Thank you. So let me cover 3D printing from two angles. First is after the pandemic, we are seeing very strong growth in what I would call the traditional 3D printing, basically selling printer, selling supplies and selling services around those, very strong growth we have seen really a pickup of demand. But also, we shared during our Investor Day that we have complemented that part of the business with the investment in three specific end-to-end, we call it applications or businesses where we think we have the opportunity of capturing more value, because we are not just selling the printers, we are designing the parts, and in some cases, we are also selling the parts to the consumers or to the end-users. And we shared in our Investor Day that we were working on molded fiber and sustainable packaging and on orthotics and on footwear, three areas where of businesses in the $8 billion to $12 billion, where we can really drive a strong disruption because we think 3D printing is really going to help us to grow and to transform those industries. So great progress, we are on track, this is what we discussed a few weeks ago. And during 2022, we will continue to provide updates on where we see this business going. Operator : The next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. There is a pretty wide dispersion in revenue growth across the regions this quarter with Americas down 4% and double-digit positive growth in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. What explains that dispersion, some of it is year-on-year comps, but that's not nearly all of it? Are prices passing through in different rates across the regions? Is there differences in how the distribution channels are rebuilding inventory coming out of the downturn, just any context around the pretty wide dispersion in geographic growth? And then I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Yes, I think the dispersion is really driven by what -- how we've been prioritizing and where we have seen growth. If you think about a year ago, we saw very strong growth on the consumer business in North America. And as we have shared, we are now driving our business more towards higher premium categories mostly in commercial, and therefore, this has implications on the year-on-year comparison. This is really what is driving that delta, Katy. Katy Huberty : Okay. And then as a follow-up maybe for Marie, inventory was a use of cash over the past year, it did come down in the fourth quarter. Should we assume that your balance sheet inventory gradually normalizes as you move through fiscal '22? Marie Myers : Yes, no, we expect basically for our inventory levels to remain somewhat elevated while we're through this supply chain constrained environment. However, we do expect to moderate our components depending on the supply and the demand that we see around the components. But certainly as we look forward into the first half of '22, we still expect to see those levels somewhat elevated. Enrique Lores : What you saw Katy is like, what we -- if we're seeing -- if we look at components where availability has improved with the need to maintain those levels of inventory and there we -- therefore we are correcting that. But as Marie was saying, since we expect to continue to be in a supply constrained environment at least through the first half, inventory will stay at high levels. Operator : The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Angela Chan : Hi. This is Angela Chan on for Samik Chatterjee. Just had one question, wanted to dig in a little into the margin here. I think someone mentioned earlier that you had 17% price increase in PCs, and so just thinking about moving forward assuming you have for a favorable pricing into fiscal year '22 and that the supply situation at least starts to, seems to be stabilizing or may be easing a bit, should we expect to see margin for to remain at that elevated level even beyond your first quarter guidance? Marie Myers : Yes, no, sure, and good afternoon. So we are very much on track towards the high end of our long-term SAM range which we gave at our Analyst Day for PS. So we continue to see that strong demand for our PCs, particularly in commercial and we expect to see that favorable pricing as well, and that's how we think about our guide for Q1. I would just add, I think I mentioned to Toni that we were down slightly Q-on-Q and that was really driven by the material change in estimate we had last quarter. But going forward, we absolutely expect our PS margins to continue to be at the high end of our long-term range. Enrique Lores : And just a brief reminder, we increased our long-term range a few weeks ago. So what we are saying is we are going to stay at the high end of the new ranges that we just provided. Angela Chan : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney Ho : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I got two questions. First one is you mentioned your backlog is staying at elevated level, now that you have another quarter of serving this dynamics, can you talk about how you monitor to make sure that orders are real, and how confident are you that once supply constraints start to ease you don't see a sharp decline in -- sharp increase in cancellation rate or decline in this backlog? And I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Yes, thank you. So, as we have shared in the past, this is really something that we pay a lot of attention to, and we constantly monitor all the orders that we get, the quality of the orders and what cancellations are happening. And as we have shared before, the percentage of cancellations is very, very slow -- is very, very small. So we have not seen any cancellations. Also as we look at the competition of the backlog, the majority of the backlog now is coming from commercial customers, given that this is where we continue to see the stronger demand. Usually, there is an end user or in many cases, it is an end-user associated with our backlog, so it means the probabilities of double booking or cancellations even lower. But we rest assured, this is something we monitor constantly and we don't see any cancellations. Now, of course, our goal is to over time to reduce the amount of backlog that we have because -- and we expect that, that supply will get normalized during the next quarter, we will be reducing the amount of backlog that we have. Sidney Ho : Great. That's helpful. Maybe my follow-up question is on the free cash flow for fiscal '22 of more than $4.5 billion, how should we think about the profile of that going to look like as we go through the year, typically you see the lowest free cash flow in fiscal second quarter and highest in fiscal third quarter, but this year could be different, but any other factors we should be thinking about? And kind of related to that, how may that change the amount of share buyback as we go through the year? Thanks. Marie Myers : Yes, so maybe I'll hit up cash flow and then we'll go to the buyback. So, first of all, we guide cash flow on an annual basis. And as we mentioned at SAM, we're confident in our guide of at least $4.5 billion. A couple of things to bear in mind, obviously cash flows driven by revenue and operating profit growth, and then secondly, I think we did comment that we did expect to see some favorable working capital as we start to see those inventory levels potentially moderate in the second half. So that's how we're thinking about, we've built that all into our guide basically in terms of free cash flow. With respect to our buybacks, we remain committed to repurchase at least 4 billion of our shares, and as you probably recently saw at our Analyst reports, Analyst meeting as well, we're expecting to pay out a dividend of $1 per share. So I think really a meaningful plan there with respect to our buybacks starting to return of capital to our shareholders. Operator : The next question is from David Vogt with UBS. David Vogt : Great. Thank you for taking my question. I just have one question, it's more of a financial philosophical question. And trying to think through your long-term financial framework that sort of underpins the high single-digit EPS growth that you laid out at SAM, and if I just take sort of your framework at face value as operating profit grows and your dividend grows along with up profit and/or earnings, what are sort of the parameters that you're using to think about the buyback in terms of how much you want to use, because as the stock appreciates, and let's say the multiple expansion you no longer quote-unquote undervalued or maybe even less value, I would imagine that you might ratchet down or maybe pull back on the buyback, and that seems to be a pretty important part of the longer-term EPS growth that you've laid out at the SAM. So just want to get a bit of an understanding how you're thinking about it over the longer-term? Thanks. Marie Myers : Yes, maybe I'll just start out by commenting firstly that our FY22 guidance is a combination of both operational flow-through and the results of share buyback. Now addressing your question specifically about how we're sitting, thinking about your philosophical question around the buybacks, look I would just say that we're absolutely committed to the capital allocation strategy that we've outlined at SAM, and those ingredients, nothing has changed there and a big part of that is our return of capital to shareholders. So we're on track to continue to buy back shares at elevated levels of at least 4 billion. And in fact, I think we're going to surpass what we said we do back at our value plan of at least $16 billion. So that's how we're thinking about it, and our commitment really hasn't changed. Enrique Lores : And maybe to complement a little what Marie was saying. What we have committed is that we will be returning, and I'm talking about the long-term, 100% of free cash flow unless other better opportunities arise, and we have also committed to increase our leverage ratio to two points, and we will be doing this over time. So both will be sources of cash that we will be using to return capital to shareholders or potentially to M&A, if we -- if M&A would bring better returns. David Vogt : Great. Maybe just as a quick follow-up, Enrique. So does that imply that the dividend effectively a sort of -- a sort of marching in lockstep with sort of earnings growth and then the flexible use of cash flow between M&A will be -- the cash flow will be between M&A and buybacks over the longer-term? Enrique Lores : I believe, while we believe that the shares are undervalued, and this is clearly the situation today, so this is what you should expect us to do, thinking at least while we see that delta. Operator : The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Hi. Yes, thank you. In your prepared commentary, Enrique, you mentioned that M&A -- you also called out M&A as an important lever, and I was curious, just given the strong cash flow, free cash flow that you would be generating plus the payment from Oracle, you have a sizable warchest for M&A. So any sizing parameters, anything that you can share with us, and what you're looking, should we expect similar to what you've done here in the recent past or something larger? Enrique Lores : Yes, so let me kind of remind what we have been discussing during the last weeks. First is, we have shared that M&A is an important part of our plan. Second, we have identified five key growth areas for the company, where we think M&A could help us to grow profitably at a faster way and that we are scanning opportunities to do that. At the same time, we have also said that we are going to be very rigorous stewards of capital that any opportunity we would take versus the strategy, versus the operational ability that we need to have to deliver on the financial goals, and then, of course, we need to have attractive returns, whether to return the buyback shares, which is a fairly high threshold given that we believe that shares are undervalued. In terms of specific side, I don't think we have any -- we haven't made any commitment on -- commitments on that space. They really need to deliver strong financial results and based -- and that be aligned with their strategies. But we are not going to do anything different because of the Oracle cash that we got. We are going to continue to manage capital with the framework that we have been discussing until now and with the same rigor. Wamsi Mohan : Okay, thanks, Enrique. If I could follow up, a few people have asked about the ASP and the sustainability, and clearly you talk about strong demand backlog and this ASP strength to sustain in fiscal '22. But if I could ask it maybe a little differently, how much of this ASP increase would you attribute to the tightness in the market, which is driving favorable pricing versus potentially as supply improves over the course of the next few quarters, do you still anticipate the mix can drive these sort of elevated levels of ASP growth? Thank you. Enrique Lores : Yes, I think the key thing really is what is going to be the gross margin that we will be delivering or the operating profit margin. And as Marie was saying, we increased our guidance a few weeks ago and we expect to continue to be at the high end of the range through 2022. What we think will happen is eventually the price favorability will reduce as volumes will increase, but as volumes will increase, we will also see additional business. So one will compensate the other. So we will stay within the high end of the range through 2022. Marie Myers : And I'd just add, we are still in that, it's a bit like the laws of economics while you're in a supply constrained environment, favorable pricing really persist, but in addition, demand is strong. So together, that really contributes to what we've seen in terms of this favorable pricing dynamic, which we do expect will continue through '22, but we do expect some normalization as the year goes on as well. Operator : The next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Jake Arbon : Hi, this is Jake on for Aaron. Congrats on the great quarter. Just really quick, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the graphics market and then kind of just how you're thinking about that business heading into 2022? Enrique Lores : Yes. So we are seeing a strong recovery of the overall industrial graphics business, mostly driven for the -- by the more industrial side driven by label and packaging. We have seen nice growth in Q4 and we expect to see very nice growth in 2022. So really good progress and really a contributor of growth for the company in 2022. Jake Arbon : And just as kind of a follow-up on to that. Is that a market you guys would be targeting for M&A with just how fragmented it is, is that something you're focused on? Enrique Lores : Well, we have a very strong portfolio in that category that is a combination of both internal development of M&A that we have done over the years. We have done several acquisitions in that space, both in printing technologies and also in software, and we have identified this as one of the key five growth areas of the company. And as I said, M&A is part of our plan, we expect to continue to do that in 2022. And as we also shared, we have room to do that, while at the same time, we return aggressive capital to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. And as I said before, over time, we will be increasing our ratio to 1.5 to 2, which will be also another source of capital. Jake Arbon : Great. Thank you. Enrique Lores : And I think it's now time to wrap up. So let me close the call by saying that we really feel strong about the quarter that we have, it's a great proof point of the ability that we have to deliver value to our shareholders and shows the strong momentum that we have entered in fiscal year '22. And this is why we provided the guide that we provided for Q1 that shows the things that we see in our business. So, thank you everybody for the call today. And we wish all of you a great Thanksgiving with your families. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Enrique Lores : Thanks, Orit, and thank you all for joining today\u2019s call. Before I discuss the quarter, I want to briefly address the unfolding situation in Ukraine. The well-being of our people, their families and our customers and partners is our top concern. We are doing everything we can to keep them safe. We want nothing more than to see peace and stability restored to the region. We have an experienced cross-functional team in place focused on business continuity. The environment is very fluid and we are preparing for a range of scenarios. And in the meantime, in compliance with administration\u2019s recently approved sanctions, we have suspended shipments to Russia. The difficult situation in Ukraine is the latest in a series of global challenges we have faced. Time and again, our team has shown remarkable agility and determination, and I have great confidence in their ability to manage these situations. When we were last together at the end of 2021, I talked about our strategy to modernize our core, expand into valuable adjacencies and build a more growth-oriented portfolio. And our first quarter results show the progress we are making against this plan. We continue to see very strong demand, driven in large part by the secular tailwinds associated with hybrid. The way people work and live have fundamentally changed, and we see this trend continuing across our segments long past the pandemic. This creates incredible opportunities for innovation and growth. Companies are reconfiguring office space to be more collaborative, and this is requiring a refresh in their IT strategies, services and security offerings. Consumers are investing to improve their home office setups as hybrid work becomes the norm. And when they are not working, people are looking for more immersive entertainment experience with improved video, audio and battery performance. Underlying all these is a growing desire from both consumers and commercial customers to buy from companies with well-developed ESG goals. Each of these trends play to our strength and they drove our Q1 results. We grew revenue, operating profit, EPS and free cash flow, continuing our track record of meeting or exceeding our commitments. Let me walk through the details. For the quarter, revenue grew 9% to $17 billion. This is our highest-ever quarterly revenue since separation, driven by demand for our products and services. Non-GAAP EPS grew more than twice as fast as revenue, up 20% to $1.10, and we generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow while returning 127% of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our results were particularly strong in the key growth areas that I outlined last year. Collectively, these businesses grew double digits this quarter. This includes more than 20% growth in gaming, more than 40% growth in peripheral and 20% growth for our industrial graphics and 3D portfolio. We are bullish in our opportunities in this area, and we expect them to become a larger part of our overall revenue and profit mix moving forward. We delivered while continuing to navigate a complex environment of industry-wide component shortages and logistical constraints. Despite steady progress against our plans to strengthen our operational processes, it will take time before the gap between supply and demand fully dissipates. We are securing more parts for products, sourcing from alternate part suppliers and allocating available parts to optimize our product mix. This is an area of relentless focus for our team. Let me now talk about the progress we see across each of our business units. In Personal Systems, it was a record quarter with our highest revenue and operating profit since separation. Revenue grew 15% to more than $12 billion. We delivered OP rate above the high end of our target range, and our disciplined execution and pricing strategy enabled us to manage cost and component headwinds. A big contributor to our success is the improved mix we are driving. Our leadership in the commercial PC market is a significant competitive advantage as more and more offices reopen. This is where we saw the most demand and highest profitability. Within commercial, we saw strong growth in Windows-based notebooks and mobile workstations, where our share expanded this quarter. In consumer, we continue to experience demand shift into high-value categories like premium and gaming. We also reduced our backlog quarter-over-quarter and our supply chain actions are generating positive results. And as we prioritize operational execution, we continue to innovate at the heart of hybrid. Last month, we had our biggest Consumer Electronics Show ever, launching nearly 50 new innovations that are changing the way people collaborate, create and play. This included a major expansion of our portfolio of HP Presence-enabled devices as we strengthen our position in the large and growing video conferencing market. We also launched our latest gaming solutions and peripherals, including a new HyperX wireless headset that can last 300 hours on a single charge. Turning to Print, we continue to face industry-wide supply chain challenges. As a result of component shortages and logistics exceptions, revenue declined 4% in the quarter and our elevated order backlog increased sequentially. We now expect these dynamics to impact Print throughout March of fiscal year 2022. We are driving a very disciplined pricing and allocation strategy across Print, and our operating profit rate of 18.2% was above the high end of our target range. We are also making good progress against our long-term priorities. We continue to modernize core Print and drive HP+ global adoption. HP+ is a big selling point of our new ENVY Inspire lineup, which we successfully launched in the U.S. last year and roll out across Europe in Q1. And we are seeing strong demand for our commercial portfolio as companies plan for office reopenings. We are earning accolades for industry leadership in areas such as hybrid work, security and print sustainability. It was an outstanding quarter for our industrial printing businesses. In industrial graphics, we generated another quarter of double-digit revenue growth and have built a healthy backlog of industrial presence. This illustrates the positive recovery trend from prior quarter. And we delivered significant year-over-year revenue growth in 3D printing. More than 120 million Multi Jet Fusion parts have been printed, and we are accelerating our strategy to create high-value end-to-end applications in vertical markets. Along these lines, we completed the acquisition of Choose Packaging. Choose has invented the world\u2019s only commercially available zero-plastic paper bottle, and they are working with many global brands to commercialize their offerings, including large enterprises like Henkel. This acquisition complements our molded fiber solution and positions HP well in the $10 billion fiber-based sustainable packaging industry. There are more than 150 million tons of single-use plastics produced each year, and we intend to disrupt this market with fiber-based 100% plastic-free packaging. In fact, our focus on sustainability is driving innovation across our entire portfolio. In Personal Systems, we now have more than 300 products made using ocean bottle plastic. And in Print, we recently launched the most sustainable toner cartridge we have ever developed. This supports our broader ESG and sustainable impact strategy. The actions we are taking on climate, human rights and digital equity are differentiating our brand and helping to drive our business forward. In fact, our sustainable impact agenda helped us to win more than $3.5 billion in new sales in fiscal 2021. This is a threefold increase over the previous year, reflecting the power of our commitments. Our partners are also doubling down on sustainability. More than 10,000 channel partners across over 40 countries are now able to participate in HP Amplify impact, a first-of-its-kind partner program aligned with our sustainable impact strategy. It is a great example of how we are leveraging our global scale to help address some of society\u2019s biggest challenges while also positioning our business for success. The progress we are making across our strategic priority is driving strong cash flow. And we continue to be disciplined stewards of capital. We have a robust return-based approach that we are applying to every aspect of our capital allocation strategy. We expect to continue to make organic and inorganic investments in areas where we see growth opportunities while continuing to return capital to our shareholders, and we are committed to aggressive repurchase levels of at least $4 billion in fiscal year 2022. It was an excellent start to the year. We are delivering on our commitment and creating significant value for our shareholders. We are returning highly attractive levels of capital to shareholders, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained revenue, operating profit, EPS and free cash flow growth as we build a stronger HP. Let me now turn the call over to Marie who will take you through the details of the quarter and our fiscal Q2 outlook. Marie, over to you. Marie Myers : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s great to connect with all of you again. I want to start where Enrique left off in terms of our performance in the quarter. It was a very strong start to the year. Demand for our technology, favorable trends such as hybrid and powerful innovation across our portfolio are driving long-term value creation. And you see this reflected in our Q1 results as we delivered across all of our key financial metrics, including growing revenue, operating profit and EPS. Let me give you a closer look at the details. Net revenue was $17 billion in the quarter, up 9% nominally and 8% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas declined 1%, EMEA increased 8% and APJ increased 28%. Demand remains strong, creating sustained tailwinds across our businesses. But as Enrique mentioned, supply chain constraints remain a top line headwind for both Personal Systems and Print revenue. These dynamics were particularly impactful to our Print hardware results, which I will talk about in a moment. Gross margin was 19.9% in the quarter, down 1.3 points year-on-year. The decrease was primarily driven by increased Personal Systems mix and higher costs, including commodities and logistics, partially offset by pricing, including currency. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion or 11.1% of revenue. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased investments in go-to-market, partially offset by lower Personal Systems R&D due to partner funding. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.5 billion, up 1.5% and non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $66 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.18 or 20% to $1.10, with a diluted share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $117 million, primarily related to : restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges and other tax adjustments, partially offset by non-operating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q1 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.99. Now let\u2019s turn to segment performance. In Q1, Personal Systems revenue was $12.2 billion, up 15% year-on-year. Total units were down 6%, given the expected supply chain challenges, logistics delays and lower chrome mix. Despite this, we still grew revenue double digits, reflecting the strength of Windows demand, favorable pricing and our mix shift towards higher-value categories like mainstream and premium commercial. As an example, commercial PC Windows units were up over 20% year-on-year. Drilling into the details. Consumer revenue was down 1% and commercial was up 26%. By product category, revenue was up 14% for notebooks, 17% for desktops and 40% for workstations. We also continued to drive double-digit growth across peripherals, gaming and device as a service, each of which are part of what Enrique shared as our focus on creating a more growth-oriented portfolio. Personal Systems delivered almost $1 billion of operating profit with operating margins of 7.8%. Our margin improved 0.7 points primarily due to favorable pricing, including currency, product mix, operating expense mix and R&D funding, partially offset by higher commodity costs. In Print, our results reflected our focus on execution and the strength of our portfolio as we navigate the supply chain environment. In Q1, total Print revenue was $4.8 billion, down 4%, driven by lower print hardware units and lower supplies revenue. This was partially offset by favorable pricing in hardware and growth in industrial graphics and services. Total hardware units declined 28%, largely due to continued component and logistics constraints, which we now expect to extend into the second half of 2022. By customer segment, consumer revenue was down 23% with units down 31%. Commercial revenue grew 9% with units down 3%. demand remains solid. However, revenue across both home and office was again constrained by the current supply chain and logistics environment. The commercial recovery showed further progress, with hardware revenue growth and double-digit increases in both industrial graphics and large format. We expect to see a gradual and uneven recovery in commercial extending through 2022. Supplies revenue was $3.1 billion, declining 2% year-on-year, consistent with our outlook that we provided at our Analyst Day. The decline was driven primarily by further normalization in home printing, as expected, partially offset by the gradual recovery in commercial. We saw momentum in our contractual business, with Instant Ink once again delivering double-digit increases in both cumulative subscriber growth in revenue. We also drove Managed Print Services revenue and total contract value with renewal TCV up double-digit. Print operating profit was $879 million, declining $119 million and operating margin was 18.2%. Operating margin decreased 1.6 points, driven primarily by a tough prior year compare and higher costs, including commodity and logistics costs. This was partially offset by pricing, including currency and improved performance in industrial graphics and 3D. Now let me turn to our transformation efforts. As we move into the third year of our cost savings program, we remain steadfast in our focus on delivering on our $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan. Our transformation continues to create new capabilities and long-term value creation. In Print, for example, we are modernizing our digital ecosystem by consolidating our software and firmware platforms. Our new architecture provides a digital ecosystem, allowing us to develop modern capabilities and services offerings to drive differentiated customer experiences via our HP Smart App. In addition, we are leveraging these digital ecosystem enhancements to streamline and scale our big data platform capabilities, allowing us to gain valuable real-time insights about our customers and business operations. The structural cost savings from our transformation efforts are enabling these types of strategic growth drivers, and we see many more opportunities to drive business enablement through additional software, services and solutions offerings. Now let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q1 cash flow for operations and free cash flow was strong at $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The cash conversion cycle was minus 33 days in the quarter. This improved eight days sequentially as higher days payable outstanding and lower days sales outstanding was only partially offset by the increase in days of inventory. Significant capital return remains a key part of our capital allocation strategy. In Q1, we returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders, which represented 127% of free cash flow. This included $1.5 billion in share repurchases and $271 million in cash dividends. We expect to aggressively buy back shares of at least $4 billion in FY 2022, and we remain on track to exceed our $16 billion return of capital targets. Looking forward to Q2 and the rest of FY 2022, we continue to model multiple scenarios related to supply availability, logistics constraints, pricing dynamics and the overall macro environment. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our Q2 and overall financial outlook. We are raising our full year outlook for FY 2022 to reflect the strength of our Q1 results and expected strength of our Q2 performance. We expect currency to be about 1% year-over-year headwind for FY 2022. With regard to the financial impact of the unfolding situation in Ukraine, including the current sanctions on Russia, we are factoring in our best assumptions at this time, recognizing that the situation remains fluid and highly uncertain. In Q2, we expect a negative impact to our top line and bottom line as a result of the sanctions that have been imposed. In total, net of mitigations, we have factored in a $0.02 to $0.03 EPS headwind to our Q2 guidance. For the second half of 2022, the broad ramifications of the situation in Europe and beyond are uncertain and we are monitoring this closely. For Personal Systems, we continue to see strong demand for our PCs, particularly in commercial as well as favorable pricing. We expect solid PS revenue growth to continue through fiscal 2022 with a further shift towards higher-value categories, including commercial, premium and peripherals. Specifically for Q2, we expect our top line results to be incrementally constrained by a volatile supply chain and logistics environment and also the dynamic macro environment, including the Russia situation, all negatively impacting our top line. In total, we expect a high single-digit decline quarter-on-quarter to Personal Systems revenue. We expect PS margins at the high end of our 5% to 7% long-term range, particularly in Q2. In Print, we expect solid demand in consumer, favorable pricing, disciplined cost management and further normalization and mix as commercial gradually improves through 2022. With regard to Print supply chain, we expect similar to what we saw in Q1, component shortages and logistics delays to constrain revenue. We expect these supply chain constraints to continue into the second half of 2022. We now expect Print margins to be at the high end of our 16% to 18% range for FY 2022. For Q2 specifically, given the continued hardware constraints we are anticipating, we expect Print margin to be above our 16% to 18% range. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook. We expect second quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.08, and second quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.95 to $1.01. We expect FY 2022 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.18 to $4.38, and FY 2022 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.87 to $4.07. For FY 2022, we expect our free cash flow to be at least $4.5 billion. We are making excellent progress against our priorities, and I am confident in our ability to deliver consistent, long-term sustainable growth. I\u2019ll stop here, so we can take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much for taking my questions. Given the importance of ASP growth in your revenue, can you help us to understand a little bit more about the dynamics behind what\u2019s driving the increases, both in print and PCs? And what I\u2019m thinking is how much of the growth is related to mix, like in PCs going to commercial from consumer and versus sort of how much are the price increases more on a like-for-like basis and they\u2019re kind of positioned to offset inflation? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Marie Myers : Hey Shannon, good afternoon. How are you? I hope you\u2019re doing well. So first of all, I\u2019ll just start out by saying, look, we\u2019ve continued to see the benefit from favorable pricing, as you mentioned, due to the dynamics around supply and demand imbalances. And with respect to how we see it to mix shifts, we\u2019ve seen the impact of mix shifts year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter from consumer to commercial. As you heard in the \u2013 in our earnings announcement, we had a very strong performance on our revenue in commercial, particularly in PCs. So in PS and in Print hardware, that mix shift was actually what drove a lot of the strength that you\u2019ve seen in ASPs. Shannon Cross : Was some of it inflation, though, or\u2026? Marie Myers : Well, actually, we have been pricing - I think one of the benefits we\u2019ve seen in the quarter is the impact of favorable pricing. So right now, we\u2019ve been able to price through the impacts that we\u2019ve been seeing around supply chain, commodity costs and logistics. So I\u2019d say overall, we\u2019re managing the pricing environment very well. Shannon Cross : Okay. And then the second question is just on free cash flow. Going forward, you had a significant benefit from accounts payable. How should we think about free cash flow dynamics as we look through the year? And how are you thinking about perhaps the ability \u2013 I mean, what\u2019s going on now in Europe is sort of throwing this all in the air. But in terms of the ability to maybe manage inventory levels a bit better and bleed through some of the excess component inventory you may have. Thanks. Marie Myers : Yes, no. Sure Shannon. So first of all I\u2019d start out by saying that, look, we\u2019re really pleased with the free cash flow in the quarter of $1.4 billion. And I\u2019d just, at this point in time, reiterate that we\u2019re still confident in our guide of at least $4.5 billion. And I\u2019d just point out that given the supply chain challenges that you referred to, we are not planning to decrease our inventory as we originally commented. Therefore, we expect, at this point in time, to stay on track to our guide of at least $4.5 billion. In addition, I\u2019d add, just in closing, that typically we don\u2019t adjust out, I think, our free cash flow guide at in the quarter either. Operator : The next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Ananda Baruah : Yes. Hi, good afternoon guys. Hey congrats on the solid execution and the ongoing amendment. I appreciate you guys taking the question. Two if I could. I guess I jumped on a few minutes late, so I apologize if this was already talked to. But what are you guys thinking at this juncture for PC growth for the year? And if you have like a calendar year view also, that would be helpful. And then I have a quick follow-up as well. Thanks. Enrique Lores : Let me \u2013 hi Ananda. I will give you, first, a view of what do we think in the market, and then Marie will give you some comments on the guide. I think market-wise, we continue to see strong demand on the PC side. The market projection for this year is that it will be around $200 billion bigger than what it was before the pandemic. And we don\u2019t expect to see the level of growth that we saw in the past, but we think that the market is going to stay at the level where it is today, which is, again, significantly higher than it was before the pandemic. Now Marie will talk about our guide and what we expect to see in our side. Marie Myers : Yes, Ananda. Good afternoon. I hope you are doing well. So for the year, we expect PS margins to be at the high end of the range. Now I would comment just to note that in Q1, there were some partner benefits from our Personal Systems partners that were onetime in nature. So if you look at our PS rate in Q1, if you exclude those benefits, we\u2019re still ahead of the Q1 EPS range. But basically, we\u2019d be at the high end. And so if you think about \u2013 the way to think about the margins in the rest of the year is really it\u2019s that mix shift that we\u2019re seeing towards commercial, those higher-margin categories are driving the rate. And finally, we\u2019re seeing that the benefit of favorable pricing. And we\u2019re really seeing the ability for us to be able to reprice for some of those commodity challenges that are out there in the market. Ananda Baruah : That\u2019s helpful. And then just my follow-up is, I know throughout 2021, you guys have been putting in some initiatives to improve your positioning for component allocation. And was just wondering what the state of those are today. And do you think you\u2019ll be successful in procuring, so improving your component allocation share as you go through the year? Enrique Lores : Let me take that question. So, I think the progress we are making is reflected in the strong results that we had in Personal Systems this quarter. As we said during our Investor Day, our focus was really on getting capacity and getting components for the premium categories for commercial, and the growth in this area reflects the progress we have made. So, we are pleased with the progress. At the same time, we have to acknowledge that the situation continues to be difficult. We expect to continue to be and to operate with high levels of inventory through the \u2013 of backlog through the end of the year, but we are making good progress, Ananda. Operator : The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you. Since you spoke about PCs some, can we talk a little bit about printing? And specifically, can you talk about the supply chain about ink as well as print units in the channel versus equilibrium, a little bit about that? And then maybe my follow-up I\u2019ll ask right now about what type of assumptions or page volumes are you expecting versus, say, pre-COVID levels? Enrique Lores : So let me talk about the situation first on the hardware and then I will talk about supplies. On \u2013 from the hardware perspective, shipments this quarter have been impacted by availability of supply. As we shared both in our Investor Day and during our Q4 earnings call, we have a majority of the factories for printers and of our suppliers in Southeast Asia, and those countries were in full lockdown the majority of the fall until December. And therefore, we are seeing now the impact of that situation. Additionally, in Print, we used several components that are ASICs that have been designed by us, where also we are seeing shortages. So as a consequence of both, we clearly had our sales impacted this quarter, and we expect this to continue through the rest of the year. In the case of supplies, the situation has significantly improved. We don\u2019t have any more limitations in terms of shipment. And the supplies business overall performed in a very positive way, similar to what we shared during our Investor Day, so no big deviation from the plan that we had. Marie Myers : I\u2019ll just add, on the comments on the channel, I think you brought up, right now for both print hardware and supplies, we\u2019re comfortably within our range, and in some cases, due to those supply constraints that Enrique referred to, we\u2019re actually below in some cases. Jim Suva : Great. And then the follow-up about assumptions of return to the office versus pre-COVID levels for printing, what\u2019s your thoughts on that? Enrique Lores : Yes. So let me go, on the office side, again, no different from what we shared a few months ago. We expect that the volume of pages and the overall size for the market will be around 80%, 80, of what it was pre-COVID. We \u2013 and we are on our way to get there. Clearly, because of Omicron and the delays in some office reopening, we\u2019re still not there, but we are seeing steady progress. In the case of home, the market is now stronger than what we were predicting before COVID, and we expect it to continue to be for the foreseeable future. Operator : The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you for taking the question. Maybe I could first ask for just better clarification on what is happening with backlog. I think Enrique, in your prepared remarks, you said that PC backlog came down in the quarter, but Marie said that supply was a constraint to PCs in the quarter. So maybe you can be explicit about either how your backlog changed in the quarter for both PCs and print hardware, or you can comment on order growth versus hardware in the quarter. That would be helpful to dimension that backlog question. And then I have a follow-up, please. Enrique Lores : Sure. So let me take that one. As I said in the prepared remarks, in the case of Personal Systems of PCs, we saw a decline of backlog during the quarter. It was driven by two things : number one is the progress we made on the supply chain side, being able to address the demand that we had in categories like commercial or premium. It was also was driven down because we saw a slowdown in some other categories like, for example, low-end consumer where we have seen a reduction of demand. The combination of both drove a reduction of backlog, but we are still operating with significantly higher backlog than what we normally do. So backlog remains elevated and we expect it to continue to be elevated for \u2013 during the next quarters. In the case of Print, the situation is different. Backlog grew quarter-on-quarter because of the two factors I explained before, where the factories are located and also the availability of certain components like ASICs or other type of power chips that we are still experiencing shortages. Toni Sacconaghi : That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the color. Could you quantify specifically what happened to PC backlog in the quarter? I think last quarter, you said it was nearly a quarter of backlog, so either provide the number of weeks that it came down or what the relative order growth rate was in dollar terms for PCs relative to your revenue rate, that would be really helpful. And then just so I \u2013 just to clarify on guidance for my second question. It looks like normal seasonality is down 4% or 5% sequentially. I think on your last call, you sort of said this is going to be a wacky year in terms of normal seasonality. So, how do we think about what seasonal growth will be in Q2? I think you said PCs would be down high single digits sequentially. How do we think about overall revenue for HP on a sequential basis? And how do we sort of think about seasonality for the year? Are your comments around kind of a more smooth year still sort of how we should expect things or can you add any color on that? So just a follow-up on specificity on PC backlog, please and then Q2 and seasonality for the remainder of the year. Thank you. Enrique Lores : Yes. So on PC backlog, I will only be a little bit more specific. It is below one quarter, which is where we were, but continues to be very elevated. Maybe the other color I will provide is similar to what I shared a week last \u2013 a quarter ago, we are seeing it more concentrated now in some areas of the portfolio like commercial and premium home. This is where the backlog is elevated. And Marie will take the question on guide. Marie Myers : Hey, Toni good afternoon. So in terms of just addressing your question around seasonality, very much in line with what we said at the Analyst Day that normal seasonality, I\u2019ll just start out there, doesn\u2019t apply for FY 2022. Obviously, now as you think about Q2 and beyond, we\u2019ve had a very strong start to the year. And as a result of that, with the performance that we\u2019ve had a year in Q1, we expect now a much more balanced first half versus second half. And so we\u2019re no longer expecting our revenue to be more linear across the quarters as we have historically seen. And then just to sort of reiterate the point that you made around Personal Systems revenue, as we said earlier, due to the record revenue, the Russian situation and the continuing supply challenges that you\u2019ve heard Enrique talk about, we do expect Q2 PS revenue to decline high single digits sequentially. I hope that helps. Operator : The next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. I guess, first on the supply side, very specifically within Print, I think it was down 2%, 3% year-over-year in Jan quarter. I\u2019m wondering how should we think about supplies in April quarter and even beyond because you compare start to get very difficult in that business. So, I\u2019d love to understand how you\u2019re going to see that supplies business stack up for the next couple of quarters, because I don\u2019t think you have a whole lot of supply chain issues in that piece of the business. Enrique Lores : So, I think on the \u2013 in supplies, what the performance is for this quarter is in line to the guide that we provided at some in during the Investor Day, where decline that we said we expected supplies to decline low to mid-single digits. And when we look at the rest of the year, we expect that this will continue and be aligned to that projection, Amit. Again, as I said before, supplies performed as we were expecting. Very small deviations, slight reductions or usage in the office side as offices were closed were probably below expectations, but share and price compensated for that. So overall, in line to what we were expecting. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then if I could just follow up, either Enrique and Marie, but when I think about the full year guide that\u2019s been raised right now, you\u2019re sort of implying 12%, 14% EPS growth, I think, for fiscal 2022. Could you just talk about how do I think about the delta or how much of that is going to come from buybacks versus operating profit dollar expansion, operating profit dollar growth? Because in Q1, at least, your shares on reduction was 15%. So if that momentum sustained, you could conceivably achieve your full year guide, even if your operating profit dollars don\u2019t have any growth. So maybe just talk about how that math works for you for the year. Marie Myers : Yes, sure. Good afternoon. It\u2019s Marie here. So look, I think at our guide at Analyst Day, we commented that the operating profit flow-through was really a full fiscal year view. So, I\u2019d just say that we\u2019re confident that we will see the total of Print and PS operating profit dollars, that they will increase year-on-year for the full year 2022, though I would just point out, it\u2019s probably going to vary quarter-by-quarter. Enrique Lores : And I think it\u2019s important to remember, Amit, that how strong last year was because we are saying we are going to be growing EPS and also profit after a very, very strong year. So that\u2019s we always important to remember, given the compare that we had in 2021. Operator : The next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. Marie, you noted this quarter-on-quarter decline on high single-digits to PS revenues. I was wondering if you could frame it a little differently sequentially. How should we be thinking about units versus ASPs? And correct me if I\u2019m wrong here, but from your comments, it sounded like the size of the partner benefits to margins was roughly $100 million, which was onetime. Can you give us some color on that? And I have a follow-up. Marie Myers : Yes. So just a couple of comments to help you then on the sequential on PS. So as I mentioned, we do see that single-digit sequential decline on PS revenue driven primarily, as I mentioned, around both the ongoing supply chain challenges and the Russia-Ukraine situation, which we also, I think, commented in my prepared remarks. So that\u2019s what\u2019s guiding the revenue. Then on the op margin, as I mentioned earlier, there were some partner benefits from our Personal Systems partners. They\u2019re onetime in nature. Now if you basically sort of exclude those in Q1, that you would get back to basically the PS margin range being at the high end of the range, which is where we anticipate we will \u2013 what the results will look like the Q2. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thanks, Marie. And Enrique, if I could. If we look at sort of a broader picture of what is happening with units, we\u2019re starting to see a decline on a year-on-year basis. And it aligns fully with your comments on the comps being extremely tough from last year. Why should investors not be concerned that this deceleration in units is a leading indicator of an eventual compression of ASPs in Print, but also on the PC side? Thank you. Enrique Lores : Well, in the \u2013 thank you. In the case of Print, really shipments this quarter are really totally determined by availability of supply. So, I really wouldn\u2019t read anything on declines of volumes because this is really totally driven by how many printers we and the rest of the market has been able to produce because it\u2019s not \u2013 has not been an HP situation, it has heavily been an industry situation. In the case of Personal Systems, our view and the rest of the industry is that the size of the market this year will be in the 340 million to 350 million units. This is what it was a few months ago and continues to be. We also said that we expect the demand to shift towards commercial. This is what we have seen this quarter. And actually, if you look at our numbers, we grow significantly in both Windows-based PCs and commercial PCs, in many cases, above 20%. So it\u2019s happening what we told the market it was going to happen. And when we look now at the funnel not only in backlog but at the funnel of opportunities we have for the second half in \u2013 for the rest of the year in commercial continues to be very strong. Operator : The next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Erik Woodring : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I think, I want to just follow up on that question and really just ask about the sustainability of PC ASPs. And I ask because I imagine your ability to leverage pricing gets more difficult as we move later into the year and supply improves plus you obviously face more difficult pricing comps. And so maybe just to dig down a little bit more. So, how should we think about maybe PC pricing versus units in the second half of this year? Any color that you can share there? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Enrique Lores : Yes. I think the evolution of pricing is really going to be determined by the difference between supply and demand. As I mentioned before, there are areas where the demand-supply, there is more balance between demand and supply like low-end consumer. And therefore, there, we expect to see more price competition. There are other areas like premium, like commercial, where really still demand is above supply, where we expect to continue to maintain the ability to price that we have had until now. And all these factors are built into the guide that we provided. I think it\u2019s also important to highlight that within the Personal Systems side, we continue to see very high growth opportunities in the growth area that we have identified on both gaming, peripheral, workplace solutions are really growing in a very strong way, which also gives confidence in our ability to continue to grow in a sustainable way. Erik Woodring : Awesome, I appreciate that. And then maybe just as my follow-up, you guys have committed to doing $5 billion of buybacks this year. But if I look back over the last quarters, you\u2019ve done more than $1.5 billion of buybacks on average each quarter. So maybe why shouldn\u2019t we think about buybacks and the rest of this fiscal year being \u2013 or for the total of this fiscal year being closer to $5 billion or $6 billion? And if they \u2013 if $4 billion is a target, would that imply or should we be thinking about buybacks slowing down into the remainder of the year? Thanks. Enrique Lores : Well, I have to clarify because you mentioned $5 billion. Our goal and what we have said is that we will buy at least $4 billion of shares, and this continues to be our plan. So this is what I would build in your model. Yes, we bought more this quarter but our goal is to complete their value plan as we declared it three years ago and $4 billion is the minimum we need to do. Operator : The next question comes from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead. David Vogt : Great. Thank you guys and thanks for taking the question. So my first question is, can you give us some more clarity on sort of the price increases that you pushed through on the printing side? I think earlier this year, kind of what the market reaction has been and the likelihood of that sticking as supply comes online as we move through the rest of this year. And I\u2019ll just give you my second question as well, is when you think about backlog, I think you mentioned it\u2019s primarily commercial and high-end consumer. Can you just kind of give us an update on where Chromebook sits in that backlog and how we should think about potentially Chromebook becoming a bigger part of the backlog as we move into, let\u2019s say, the fall and next year\u2019s holiday season and kind of the prospects for Chromebook becoming a bigger part of the business in the second half of the year? Thanks. Enrique Lores : Let me take those questions. In the case of Print, I think we should differentiate hardware versus supply. In the case of hardware, the current shipments are so limited by supply that it had to read any implication on pricing because really what has been driving the number of units we have shipped is the number of units we have been able to produce. We are shipping everything we build. In the case of supplies where we also drive price increases, I think what is important to highlight is that for both ink and toner, despite the price increases, we were able to grow share, which I think is a very important metric that shows that the \u2013 from a volume perspective, we haven\u2019t seen any negative impact on driven by the price increase. Marie Myers : To Enrique\u2019s point, our full year guide actually contemplates also those price increases as well. Enrique Lores : And then your question on Chromebooks, let me \u2013 as I did a quarter ago, let me remind that Chromebook is a relatively small part of our business. We already said a quarter ago that the backlog for Chromebooks has been basically totally reduced. We are expecting demand for Chromebooks to start growing as we had seen in previous years, in the Q2, Q3 time frame. But at this point, we have enough availability of components on that side that we \u2013 and we don\u2019t expect backlog to grow in that space. David Vogt : And just quickly, that\u2019s embedded in your PSG margin sort of a growth in the Chromebook business as we move through the year as well? Enrique Lores : Yes. All of it is built into the guide and into the margin projections that we have, of course. Operator : The next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Great. Hi, thanks for taking my question. If I can just start on Print first. In the commercial segment, Enrique, you mentioned the ongoing recovery in the office print business as well as the market share increases. Was really curious because I think even when we talk to one of your smaller competitors in the commercial print market, they talk about share increases. So if you can dive into that a bit more, what\u2019s driving the share increase, particularly as you remain supply constrained, what drives longer-term share increases for HP in the commercial print business? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Enrique Lores : Yes, sure. My comment on share increases was specifically on supply, which as we heard a couple of years ago, is a big part of our strategy on supply. And what we have been doing during the last two years is to execute on the toner side, on the commercial printers, the same strategy that we had implemented on home printers for ink for previous years. And this is a combination of marketing efforts, it\u2019s a combination of technology that we built in the printer, it\u2019s the combination of improving the quality of supplies. And as a result of all of that, we are driving \u2013 we have been able to reverse a trend that we had in the past of losing share in toner. And as we have been sharing during the last quarters now, we are growing share of toner again. So that\u2019s the \u2013 this is what I meant. In the case of hardware, there were also some improvements from a share perspective. But again, this is just driven by availability of supply. When we have supply, there is demand, and we\u2019re able to ship more. Samik Chatterjee : Got it, got it. And for my follow-up, I think this might be more for Marie, but the PS margins, I think, for the quarter, you mentioned you\u2019ll be \u2013 once we exclude the partner benefits, you\u2019ll be at the high end of the range that you specified, 5% to 7%. But how do we think about the higher cost of components or supply in that number? I\u2019m just trying to think about, does that moderate as you go through the year or you take some supply actions? Is that going to drive that higher component cost to process for longer? How should I think about it? Thank you. Marie Myers : Yes. So with respect to our margin ranges for the rest of the year, we basically calibrated our ability to be able to reprice for commodities. So, I think we\u2019ve done an excellent job of actually managing our pricing and really being able to deal with the volatility that we\u2019re seeing across commodities, logistics and then repricing that through the market. So our PS margin, we expect it to be at the high end of the range for the remainder of the year, and it reflects that. Enrique Lores : And I think this was our last question, so let me say thank you all for joining the call. As I said at the beginning of the call, we are really pleased with our start of the year. Clearly, the strategy that we have to modernize our core, expand into adjacencies and creating new businesses is growing, and this is reflected in the results that we posted today. And this, of course, gives us great confidence in our ability to grow revenue, operating profit, EPS and free cash flow in a sustained way. And today, before we leave, I want to invite all of you to join me in wishing Marie a very happy birthday because I am sure there is nothing better to do in her birthday than spending it with us in an earnings call. Marie, happy birthday. Marie Myers : Thank you, Enrique. Enrique Lores : And thank you, everybody, for joining. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Enrique Lores : Thanks, Orit, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. We are now halfway for our 2022 fiscal year, and I am proud of the results our teams have delivered as we continue building a stronger HP. But before I talk about our performance, I want to acknowledge the tragic events of the past few weeks. Last Tuesday, 19 children and two of their teachers were senselessly killed at a Texas elementary school. About a week earlier, 10 people were killed in a racially motivated attack in Buffalo. These horrific events and others like them are deeply disturbing and our hearts are with the communities who are bearing unimaginable loss right now. At the same time, we're also thinking about the people of Ukraine. More than three months into the war with Russia, the devastation and suffering across Ukraine is difficult to comprehend. So too is the situation facing the six million Ukrainian refugees. We continue to mobilize resources to support them. The HP Foundation has provided additional funding to support humanitarian relief across Central Europe. And we are donating a significant number of PCs to help refugees and their families, consistent with our global efforts to promote digital equity and education. Times like this are a painful reminder of how much work is still needed to create a more just future. And I believe it's incumbent upon companies to lead with purpose. These values have long been core to HP brand, and they will continue to guide us. Let me now turn to our results. When we held our Investor Day last October, I discussed our plans to continue our push to advance our leadership in our core markets, while creating a more growth-oriented portfolio by expanding its adjacencies and creating new businesses. I also highlighted the long-term secular trends we see propelling us forward, especially the rise of hybrid work and the exciting opportunities it creates across our broad portfolio. Our second quarter results show strong momentum in each of these areas. In the face of a volatile and dynamic macro environment, we executed well and grew revenue and non-GAAP EPS while returning capital to our shareholders. We are delivering on our commitment and our business is well positioned for sustainable long-term growth. For the quarter, revenue grew 4% year-over-year to $16.5 billion as we continue to see strong demand for HP technology and services. Non-GAAP EPS grew 16% year-over-year to $1.08. That's at the high end of our previously provided outlook. We generated $0.4 billion of free cash flow, and we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We remain committed to building a more growth-oriented portfolio. Our key growth businesses, which includes gaming, peripherals, Instant Ink, Workforce Solutions and Industrial Graphics and 3D collectively grew double-digits and delivered total revenue of $5.6 billion in the first half of fiscal 2022 and we are well on track to deliver on our $10 billion full year revenue target that we announced last October. We feel very good about these results. We mitigated the impact of higher commodity costs by implementing effective pricing strategies in both Print and Personal Systems while maintaining strong demand. And as we navigate the macro environment, we are making consistent progress on our strategic priorities and bringing strong innovation to market. This is reflected in our business unit performance. In Personal Systems, revenue grew 9% to $11.5 billion. This was our highest Q2 revenue ever, reflecting the durability of PC demand. We also delivered operating profit margin of 6.9% at the high-end of our target range. We are managing our PS portfolio with great discipline focused on driving profitable revenue growth more than units. Our continued mix shift towards commercial and premium combined with our pricing strategy allowed us to more than offset fewer unit shipments in the quarter. Increased spending on hybrid work solutions is driving strong commercial PC demand. Commercial revenue grew 18% driven by double-digit growth in Windows-based notebooks, desktops and workstations. And commercial was trending up to 65% of our peer revenue mix in the quarter. In Consumer, while the market has seen some signs of softening demand, it still exceeded pre-pandemic levels. There are pockets of growth in areas like premium and gaming that we are most focused on. And we are driving continued growth in peripherals, which grew more than 40% this quarter. Our supply chain actions also continue to have a positive impact. We reduced our backlog quarter-over-quarter. While the backlog remains elevated, particularly in commercial, we believe the actions we are taking will drive continued improvement. And as we prioritize operational execution, we are equally focused on strengthening our portfolio. During the quarter, we entered into an agreement to acquire Poly. Once completed, we expect this transaction will strengthen our position in hybrid work solutions and accelerate our growth in peripheral and workforce solutions. Since the announcement was made, we have received very positive feedback from reseller partners and commercial customers about the opportunity ahead. Our integration planning efforts are well underway. And we are working closely with the Poly team to prepare for a smooth transition upon deal close. We look forward to welcoming the Poly team into HP later this year. Turning to Print, we continue to operate in a components and logistics constrained environment, and performance was also impacted by the macro events this quarter. As a result, Print revenue declined 7% in the quarter, and our order backlog remained elevated in Q2. We expect supply chain dynamics to improve but continued shortages, especially in application-specific integrated circuit will impact print for the remainder of the year. We are actively working with our partners to mitigate the risks by executing on dual sourcing whenever possible and redesigning safety boards and components in our printers. We are also managing prices with great discipline, and we delivered another quarter of solid profitability. Our Print operating profit margin was 19.3%, our second consecutive quarter above our target range. Print consumer demand remained solid despite some softening in Europe. And we made important progress on two strategic objectives rebalancing system profitability and growing our subscription business. We have seen strong acceleration with HP plan and increased adoption in developed markets since launching last spring. In addition, we see strong growth on our profit upfront units, including our big tank model, especially in emerging markets. Big Tank revenue and units grew double digits year-over-year. We plan to continue expanding the Big Tank portfolio with new product launches of high-end platforms in the rest of our markets. Overall, HD+ and Big Tank printers have become a larger portion of our portfolio mix, representing 48% of printer shipments in the quarter. In consumer subscriptions, Instant Ink delivered another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue and cumulative subscribers. In commercial print, the Office segment continued to be impacted by supply availability as well as uncertainty around the timing of offices reopening. This was partially offset by our industrial graphics and 3D business growth. In Industrial Graphics, we delivered solid revenue growth and build a strong funnel continuing the positive trajectory we have seen in recent quarters. We had significant new installations of our latest Indigo digital presence. And I am particularly proud of the team's work for our customer, Hershey, as we created customized packaging to support their International Women's month campaign. We also delivered double-digit revenue growth in 3D printing. This quarter we announced a partnership with Legor Group, a leader in metals science and production for the luxury jewelry and fashion accessories market. This is an important milestone as we prepare to make metal yet more broadly available later this year. The progress we made in our first half of 2022 gives us confidence to raise our full year non-GAAP EPS outlook. And as we enter the second half, we will remain focused on disciplined execution in today's challenging and volatile macro environment. From a demand perspective, we expect to continue to see strong commercial demand with some softening of the consumer businesses. From a supply perspective, we see two quarters of constraints. First is the industry-wide component shortages that we expect will continue through fiscal 2022; second, are the COVID-related disruptions in China, which we expect will primarily impact fiscal Q3. We will also see an impact from the Russia-Ukraine war. Last February, we suspended shipments to Russia and Belarus across our portfolio and post our marketing and advertising activities. Considering the COVID environment and long-term outlook for Russia, we have decided to stop our Russia activity and have become the process of fully winding down our operations. Business there accounted for approximately $1 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2021. Marie will talk more about the financial aspects of our Russia plans. We remain committed to taking structural costs out of the business, and we are on track to meet our transformation cost targets. These actions combined with top line growth and effective working capital management give us confidence in achieving our free cash flow target. And we remain committed to our share repurchase plan of at least $4 billion in fiscal year 2022. The final point I'd like to make is that we are delivering on our financial commitments, while making progress against our sustainable impact strategy. Later this week, we will release our annual Sustainable Impact Report, outlining progress against climate action, human rights and digital equity goals. Let me give you a few examples. From 2019 to 2021, we achieved a 9% absolute reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions across HP's value chain. I am proud that we continue to decrease absolute emissions, while our net revenue increased by 8% during the same period. We have reduced single-use plastic packaging by 44% compared to 2018. And we have enabled better learning outcomes for over 74 million people globally since 2015 by providing curriculum, training and technology. I am inspired by the progress we are making toward becoming the world\u2019s most sustainable and just technology company. Not only are these the right things to do, they are also differentiating our brand and helping to drive our business. To sum up, this quarter caps off a strong first half of 2022. We are building a more growth-oriented portfolio, while also operating with great discipline and agility in the face of macro challenges. The environment will remain dynamic in the second half. We are not immune to these challenges, but our strong performance and momentum through the first two quarters gives us confidence to increase our full year non-GAAP EPS outlook. We are equally confident in our free cash flow outlook for the year, and we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and continuing to return capital to shareholders, while investing in the business to build a stronger HP. I will stop here and let Marie provide a closer look into our financial and outlook. Marie Myers : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. It's great to connect with you again. As Enrique highlighted, we have continued to build on our progress here in Q2, executing on our strategy, delivering solid results, returning significant capital to shareholders and investing both organically and inorganically to drive long-term value creation. Overall demand remained solid, driven by the strong secular tailwinds we see propelling our businesses forward, and we continue to execute on our objectives despite ongoing supply chain and logistics challenges and new macro impacts from the recent round of COVID-related lockdowns in China and the Russia-Ukraine war. Overall, I am pleased with how our teams are meeting these challenges head on and remain confident in our execution, as we navigate this evolving macro environment. Let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was $16.5 billion in the quarter, up 4% nominally and 5% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas increased 1%, EMEA increased 7% and APJ increased 10%. Gross margin was 20.2% in the quarter, down 1.5 points year-on-year. The decrease was primarily driven by proportionally higher Personal Systems mix and higher costs, including commodities, partially offset by favorable pricing net of currency. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion or 11.4% of revenue, down 5%. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily driven by lower R&D due to last years ramp-up in investments and lower variable compensation, including sales commission. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.4 billion, and non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $74 million for the quarter. At the key segment level, operating profit grew 6%. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.15 or 16% to $1.08 with a diluted share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $152 million, primarily related to restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges and other tax adjustments, partially offset by non-operating retirement-related credits, as a result, Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.94. Now let's turn to segment performance. In Q2, Personal Systems revenue was $11.5 billion, up 9% and up 11% in constant currency. Total units were down 17%, driven by ongoing supply chain challenges, lower per unit and the overall macro environment. Despite this, we grew revenue, reflecting the strength of Windows demand, our mix shift towards higher-value commercial categories like mainstream premium and mobile workstation and favorable pricing. Furthermore, to highlight some of the secular tailwinds we have seen in Personal Systems versus pre-pandemic our commercial notebook mix, excluding Chrome, now represents over 60% of our commercial unit mix, up 15 points versus Q2 2019. And in gaming, revenue has grown by over 140% versus Q2 2019. These are significant structural changes in our business. Drilling into the details, Commercial revenue was up 18% year-on-year and consumer revenue was down 6% year-on-year. By product category, revenue was up 3% for notebooks, 28% for desktops and 21% for workstations. We also continue to see strong performance across our key growth areas; including peripherals, gaming and workforce solutions with even more opportunities to drive growth ahead of us. Personal Systems delivered almost $800 million of operating profit with operating margins of 6.9%. Our Personal Systems business has grown operating profit dollars in 17 of the last 18 quarters. This consistent performance is indicative of our strong portfolio, the strong secular tailwinds we continue to see and our ability to deliver results in very different environments. Operating margin improved 0.2 points, primarily due to product mix, favorable pricing and lower OpEx including lower R&D spend due to last years investments ramp-up, partially offset by higher commodity costs in currency. Sequentially, operating margin declined 0.9 points, driven by higher OpEx due to R&D investment, more competitive pricing in several segments of consumer, partially offset by lower commodity and logistics costs. In print, our results reflected our focus on execution and the strength of our portfolio as we navigate the current environment. In Q2, total print revenue was $5 billion, down 7% and down 6% in constant currency, driven by lower print hardware units and lower supplies revenue. This was partially offset by higher hardware ASPs and growth in industrial graphics and services. Total hardware units declined 23%, largely due to continued component and logistics constraints, which we now expect to extend at least through 2022. By customer segment, Commercial revenue declined 4% on a decrease of 17% in units and Consumer revenue was down 12% with units down 24%. Home Print demand remains solid. However, revenue across both home and office was again constrained by available supply. In Q2, the commercial recovery, particularly in the office segment, continued to be impacted by the slower-than-expected return to the office. We did see, however, solid growth in industrial graphics and 3D as Enrique mentioned. We continue to expect a gradual and uneven recovery in Commercial over time, with the overall office market returning to approximately 80% of its pre-pandemic TAM, as we have discussed previously. Supplies revenue was $3.1 billion, declining 6% in constant currency year-on-year. We continue to expect for FY 2022 and over the long-term, Supplies will decline in the mid- to low single-digit range, consistent with the outlook provided at our Analyst Day. In Q2, the decline was driven primarily by continued normalization in home printing as expected, partially offset by the gradual recovery in both office and industrial print. Supplies revenue was also impacted by the China lockdowns and the Russia-Ukraine war. Adjusting for these impacts, supplies revenue was down approximately 4% in constant currency. As part of our contractual business, our Instant Ink services continued its momentum, once again delivering double-digit increases in both cumulative subscriber growth and revenue, while monthly churn continues to remain low at approximately 1%. Operating profit was approximately $1 billion, up $7 billion and operating margin was strong at 19.3%. Operating margin increased 1.4 points, driven by favorable mix and pricing, combined with lower OpEx as a result of lower variable compensation, including sales commissions, partially offset by lower volumes. Now, let's move to our transformation efforts where we have made strong progress and are on track to deliver $1.2 billion in gross run rate structural cost reductions by year-end. Our transformation continues to create new capabilities and long-term value creation. For our sales teams and partners, we have accelerated the selling cycle by transforming the way we configure price and quote HP Solutions for our customers worldwide. Utilizing advanced analytical pricing capabilities with a cloud-based platform, we have enabled the delivery of competitive quotes for HP Solutions in a quarter of the time, delivering a faster and more efficient customer sales experience. Lastly, we continue to optimize our real estate footprint, including 15 real estate actions in the first half of 2022. We are rebuilding and modernizing our key locations, focusing on collaboration hybrid work for our employees. A great example of this is our accelerated actions in Korea to both consolidate our sites and open a new state-of-the-art office and R&D facility, bringing together most of our employees in Korea. Now, let's move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q2 cash flow from operations and free cash flow was $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively. The cash conversion cycle was minus 26 days in the quarter, a sequential decline of seven days. So free cash flow and the sequential decline in cash conversion days were driven primarily by the decrease in Personal Systems volume and back-end loaded revenue linearity, driven by supply chain delays. Looking ahead to the second half of 2022, we expect to improve our cash conversion cycle by fiscal year-end. Driving our outlook is our expectations for Personal Systems volumes to recover in Q4, which I will provide more color on in a moment. And other operational improvements in our cash conversion cycle, including reduced inventory. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our free cash flow guidance of at least $4.5 billion for 2022. Strong capital returns remain a key part of our capital allocation strategy. In Q2, we returned approximately $1.3 billion to shareholders. This included approximately $1 billion in share repurchases and $262 million in cash dividends, and we remain on track to exceed our $16 billion return of capital target by year-end. Looking forward to Q3 and the rest of FY 2022, we continue to navigate supply availability, logistics constraints, inflation, pricing dynamics and the evolving macro environment, while continuing to deliver on our commitments. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our Q3 and overall financial outlook. We are once again raising our full year non-GAAP outlook for FY 2022 as we navigate through a challenging macro environment. We expect currency to be about a 2% year-over-year headwind in both Q3 and for FY 2022, reflecting the recent strength of the US dollar. With regard to the financial impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and the recent lockdowns in China, we are factoring in our best assumptions at this time, recognizing that conditions remain fluid and highly uncertain, with impacts to our top and bottom line results. Regarding Russia, as Enrique mentioned, we have made the decision to stop our activity there and have begun the process of fully winding down our operations. At FY 2021, Russia accounted for approximately $1 billion in revenue. In China, we expect to see a reopening and easing of restrictions from the recent lockdowns beginning in June. For Personal Systems, we continue to see solid demand and pricing for our PCs in commercial with some softening of demand in consumer, driven in part by the macro factors I mentioned earlier, including currency. We expect year-over-year Personal Systems revenue growth through the second half of 2022 with a continued shift towards higher-value categories, including commercial, premium and peripherals. With regard to our Personal Systems supply chain, while we expect to see a gradual improvement in the supply environment, we did experience a supplier-specific disruption late in Q2. That we expect will resolve by the end of Q3, resulting in a sequential decline in Personal Systems revenue in Q3 and a rebound in Q4, more in keeping with typical seasonality. We expect PS margins to remain near the high end of our 5% to 7% long-term range, particularly in Q3. In Print, we expect solid demand in consumer, favorable pricing, disciplined cost management and further normalization and mix as commercial gradually improves through 2022. With regard to print supply chain, we expect similar to Q2, composed shortages and logistics delays to constrain revenue. We expect these conditions to continue at least through 2022, but with some improvement into the latter part of the year. We expect group margins to be at the high end of our 16% to 18% range for FY 2022. For Q3 specifically, given continued hard work constraints, we expect print margin to be above our 16% to 18% range. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook. We expect third quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.08. And third quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.91 to $0.96, which includes an incremental GAAP-only charge of approximately $0.04 related to the wind down of operations in Russia. We expect FY 2022 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.24 to $4.38. And FY 2022, GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.93. For FY 2022, we expect our free cash flow to be at least $4.5 billion. We have made excellent progress against our priorities in the first half of fiscal 2022. And I am confident in our ability to continue to deliver on our second half outlook while investing the long-term sustainable growth. I'll stop here so we can take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will be from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Krish Sankar : Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong results and execution in a tough environment. My first question is for Enrique, and then I have a follow-up for Marie. Enrique, on the PC business, it makes sense, commercial is strong. But it looks like desktop did much better than notebooks, both in terms of revenue and units. Can you just help us understand what's happening in commercial between desktop and notebook? And any view on PC TAM, unit TAM for this year? Your competitors spoke about 330 million units, kind of curious what your view is. And then I have a quick follow-up for Marie on inventory. Thank you. Enrique Lores : Sure. Thank you. Let me start with desktops and actually same happened with workstations. The growth this quarter is really helped from an easy compare last year. If you remember last year, not many companies were investing in equipment for the office. This drove the sales of desktops and workstations down. And now we are seeing the opposite effect as some of this investment is coming back. I think on the overall PC market, the important thing to have in mind is the strength of the demand on the commercial side. We are seeing this across the board, across all geographies, and this is especially true on high configurations given the new use models that PCs are going to have. And this is why even if for the year, going now to the second part of your question, we expect the overall PC market in terms of units to decline slightly. This is very similar to what other analysts and other companies have shared. From a revenue perspective, we see growth really driven by mix as commercial will become bigger, premium categories within commercial will be bigger. And also as premium consumer and gaming will become a more relevant part of the market. Krish Sankar : Got it, Enrique. Follow-up for Marie on inventory. Last quarter, you said you're not planning to decrease inventory, and it's kind of elevated in terms of inventory days. Can you give us some color on how much of it is finished goods or raw materials and components? How much of it is actually buildup of materials versus cost inflation? Any kind of color on inventory would be very helpful. Thank you very much Marie Myers : Sure, and good afternoon, Christian, and thanks for your question. So from a sequential perspective, our inventory actually declined, and that was due to in-transit offset by higher commodity costs due to supply constraints. Now in terms of both print and PS, a couple of different dynamics. So let me give you some color. So -- on the Print side, it's really driven by the assurance of supply, given the ongoing supply constraints that we're seeing on the print side and also just the longer lead and transit times. And then in PS, what's going on there is really the shift in motor transport. So -- as you might recall, I think we made this comment in our last call that we stopped using the train that we have used extensively from China to Europe, and we shifted a lot more of PS onto the ocean we've seen that shift from air to ocean. So that's what you're seeing. And then obviously, sea shipments are really for economic value and really drive much better pass-through, a lot better cost for us. So that's hopefully the perspective on inventory for you. Enrique Lores : We have said in the past, our medium-term plan is to continue to reduce own inventory. We think we have an opportunity there. And with the component situation getting better, we really think that this is going to be our plan during the next quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thank you very much for taking the questions and congrats on the good execution in the quarter. Two questions, one and one follow-up. First, I'm just curious, Enrique and Maria, if you could kind of dive a little bit deeper into the commercial backlog in the PC segment. What's your expectations of working that backlog down? Is your guidance assuming that you continue to have an elevated backlog? Any kind of commentary on how we should think about the trajectory of that backlog through the back half of this fiscal year. Enrique Lores : Yes. So thank you. So as we said in the prepared remarks, commercial backlog, commercial PC backlog and especially commercial continues to be elevated. Our plan is to reduce that during the coming quarters, and we will continue to improve the situation from a supply chain perspective. And by the end of the year or early next year, should be -- we should be done with that. Aaron Rakers : Yes Okay. That's helpful. And then the follow-up question is just looking at the pricing trends you're seeing within PSG. Could you help us appreciate how much of it is being mix driven versus your ability to pass through increased pricing from components and logistics? I'm just curious if you can help us understand the effects of pricing. Marie Myers : Yes. No, I'd say, first of all, we definitely benefited from favorable pricing. And I think we've made those comments over the last couple of quarters. And really, it's due to that supply and demand imbalance that we've been experiencing. And I'd say particularly on the PS side, we've been able to actually pass-through a lot of that inflationary pricing straight through into our products. Now, I would just add, if the supply and demand starts to come back into closer alignment, we'll start to see some of that pricing normalize. But right now, in terms of just the current outlook, we really expect pricing to remain strong in the second half of the year. Enrique Lores : And in terms of your comment about mix, mix has also a significant impact on pricing. And really, when we -- you need to think about mix, you need to think about the new use models for PCs. PCs are more-and-more used as communication tools, which means customers need more memory, better cameras, better audio. And this is really driving demand towards the richer categories and the more premium products and is really having a significant impact on the overall price -- on pricing. Marie Myers : Yeah. I should add. Just on the mix comment actually, this quarter, around 65% of our PS portfolio is commercial, which obviously, as you know, has higher ASPs. So it's a combination of both, the mix and the rate, which is really driving that favorability in pricing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. And congrats on a good quarter. Mine as well I guess I have two as well. The first one is, just on the Print side, and I think your operating margin performance there was really impressive in the April quarter. So, maybe you could just talk about, what is enabling this really strong 19% plus operating margin performance in April, despite the supply [Indiscernible] that you had? And then, as you think about the back half, it doesn't seem like mix is getting any different versus what you have in April. So, why would margins dip down based on what you said, on the Print side? Enrique Lores : Yeah. So the performance of the Print business this quarter was really driven by supply. We continue to see demand significantly above supply. And in supply, we are impacted mostly by component availability. And therefore, our focus was on really profit optimization through pricing, through allocation of units. And this is why profitability this quarter was so strong. As we shared before, we expect the supply situation to improve through the end of the year. And as we -- this will happen we also expect that pricing will be normalized, as Marie just explained. Marie Myers : Yeah. Maybe I'll just add some comments then on Q3 on the print rate and what we expect to happen. As we've said, we expect for the full year that would be at the high-end of that range. And in fact actually what we're expecting in Q3 it actually would be slightly above that. And really what that's driven by is a combination of the supply constraints that Enrique spoke about, some of the mix that we're starting to see as the office reopens. And then, given that backdrop, we're still seeing the impact of that favorable pricing, I just spoke about a moment ago, so we'll expect some of that to come through. And obviously, we're doing all of that, while we're offsetting currency headwinds as well. So overall, we would expect the rate for Print to certainly in the year be at the high-end of that long-term range. Amit Daryanani : Understood. And then, if I could just ask you around the non-GAAP adjustments that are being made for the fiscal 2022 guide. I understand you're raising the non-GAAP numbers, but the GAAP numbers that are coming down. So I think the adjustments are $0.45 this time, 90 days ago, that was $0.31. Maybe I don't understand this enough, but could you just talk about what is resulting or what are the incremental adjustments that are being made? Is it restructuring? Is it Russia? And if you could just break that down, that would be helpful. Marie Myers : Sure, happy to do so. So, we actually revised our FY 2022 GAAP guidance. And we actually have $0.11 just to clarify at the midpoint. So let me walk you through these really four key items that are driving it, which you captured a couple in your comments. So first of all, with the acquisition-related charges, related to Poly. As you know, we announced that just a little while ago, so that wasn't included in our prior GAAP guidance. Secondly, there are charges with Russia, which we actually -- I spoke about I think in my prepared remarks. And then we also have the timing acceleration of some real estate actions related to our transformation. And then finally, we've got some onetime related tax adjustments as well. So that's basically the construct for the revised GAAP guide. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. Thank you for taking the question. I have two as well. I just want to understand the backlog dynamics that happened in the quarter and what you're expecting going forward. So, I think you said you drew down backlog in PCs was book-to-bill and revenues positive in the quarter? Can you give us some sense of how much backlog drawdown there was in PCs? And was there any backlog drawdown in printing? And when we think about the remainder of the year, if there's a supplier disruption in PCs, why would you expect to be able to continue to draw down backlog in Q3? And I have a follow-up, please. Enrique Lores : Sure. So, as I commented before, Toni, we saw a reduction of backlog Q2 -- Q1 to Q2, visibly driven by the ability to ship some of the units at the -- and increase some of the volumes in some specific areas. As we look out through the end of the year, we expect the supply situation to improve, and therefore, we expect to continue to reduce backlog in the rest of the year. In the case of print, we continue to operate also with a high level of backlog. The reduction there was smaller. And we expect that we will be able to start reducing that more significantly in the Q4 timeframe, which is where we have visibility of some of the actions we have taken in supply chain to take more impact. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. Thank you. But I'm still not quite clear why, if you have a supplier constraint and you're expecting lower revenues in Q3 from PCs, why you think you'll draw down backlog? And can I also just get you to clarify typically, seasonally, Printing is down Q2 to Q3. I think you're saying PCs will be down Q2 to Q3. Is that what we should expect? And again, if we -- if you're drawing down backlog, that feels a lot lower. Typically, you're up 4% sequentially from Q2 to Q3. So again, I'm just trying to square the circle with your anticipated backlog drawdowns and the dynamics of having weaker than seasonal PC revenues in Q3? Thank you. Enrique Lores : Yes. So, the comment about growing backlog is more a second half quarter \u2013 a second half comment. Specifically, in Q3 we have identified a very specific problem with one of our PC component supplier that is, having some special issues on yield in one other factory. This is going to be impacting our shipments in Q3 for PC. We have line of sight for this to be recovered in Q4. And this is why from a seasonality perspective, revenue in Personal Systems in PC in Q3 will be below Q2. And again, the backlog coming in a second half comment, not a quarter-over-quarter comment. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Erik Woodring : Awesome. Thank you for the quarter -- excuse me, thank you for the question. Congrats on the quarter. If we take a step back, it's been a pretty unique time in the market, kind of the best PC growth in the decade plus short supply, which has allowed you to hold pricing. And then, at the same time, you've been able to work through a multiyear cost-cutting kind of transformation program, and it's clearly showing up in your margin profile, right, pre-kind of COVID period operating margins were around 7% to 7.5%. Right now, they're running around 9% consistently. So, just curious kind of -- is there a way that you can break down the margin uplift between kind of mix and kind of the permanency of the changes that you've made versus temporary factors like pricing that you expect to potentially normalize in the back half of the year and into next year? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Enrique Lores : Sure. Probably the best way to answer, Erik, is to go back to the guidance we provided in our Investor Day in October, where we share, what is our perspective for both businesses. In the case of Personal Systems, we expect margins to be between 5% and 7% going forward. We raised that in October from what we had before to reflect, especially the impact of the cost activities that we have put in place, and also the focus that we had in higher margin categories. And I like to remind you that several of our growth areas like gaming, peripheral and services in the case of PC will help us to sustain these higher margins. In the case of print, our margins -- our projection is that margins will stay in the 16% to 18% range. And again, our long-term strategy is really focused on those categories where we think we can drive both growth and sustainable margins. While at the same time, we expect that some of the pricing benefits we have experienced during the last two years will fade over time. Erik Woodring : Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Enrique. And then maybe a question on Print. Go back to SAM 2019, you laid out this business model pivot for the printing business to collect more profits upfront from the sale of printing hardware, while at the same time introducing programs like HP+ to make supplies stickier in certain situations. So, we're now more than two years away from that announcement. Can you just kind of give us an update on where we are on this pivot? How much is left to do, kind of what inning we're in? And then, really how a normalization and kind of supply and demand and pricing dynamics could change or alter your ability to kind of capture some of these higher hardware prices that you've been able to do over the last, call it, two years and change. Thanks. Enrique Lores : Sure. Thank you. We are very pleased with the program that we are doing in the pivot of the business model. We shared today that today, in Q2, around 48% of the units are either what we call profit upfront, so customers get a printer and the ink or toner when they get the unit or HP+ unit. So this gives you an idea of the progress that we have made in the last two years, and we expect this percentage to continue to increase as the adoption for HP plants will continue to grow. Another important element of our strategy is the growth of our subscription model. And also, we shared today that in Q2 that business both from subscribers and from a revenue perspective, we grew double digit. So this also shows the momentum that we have in that part of the company. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thank you. I have some pretty easy specific questions, one for Enrique and one for Marie. Enrique, I believe it was a year ago, you highlighted the strength in Chromebook's from HP. Now will we -- can you help us kind of quantify how much exposure you have to PC because now the world, of course, is opposite of the view of strength for Chromebook's. Just want to see the risk there? And then for Marie, is the reason why we're not increasing free cash flow is that as a function of those four items that you mentioned on the adjustments of the Russia, the closing costs, non-GAAP tax adjustments and things like that? Thank you. Enrique Lores : Yeah. Thank you, Jim. So the exposure -- the size of the overall Chromebook business is relatively small in our Personal Systems business. It lends 10% from a revenue perspective and much smaller from an operating profit or margin perspective. So the exposure that we have is relatively small. Shipments of Chromebook this quarter were also small. So this shows that we can really perform in a very strong way of Personal Systems even in there, we have very small Chromebook market. What we have seen during this year, and we started to see it a few quarters ago, and we have talked about this before is a significant slowdown of the Chromebook business in the US in the education segment, we are starting to see some signs of recovery, but the market has continued to be significantly below where it was a year ago. Marie Myers : Jim, good morning. Just on your comments on free cash flow, just to clarify. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do expect to generate at least $4.5 billion in free cash flow this year. So we remain very much on track. And with respect to the items that I explained on the GAAP guide in terms of their impact on cash flow, the impacts that we had in the quarter were really much more related to PS volumes in the back-end loaded revenue linearity. As you heard Enrique say earlier, we expect that to course correct in Q4. So at this point, we expect our cash flow to remain on track for our guide. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : Yeah. Hey, good afternoon guys. Congrats on the results and strong execution in an increasingly challenging environment. Two, if I could, have you guys seen any impact to any of your commercial business for macro? And are you getting any feedback yet if you've not seen any impact yet, are you getting any feedback yet from customers about what they're thinking? And then I have a follow-up as well. Thanks. Enrique Lores : Thank you, Ananda. So the answer is not yet. We haven't -- we continue to see strong demand on the commercial side. We have a strong funnel. So we don't see any signals of weakening of the demand on the commercial side. And this is one of the key drivers of the guide that we have provided for the rest of the year. Ananda Baruah : Enrique, that's really helpful. And then, Enrique, just moving over to the PC business quickly. How much -- I believe that 90 days ago, sort of, 90 days ago, 180 days ago, you guys are thinking that the market, PC market would be up flat to slightly up for the year. So now sounds like slightly down for the year. Is that accurate by recollection? And if it is, is the change -- how much is supply chain related coming out of China with the lockdown? And how much of it is demand related? And then the second part to that is you gave us your view on the market. How are you expecting HP to perform unit-wise this year as well? Thanks. And that\u2019s it for me. Enrique Lores : Yeah. So two things. One is, from a unit perspective, we expect this year to see a small decline from where the market was in 2021, but to stay at a very elevated level compared to 2019. In terms of units, we expect the market to be in the 320 million, 330 million units in line with what many of the analysts and other companies have published. From a revenue perspective, though, we expect to see growth. We expect the market to grow in the 3% to 4%, really driven by many of the things we have been discussing today, mix between consumer and commercial and a mixed shift towards more premium units in both segments. And that's really what is driving the growth that we expect to see in Personal Systems through the rest of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. Your line is open. David Vogt : Great. Thank you. I have two quick questions, one for Enrique and then a quick follow-up for Marie. So Enrique, you -- both you and your competitors have noted that you're focused on higher-end PCs, including commercial, gaming and high-end consumer as a reason for sustainable growth and better ASPs and mix going forward. But I guess the question I have is the supply chains have started the typical buying pattern and the pricing backdrop how do we know that there is not risk to incremental buyers of PCs coming online when supply normalizes targeting more low-end devices, lower spec PCs give that there might have been some people lining up early in the queue for more richer configurations? And then I have a follow-up for Marie on margins. Enrique Lores : Well, I think the demand of both is fairly independent. We -- because of -- as I mentioned before, because of US model in commercial consumer customers need higher and better configurations because of a growth in gaming we see growth in that category, which in general has also higher average selling prices and this is driving the demand of this category. We continue to have a very strong glowing portfolio and if we see more demand on that side, we will be happy to serve it, but at this point, we really see demand on the more premium categories both in commercial and in consumer. David Vogt : Great. And then a quick follow up from Marie. Marie, thanks for all the color on the margin. Just to follow-up on margin. So you're well above your 16% to 18% range, not only this quarter but in the prior quarter, and then the guide for the third quarter. But if I just sort of analyze the full year guidance, are you intimating that by Q4 of this fiscal year, print margins return back towards the lower end of your long-term range? I'm doing the math correctly and if so is that sort of the way to think about the profitability of that segment going forward that this is sort of a onetime above the range period and that 16% to 18% is more likely the stable environment that we're going to be operating in for the foreseeable future? Marie Myers : Yes. No, David. Good afternoon. So I think the way to think about it for the full year is really that we expect to be at the high-end. As I mentioned a bit earlier, we expect it to be above for Q3 due to the supply chain constraints. But overall, just to kind of give you a little extra context here, we've seen that favorable pricing impact, and we believe the durability around that is there, plus you've seen us very successfully managed through the headwinds in the business, whether that was currency, with commodities, et cetera. And then Enrique talked today about the growth businesses and how we're driving that in terms of just the flow-through factor for a longer-term perspective. So that's the right way to think about our margin construct going forward. It's a combination of all of those factors coming together. But for the year, I really want you to leave with the thought that we're going to be at the high end of 2016 to 2018. Enrique Lores : Thank you, Marie, and thank you, everybody, for your questions today and for joining the call. I think the first six months of fiscal year 2022 show that our business continues to perform well and that we are entering the second half from a position of strength. I want to especially highlight the performance that we have had in our growth businesses. As I said at the beginning of the call, they represented $5.6 billion of business, well on track to deliver on the $10 billion goal that we shared with all of you in October. At the same time, we really show this gives us strong confidence as we enter in the second half. This is why we decided to raise our EPS guide for the year to reflect that confidence and we are really well positioned to deliver sustained revenue, operating profit, EPS and free cash flow. So really, thank you for joining today and looking forward to continue to speak to all of you soon. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session toward the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Orit Keinan-Nahon: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marie Myers, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is a webcast, and a replay will be available on our website shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the earnings release and accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at investor.hp.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available now and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2022, and HP's other SEC filings. During this webcast, unless otherwise specifically noted, all comparisons are year-over-year comparisons with the corresponding year-ago period. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Enrique. Enrique Lores : Thank you, Orit, and thanks to everyone who is joining the call today. As part of our earnings today, we will cover three important themes. First, we will talk about the unexpected and very abrupt shift in the macroeconomic environment and how this is challenging our overall business in the short term. Second, we will enumerate the decisive actions we are taking in response to this macroeconomic challenge, including continued progress in our structural cost reduction programs while we continue prioritizing our investments in growth areas. Third, we will convey that our confidence in the medium- and longer-term prospects of our markets and growth drivers remains intact. We are firmly committed to our strategy for sustainable, profitable growth over the long-term and disciplined capital return to shareholders. First, regarding the macroeconomic environment, like many companies, we are managing through some challenging market conditions with a focus on what we can control. Inflation increased in many parts of the world, and this led to lower consumer spending for our product categories. And demand in Europe worsened against the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine war. Although we highlighted pockets of consumer softness during our Q2 call, the environment deteriorated more rapidly late in the third quarter. The strength of our commercial business, particularly in the enterprise, helped us to partially offset declines in consumer demand. Still, the fact that we remain supply constrained did not allow us to fully rebalance. As a result, our net revenue was $14.7 billion in the quarter. That's down 4% nominally and 2% in constant currency year-over-year. Despite this, we were still able to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $1.04 in line with our previously provided outlook. This reflects our very disciplined cost management and pricing strategy as well as our continued ability to shift more of our portfolio to higher-growth, higher-value segments. And while we cannot control how the economic situation evolves in the coming months, there are some very clear actions we can take to mitigate the impact of near-term headwinds and drive continued progress against our long-term growth strategy. And we are taking a very measured approach with a focus on five clear priorities. First, we are optimizing our performance by staying disciplined in our pricing and increasing our focus on pockets of profitable growth, such as premium, peripherals, services and solutions. Second, given volatility is becoming the norm, we are focused on continuously improving the way we respond to it. We are taking decisive actions to address issues that have surfaced due to the abrupt changes we have seen in the industry. And we view this as an opportunity to further improve our ability to adapt to quick transitions in the market in the future. Third, we are doubling down on our growth portfolio while protecting our core business. Collectively, our key growth businesses once again grew double digits in Q3. And we remain on track to exceed our $10 billion revenue target for the full year. We expect our key growth businesses will continue to be a critical part of our growth strategy. Fourth, we are taking actions to reduce our variable spend and further reduce our structural cost by accelerating our digital transformation. We have already met or exceeded many of our objectives in our current transformation plan. And we're in the process of finalizing the foundation for a new multiyear transformation program that we plan to share with you during our Q4 call. And finally, we are maintaining our capital allocation strategy. In Q3, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders, and we expect to exceed our commitment to return $16 billion to shareholders as part of our value creation plan. These are the right areas of focus regardless of the macro environment. In times like this, they become even more important, and the actions we are taking will enable us to continue building a stronger HP. Let me now spend a few minutes discussing our Q3 business unit performance. In Personal Systems, revenue declined 3%, primarily driven by softening consumer demand for our categories and more price competition. In constant currency, PS revenue was flat in the quarter. We delivered operating profit margin of 6.9%. This is at the high end of our target range, driven by disciplined pricing and our mix shift to high-value segments and robust cost management. Within commercial, our Windows-based revenue grew approximately 18% with commercial premium and workstations up double digits. And commercial was more than 2/3 of our PS revenue mix in Q3. We are taking actions to optimize consumer performance, and we are focusing on pockets of growth across our portfolio, such as premium and peripheral, which grew double digits this quarter. We saw overall higher channel inventory levels in the quarter, and we expect pricing will become more aggressive in Q4 to address this. While this environment creates some near-term market uncertainty, our long-term view of the PC market and its adjacencies has not changed. And we have confidence in the trajectory of Personal Systems over time. One source of our confidence is our acquisition of Poly, which we closed yesterday. We are thrilled to welcome the Poly team to HP. Poly accelerates our expansion and scale in two key growth businesses, peripheral and workforce solutions. Poly devices and software, combined with HP's leadership across compute, device management and security creates a comprehensive portfolio of work solutions. We continue to receive very positive feedback from resellers, partners and commercial customers about the opportunity ahead. We expect the transaction will be accretive to non-GAAP EPS and in fiscal year '23. With the Poly deal completed, I am pleased to share that Dave Shull, Poly's former CEO, will be joining HP to lead a newly created workforce services and solutions organization. This is a big step forward for our business that will allow us to drive a more integrated and expansive commercial services growth agenda across Personal Systems and Print. Dave is a terrific executive with extensive global experience, and he will be a great addition to our leadership team. Let me now turn to our Print business. Like PS, consumer softness and supply constraints weighed on our results. Specifically, Print revenue declined 6% or 5% in constant currency, with supply revenue declining 9%. We delivered operating profit margin of 19.9%, which is well above our target range and reflects our disciplined pricing and cost management in a tough market as well as commercial hardware supply constraints. We also made progress against our plans to rebalance system profitability and accelerate in key growth areas. HP+ and Big Tank printers continue to become a larger portion of our portfolio mix, representing more than 50% of printer shipments in the quarter. And our strong focus on Big Tank in emerging markets allowed us to gain share. We delivered another quarter of double-digit revenue and cumulative subscriber growth in our consumer subscription business. This model is proving to be resilient, and its value proposition is even more attractive to consumers in this environment. Industrial graphics impressions also grew year-over-year, and we built a strong funnel with recovery in all segments. And we delivered double-digit revenue growth in as customers increase their deployment of our thermoplastic solutions. Across both Personal Systems and Print, we continue to drive an aggressive innovation agenda. Last week, we kicked off a global roadshow with our top channel partners. And I will tell you what I told them. We have built our strongest portfolio ever. We have introduced more than 100 new products and solutions over the past 18 months. Much of this innovation is being driven by the rise of the hybrid office. Our devices are what's enabling people to connect, create and collaborate across multiple locations and do it securely. Last week, we introduced our HP Instant Ink for small business and our new LaserJet Pro with HP+. This is an intuitive printing system that's tailor-made to meet the unique needs of small businesses by enabling greater productivity, effortless device management and advanced security. And in Personal Systems, we just unveiled our next-gen Dragonfly Folio, a beautiful PC that has been thoughtfully crafted for hybrid work. Enhanced by our HP Presence video conferencing solution, the Dragonfly's advanced camera capabilities, automatic voice leveling and background noise filtering technologies and digital temp create a superb remote work experience. The Dragonfly is also made using ocean-bound plastic and other recycled materials, which supports our overall commitment to sustainable impact. We continue to advance our efforts in this area. We announced last week a significant expansion of our HP Amplify Impact program, which mobilizes and rewards our channel partners as they make progress on their own sustainability and diversity goals. This work is differentiating our brand, motivating our people and strengthening our communities. Looking ahead, the macroeconomic environment remains challenging. Consumer softness is likely to continue in the near term. We also see some companies taking a more measured approach to their spending and new orders showing signs of softening demand in commercial categories. And although we have made significant progress on supply chain, some shortages remain. Given that we do not currently foresee an economic rebound in the short term, we believe the prudent thing to do is to adjust our Q4 outlook, which Marie will discuss in her remarks. But like all economic downturns, we also believe that the current situation is temporary. And just as market conditions deteriorated quickly, they could also rebound quickly. We have consistently proven our ability to manage the Company through up and down markets. We are prepared for multiple scenarios and ready to act as needed. Most importantly, the fundamentals from which our long-term strategy is built have not changed. Hybrid work is here to stay. Gaming will continue to grow in popularity. The rise of digital services and subscriptions is unlocking new business models. And industrial markets are being disrupted by new technologies. These are long-term secular trends. Each of them plays to HP's strength. And we are confident in our long-term growth targets even as we take the actions necessary to mitigate near-term headwinds. To give you additional insight into our performance and outlook, I'm going to pass it over to Marie. Marie Myers : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As Enrique mentioned, our Q3 results were impacted by macroeconomic challenges, including a significant slowdown in consumer demand in our categories : inflation, currency and geopolitical challenges. We took swift actions across the levers within our control to help address these headwinds, focusing on rigorous financial management in both our costs and our investments across our businesses. In addition, we are executing on our strategy and returning significant amounts of capital to shareholders. Disciplined financial management, particularly OpEx and cost management, is core to our DNA at HP, and we are confident in our ability to navigate adeptly in up and down market conditions. Furthermore, we continue to realize structural cost savings from our transformation program and see additional opportunities to drive significant cost reductions ahead of us. Despite these recent challenges, we remain confident in both our end markets and strategy to drive the long-term value creation. With that, let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was $14.7 billion in the quarter, down 4% nominally and 2% in constant currency. Approximately 2 points or half of the decline was due to the change in estimated sales and marketing incentives benefit in our prior year results. Gross margin was 19.8% in the quarter, down 2.4 points year-on-year, driven by the change in estimated incentives benefit in the prior year and currency. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.5 billion or 10.3% of revenue, down 20% year-on-year. In Q3, we installed further rigor in our cost management. We reduced our OpEx spend by over $370 million year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter by prioritizing our variable spend in R&D and marketing aligned with our growth categories. Lower variable compensation given the more challenging business environment was also a key driver. At the same time, we are making prudent and targeted investments where we anticipate significant opportunity to drive growth, including our key growth areas which I will touch upon in a few moments. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.4 billion, down 8%, and non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $104 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased 4% to $1.04 with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net benefit totaling $40 million, primarily related to non-operating retirement-related credits and other tax adjustments, partially offset by restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges and Russia exit charges. As a result, Q3 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $1.08. Now let's turn to segment performance. In Q3, Personal Systems revenue was $10.1 billion, down 3% and flat in constant currency. Total units were down 25% as a result of a decline in chrome demand as well as the rapid deterioration of demand late in the quarter, particularly in our consumer business. In addition, we continue to see ongoing supply chain constraints as expected in some pockets of PS. In spite of those challenges, there were several bright solid demand in our higher-value categories across commercial and consumer, consistent with our strategy. Commercial revenue constituted over 2/3 of our Personal Systems revenue in Q3, and our commercials Windows-based revenue grew approximately 18%, with units up 6%. Mobile workstation revenue was up approximately 60%. Consumer premium revenue was up 10%. The long-term secular tailwinds we continue to see in Personal Systems, including hybrid work, give us confidence in our long-term outlook. And regarding hybrid work, an area of focus, I want to give a warm welcome to our Poly team. We anticipate significant opportunity ahead from both a strategic and financial perspective, with clear opportunities to capitalize on both secular tailwinds and synergies to help drive long-term revenue and non-GAAP operating profit and EPS growth. I will cover the financial impact of Poly shortly. Let's drill into the details. Commercial revenue was up 7% year-on-year and up 11% in constant currency. Consumer revenue was down 20% year-on-year and down 18% in constant currency. FX was clearly a key factor in our results this quarter. As an example, currency was an approximate 5-point headwind to our Personal Systems business in EMEA this quarter. By product category, revenue was down 10% for notebooks, up 13% for desktops and up 38% for workstations. We also continued to perform well in many of our key growth areas, including peripherals and DAS, which was up strong double digits. Personal Systems delivered $695 million of operating profit with operating margins of 6.9%, flat sequentially as we continue to execute despite the headwinds I mentioned earlier. Operating margin declined 1.5 points year-on-year primarily due to currency and higher costs particularly in consumer, partially offset by lower OpEx, including lower R&D and variable compensation and improved commercial product mix. In Print, our results reflected our focus on execution and the breadth of our portfolio as we navigate the current environment. In Q3, total Print revenue was $4.6 billion, down 6% nominally and down 5% in constant currency, driven by lower supplies revenue and lower print hardware units. This was partially offset by higher home and office hardware ASPs and growth in industrial graphics and Instant Ink services. Total hardware units declined 3%, driven largely by lower-than-expected IC component availability and logistics constraints. While we have qualified additional suppliers and our Board redesigns are on track for product inclusion later this year, we still expect Print hardware constraints to extend into FY '23. By customer segment, commercial revenue declined 3% and down 1% in constant currency on unit declines of 15%. Consumer revenue was up 1% and 3% in constant currency with units down 1%. However, we saw some softening in home hardware demand sequentially, particularly on low-end units, impacting ASPs driven by the headwinds I described earlier. In Q3, commercial recovery continued to be impacted by the slow return to the office. In contrast, we did see solid growth in industrial graphics and 3D. In graphics, our flexible packaging business had another solid quarter and impressions have more than doubled versus pre-pandemic levels. Overall, we continue to expect a gradual and uneven recovery in commercial, with the overall office market returning to approximately 80% of its pre-pandemic TAM over time based on our current outlook. Supplies revenue of $2.8 billion declined 9% in constant currency. The decline was driven primarily by a significant reduction in consumer demand, driven by the challenging environment and continued normalization in home printing, partially offset by the gradual recovery in industrial print. The estimated impact of our decision to stop and permanently wind down our Russia business was approximately 1 point headwind to our supplies revenue year-on-year. Instant Ink services delivered another quarter of double-digit increases in both cumulative subscriber growth and revenue, continuing to highlight the success of this business model even in a tougher macro. Print operating profit was $911 million, up 6%, yielding an operating margin of 19.9%. Operating margin increased 2.3 points, driven by rate improvement in hardware and OpEx management particularly lower variable compensation, partially offset by unfavorable mix. Now let's move to our transformation efforts, where we had another strong quarter of progress and are on track to exceed our $1.2 billion in gross run rate structural cost reductions by fiscal year end. During Q3, we delivered on numerous fronts, driving cost reductions to help drive long-term value creation. In Q3, we took several actions to drive structural cost reductions across both our manufacturing and real estate footprint. We executed two significant actions intended to optimize our factory footprint, driving both efficiency and increased global resiliency across our ink and laser hardware and supplies manufacturing. In addition, we continue to optimize our real estate footprint with site exits or reductions. Year-to-date, we have now executed 23 site optimizations, including eight site exits, and our overall plan has now reached 90 site optimizations since the start of our transformation. Our efforts have established a strong foundation that we fully intend to build upon going forward. As Enrique mentioned, we are currently finalizing our next phase of digital transformation focused on further cost and efficiency opportunities and plan to provide an update during our Q4 earnings call. Now let's move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q3 cash flow from operations and free cash flow was $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. The cash conversion cycle was minus 29 days in the quarter, a sequential improvement of three days. Free cash flow and the sequential improvement in the cash conversion days came in below our expectations, driven primarily by the larger-than-expected sequential decrease in Personal Systems volume, delays in supply availability and unfavorable manufacturing linearity. And while we saw a meaningful improvement in our days of inventory in Personal Systems driven primarily by a decrease in commodities, these benefits were more than offset by higher days of Print inventory largely from assurance of supply and increased lead times. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect to see further improvement to our cash conversion cycle. Driving our outlook are our expectations for additional operational improvements, including further reductions to inventory levels, and we also expect some improvement in Personal Systems volume sequentially in Q4. Strong capital returns continue to be a key part of our capital allocation strategy. In Q3, we returned approximately $1.3 billion to shareholders. This included approximately $1 billion in share repurchases and $255 million in cash dividends. Since the start of our value plan, we have returned over $15.6 billion to shareholders and remain on track to exceed our $16 billion return of capital target by fiscal year end while also maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade rating. In Q4, we expect to continue to be active in our shares. Looking forward to Q4 and our fiscal year end, we continue to navigate the challenging macro and demand environment, including inflation, logistics constraints and pricing dynamics. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our Q4 and overall financial outlook. Given the changing demand environment driven by the headwinds I've described, we are modeling several scenarios based on a range of assumptions. For FY '22, we now see a wider range of outcomes. And as a result, we are lowering our overall outlook for FY '22. We expect to rigorously manage our overall cost structure and OpEx spend while continuing to prioritize investments where we see opportunities for growth. We expect currency to be approximately 3 percentage points, year-over-year headwind in Q4 and about 1.5 percentage points for FY '22, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. For Personal Systems, we expect many of the trends we saw in Q3 to continue, including softer demand in both consumer and commercial. We anticipate these factors will put some sequential pressure on overall pricing. We expect Personal Systems unit mix to continue to shift towards higher-value categories, including commercial premium and peripherals. With regard to our Personal Systems supply chain, we expect availability and most of our key components to improve with pockets of semiconductors to remain constrained into FY '23. We expect Personal Systems margins to be in the lower end of our 5% to 7% target range in Q4. And regarding Q4 Personal Systems revenue, we expect to be up slightly sequentially. Regarding Poly and our results, they will only reflect the last two months of the quarter, and we expect Poly to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS in FY '23. In Print, we expect further softening in demand in consumer similar to what we saw in the latter part of Q3, favorable pricing in higher-end consumer and commercial units and further normalization and mix as we expect commercial to gradually improve over time. With regard to Print supply chain, we expect, similar to Q3, component shortages and logistics delays to constrain hardware revenue in some areas. We expect these conditions to continue into FY '23, but with some incremental improvement in Q4. We now expect Print margins for Q4 specifically to once again be above the high end of our range, given continued hardware constraints and disciplined cost management. And finally, regarding supplies revenue, we are holding to our long-term outlook of a low- to mid-single-digit annual decline in constant currency. In the near term, over the next few quarters, we expect to see a decline of roughly low double digits, given the challenging environment. And as a result, we expect to be above our long-term range for FY '22. With regard to the impact of Poly on our financials in the fourth quarter and for FY '22, we expect a non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and approximately $0.05 headwind from Poly, including debt-related expenses and other deal-related costs. And for our GAAP diluted net earnings per share, we expect an incremental approximately $0.27 GAAP-only charge related to the Poly acquisition charges. And regarding free cash flow, we expected approximately $300 million cash flow headwind related to Poly acquisition and integration costs. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share for HP without Poly to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.94. For HP with Poly, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.79 to $0.89. Fourth quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share for HP without Poly to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.86. For HP with Poly, we expect fourth quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.54. We expect FY '22 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share for HP without Poly to be in the range of $4.07 to $4.17. For HP with Poly, we expect FY '22 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.02 to $4.12. And FY '22 GAAP diluted net earnings per share for HP without Poly to be in the range of $3.78 to $3.88. For HP with Poly, we expect FY '22 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.46 to $3.56. For FY '22, we now expect free cash flow for HP without Poly to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. For HP with Poly, we now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.7 billion. We continue to make progress against our priorities as we navigate through a very volatile fiscal 2022. And we are taking decisive actions with the levers within our control. Looking forward, we plan to provide guidance for FY '23 as part of our Q4 earnings call. Typically, we would provide guidance as part of our Annual Analyst Day or Security Analyst Meeting event. Moving forward, we plan to have these Analyst Day events biannually or as we have key updates to our strategy. We continue to be confident in our ability to deliver long-term value creation and we look forward to sharing our progress with you. I'll stop here so we can take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will be from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Erik Woodring : I guess maybe one for you, Enrique, and then one for you, Marie. Just on the pricing side, Enrique, maybe can you just give us a little more detail on the pricing actions you're taking and really in respect to kind of balancing or the challenge of balancing kind of softening demand with U.S. dollar strength and what that means for international sales. And if you could just specify again across Personal Systems and Print, that would be super. And then I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Sure. Thank you, Erik. So I think that overall this quarter and similar to what we have done in the previous quarter, the team has done a very nice job managing pricing. If we look at year-on-year compares, we continue to see benefit of pricing, which is really driven by this. What we're starting to see is some erosion quarter-on-quarter, driven by both the increase in competitiveness that we see but also by the fact that, especially in PC, we see a high channel inventory. So, we expect that the pricing situation is going to become more aggressive, especially as we enter in Q4. From a currency perspective, traditionally, we have been very effective managing currency and pricing it. Again, depends also on what the competitive situation is and what the channel inventory is. So we may not be able to fully price it, but traditionally, this has been one of the key things that we have done over time. Erik Woodring : Super. And then maybe, Marie, just a quick clarification question regarding Poly. Is the low single-digit sequential increase in fiscal 4Q revenue that you're talking about, is that overall revenue? And does that include the two months of Poly? And do we think about including that in Personal Systems for now? Are you thinking about re-segmenting? Just any color that you could provide there would be super helpful. Marie Myers : Sure, Erik. So maybe I'll just start out by clarifying Poly. So for now, Poly will be in our Personal Systems external reporting going forward. And in terms of Poly, just a point of clarification, the guide actually just comprehends the last two months of Poly. So going forward, we do expect Poly to be accretive to our non-GAAP EPS. And in terms of the $0.05 headwind, there's a combination of both macro headwinds in there and plus debt-related expenses and integration costs. But net-net, Erik, it's roughly in line with our expectations. And just a point to follow up on Enrique's comments on currency, we do actually see a 3-point headwind in Q4 as well. Enrique Lores : Let me share kind of the excitement that we have about the announcement we made yesterday. We think that the acquisition of Poly positions us very strongly as a leader in hybrid work. We see tremendous opportunity to add value, to innovate and to differentiate ourselves. So, we're really eager to start working with the Poly/HP team to start bringing new solutions to market and really expand that business. Operator : Your next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open. Toni Sacconaghi : I'm wondering if you can just comment on the state of your backlog in the Personal Systems group. I think going into the quarter, you had anticipated not being able to reduce backlog because it was elevated. And I'm wondering whether backlog changed over the course of the quarter and whether you expect backlog to be at normal levels by changed over the course of I have a follow-up, please. Enrique Lores : Thank you, Toni. I'll take that one. So backlog reduced during the quarter. As we had talked before, majority of the backlog was on the commercial side. And given the supply chain improvements that we had that we were expecting, we were able to clear some of it. We are entering Q4 still with more elevated backlog than normal, but it's lower than what we had at the beginning of the quarter. Toni Sacconaghi : And do you expect to be at normal levels at the end of the fourth quarter? And maybe I'll ask my second question with -- at this point as well. Supplies was down 9%. That feels extremely abrupt, change from kind of the minus 3% level that you were at before. Was there any meaningful level of supplies channel inventory change? And I think you said you anticipated supplies being down double digits for the next few quarters. How do we know that there's not something structural akin to what we saw a couple of years ago happening with supplies? And why shouldn't we be worried about a pronounced negative mix shift, given supplies are higher margin than hardware, that once hardware goes back to kind of normalized pricing levels, printing margins could actually be below your trend? Enrique Lores : Sure. So let me answer first the question on backlog. Our current plan is that we should be able to clear that during Q4, of course, depends on both how demand and supply able, but this is a plan that we have at this stage. And really, thinking about the question on supply because I -- this is really something that I wanted to clarify. The situation that we see today is radically different from what we saw in 2019. The slowdown that we have seen is driven by a reduction in demand especially in consumer, which is driven by the macroeconomic situation, very similar to what we are seeing in consumer PCs. If I look at the business fundamentals like share, they are behaving as expected. And even if channel inventory is slightly high, again driven by the slowdown we have seen in demand, overall channel inventory dollars are down year-on-year. So therefore, we see this as temporary. It's similar to other economic slowdowns that we have seen in the past and the speed of decline has been similar. But long term, we continue to project that supplies will decline in low to mid-single digits. And based on how we have designed the strategy of the Company, we don't need supplies to grow to meet our profit goals. And maybe one silver lining that I would like to share is something that we have seen through this quarter and that has confirmed the importance of the strategy is that subscription models are significantly more resilient than the traditional model, which really reinforces the need to continue to shift the business towards that model. Operator : Your next question comes from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Shannon Cross : I was wondering sort of a follow-up to that. Can you talk a bit about the subscription business in maybe more detail? I'm just wondering percent of revenue or growth you've seen. Also, anything you can talk about with Print+ in terms of regaining share from the aftermarket? And then I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Sure. And Shannon, it's great to hear your voice again. So talking about Instant Ink, it continues to grow double digit, both revenue and net new subscribers so all this is doing really well. And really, this is driven by the fact that the value proposition to consumers is better than the traditional model. Cost of printing is lower. It is more convenient because they get consumables at home. And on top of that, it's more sustainable, which is really becoming, every time, more important. We continue to see growth in that space, and you are going to continue to shift the business in that direction. And as we have discussed in the past, we continue to see this as a platform to sell additional subscription programs. And as we shared a few months ago, we have example, the pilot of paper subscription in the U.S., and we are seeing good traction and good progress. So very, very good progress there. In terms of HP+, penetration continues to grow. We announced a new system on the laser side this quarter that had very strong reception. And as we have shared in the script, when we look at the combination of HP+ plus Big Ink and Big Toner, the combination of both is more than 50%, 5-0, of our hardware shipment this quarter. So this talks about the progress that we continue to make in that space; and this is really important, as we have said before, to rebalance profitability between hardware and supplies. Shannon Cross : Okay. And then you're basically about 16% -- I'm sorry, I'm echoing, one second. You're basically at about $16 billion for your cash return to shareholders. I'm curious as to how you're thinking about it, given the potential pressure on free cash flow, given the PC business slowdown. What we should think about in terms of your commitment to share repurchase and I mean, obviously, dividend growth over the coming year or two? Enrique Lores : Sure. So for the rest of the year, we have shared that we are going to be exceeding the plan that we explained about three years ago to returning $16 billion of capital, so we will be above that plan. In terms of going forward, we don't foresee any changes in our capital allocation strategy. We are going to continue to execute the model that we have been sharing or the framework that we have been sharing during the last year. First of all, we think that for us, it's important to stay investment-grade credit rating. For us to be there, we need to be in a leverage ratio between 1.5 and 2, which is where we are now. And once we are in that range, our plan is to continue to return 100% of free cash flow to investors, either in dividend or in share buyback unless an M&A opportunity with a better return shows up. This is what we have been doing during the last quarter, and this continues to be the plan going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sidney Ho : Last quarter, you had expected strength in the commercial PC for the rest of fiscal '22. Obviously, things have changed. It seems like third quarter commercial revenue did decline but better than consumer. When did you start seeing signs of demand weakness? Any color on how the quarter progress would be great? And do you have a view when you will start seeing some stabilization in that market? Then I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Sure, thank you. So let me explain what we have seen on the commercial side, which is a little bit more complex than on the consumer side. But I think the influencing factors are the same. I mean, really how the macro situation has evolved and the implications of -- especially of inflation and the -- and companies in general becoming more cautious as they manage that investment. So what we are seeing is that from one side, companies continue to open significant deals because they see the need to improve the experience of their employees as they come to the office. Feedback that we get constantly from our customers is that the employees have now better systems to work from home than to work in the office, so they need to invest in the equipment in the office to convince them to come back to the office. And this is really creating a lot of opportunities and the funnel of opportunities that we see is very significant, significantly above what we need to make our sales targets. But at the same time, what we are seeing is once we win those deals, the conversion of those deals into orders has slowed down, which really reflects the fact that enterprises are being more cautious in how they manage their budgets for any new employees that are hired. And this is having an impact. This had an impact in Q3 of orders in the commercial space. Additionally to this, we also saw, at the end of the quarter, a reduction in sell-out, especially in the more transactional commercial categories, those that are closer to the consumer business. And this is what we are projecting is going to continue into Q4. And this was one of the elements that Marie commented that we are using in our guide because we have seen the slowdown in the commercial category. Sidney Ho : Okay, that's helpful. My follow-up question is I want to get an update on your growth area initiatives. You kind of talked about the various businesses there. But you already had $5.6 billion of revenue in the first half of fiscal '22, so reaching $10 billion target doesn't seem to be a stretch. But can you talk about what you expect half over half in the second half of the fiscal year? Especially interested in your comments on gaming, given what we've been hearing about the weakness there, but also how does the full year target change with the inclusion of Poly? Enrique Lores : Okay. So let me start from the end. When we talk about being above $10 billion, we are not including the additional revenue coming from Poly. We were not planning to close the deal in Q4 and the target was without them. So what we have seen for the category is continue of the overall categories' double-digit growth. And I -- let me refresh what these categories are because the consumer subscriptions, is workforce solutions. It is gaming. It is industrial print. It is industrial print and 3D and is peripheral. So all these categories overall are growing double digit. Of course, some of them are growing slower than others. In this quarter, we saw slower performance of gaming than what we had seen in the past, which was a combination of demand and some supply constraints that we were expecting, but we expect it to recover in Q4. So overall, very strong performance of the growth businesses that is really critical for us because this is -- they will continue to contribute to the overall growth of the Company even in a more relevant way going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open. Wamsi Mohan : Enrique, I was wondering if you might be willing to share some thoughts on the PC industry outlook overall for calendar '22? I think industry analysts are forecasting roughly 300 million. We heard one of your large competitors talk about a number that's lower. Our own work is showing something even lower than that. And any early thoughts into calendar '23, particularly as we stand here because there's a lot of concern about things reverting to sort of pre-COVID levels, given the dynamics that happened during COVID. And I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Sure. So, our current projection is similar to what you were describing. We see the market somewhere in between 290 million to 300 million units. This is what we are using for our plan. This is in June. We continue to see more growth from the premium categories. So from a revenue perspective, the market is proportionally bigger from that perspective. This is still significantly higher than what we -- than where we were pre COVID. And we think that the fundamentals of the business have not changed from the perspective that PCs are way more relevant now than they were three years ago. If you think about hybrid work, for example, which is where we think the majority of the companies are going to be working, if you think how majority of the companies are going to be working. If you think about telehealth, if you think about how students are using PCs today, all these are drivers of growth for PC. We see that the slowdown we are going through in consumer and potentially in commercial is driven by macro, is not driven by preferences for PCs or whether PCs are more useful or not. We continue to believe they are critical. And so, we remain optimistic about the future of PCs even if we think we are going to go through this temporary headwind driven by the macro situation. Wamsi Mohan : Any thoughts on '23 there? And as a follow-up, can you talk about the state of the channel in terms of inventory? You clearly noted a more aggressive pricing environment. How worried should investors be about any potential write-downs that you might have to take? And do you expect the PC print profit mix to revert back to the 75%-25% as we look over the next few years? Enrique Lores : So in terms of '23, at this stage, since we think that the major impact is macro, it's really hard to predict what is going to be the evolution on the macro side. And this is why we highlighted that we -- given that macro we cannot control, we are taking all the necessary actions in the Company to manage it through the next quarter because we think the difficult macro situation is going to continue. In terms of guide for fiscal year '23, we will be providing it at the end of -- during our Q4 call, and then this is the plan to share kind of how do we see the different businesses performing. And then in terms of channel, and these were like three follow-ups in the follow-up, we see, as I mentioned, high inventory in the channel. We are going to be managing it down through the different quarters, and we have this built into the guide that Marie shared with all of you. Marie Myers : And what just said, so just a point of clarification on the inventory. So it's certainly on the PS side of the house that in Print hardware, actually, we're in good shape, given the current supply chain position. And also, just to add a comment to Enrique's comments about the PS profit mix and how to think about the rates, et cetera, I mean, we do expect, however, for PS to stay in those long-term ranges. So if you think about the acquisition of -- we just did here of Poly, I think that's a good example of how we see these growth businesses that have higher gross margins really playing into the mix going forward as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : I guess if I can start with the PS segment. You've talked today about primarily the sort of consumer weakness that you're seeing, but you still expect the mix to sort of move towards the higher end there in terms of the high-end consumer, premium consumer remaining strong. I'm just wondering, what are you seeing in terms of price elasticity from consumers? Why shouldn't we sort of be a bit more concerned that maybe the next step is for consumers to start to trade down a bit and sort of the mixing to start to move down a bit? If you can share your thoughts around that and then I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Yes. Let me share our view on that. What we are seeing in consumer is a shift towards more premium category because we think that the traditional buyer of the premium category is less impacted by the macro situation that we see. As inflation has grown, as energy prices have increased in many parts of the world, as food prices have increased, families with lower income, families with lower budgets have a bigger impact. And they usually or traditionally buy lower price PCs versus families with higher impact. And we think this is really one of the key drivers of the change of mix that we are seeing. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. And a quick follow-up for Marie here. Marie, I'm just looking at the cash flow, updated cash flow guidance and the change in the cash flow seems a bit more pronounced than the change in the earnings outlook, particularly as if I walk through sort of the EPS changes on the share count. It just looks like the cash flow is coming down a lot more. If you can just walk me through the big sort of buckets in terms of the cash flow guidance change. Marie Myers : Yes. No, we expect our cash flow is largely in line with our net earnings. Obviously, there's some differences quarter-to-quarter on working capital. But just in terms of how to think about cash flow and the guide and what we see as some of the drivers for Q4, firstly, I'd say, look, we've got plans to improve our working capital sequentially. And we're seeing that just in terms of the lower inventory levels. You would have seen that in Q3. We expect operationally to take additional actions going into Q4. I'd say we also, in this last quarter in Q3, we did have some timing impacts around other assets and higher accounts receivable from our contract manufacturers, which caused that AR to be collected in early Q4. This was caused by component receipts and delays to us. So therefore, those month three shipments to our CMs were late. Now we do also continue to expect to see some sequential improvement in PS volumes. As you know, PS is a negative cash conversion cycle so that will be a tailwind. So based on these factors, I'm confident in our free cash flow outlook of 3.5 to 4 for HP for the year. Operator : Next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : Enrique, in your comments, you talked about sort of ASP declines becoming a bit stronger as you move through the quarter. And it also sounds like the commercial order slowing or sort of protracting is just on the front end. And so I guess the question is, should we anticipate the fundamentals become a bit more challenging post the [indiscernible] over quarter, if even just in the near term. And then I have a quick follow-up as well. Enrique Lores : So we are not guiding next year. And we expect that channel inventory will be corrected or will be partially corrected at least during Q4. But as we entered in Q4, we expect this more aggressive pricing dynamics. When we look at the channel inventory of the industry, this is not an HP particular situation, channel inventories are high. And therefore, we expect to see competition be more aggressive on pricing. This is -- we are not going to be the drivers of that. We will only respond if we see the need to manage our sell-out. But we expect to see prices more -- pricing more aggressive as we enter in Q4. Marie Myers : And another, just to add in the -- I'm just going to add that our chrome shipments fall off, so in terms of the compares, so that was a tailwind obviously for Q3, which won't be repeated in Q4. Ananda Baruah : Helpful. And then a quick follow-up is the transformation plan that you're going to be talking to us about 90 days, would we be -- I'm just trying to get a sense of how incremental it is. And I guess the way I'll ask the question is, would we be hearing of you guys -- in 90 days, would you be describing to us some actions that you'd be taking or some plan if you weren't seeing the incremental macro impact currently? Enrique Lores : Yes. I think what, in any case, no matter what the macro is, we need to continue to improve the efficiency of the Company. And the investments that we have done during the last years in IT and in digital systems will allow us to continue to do going forward. So what you will see from us is this plan that will show what are the investments that we are going to be making, what are the returns that we expect to see over time, but a big part of it is be driven by digital, leveraging from the work that has been done during the last years. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thank you. Enrique and Marie, when you mentioned about pricing and margins to kind of -- I'm sorry, margins to come down a little bit lower, I remember pre COVID, it was 3.5% to 5.5% operating margins for PS, and I think you took it from 5% to 7%. Are you kind of saying now we should kind of start to model in getting back to the 3.5% to 5.5% range? Or are you talking about kind of the lower end of the 5% to 7% range? I'm just kind of wondering about have we structurally moved higher or is it actually with more supply, going to go back to the 3.5% to 5.5% range? Marie Myers : Jim, it's Marie. So we absolutely remain committed to our long-term ranges for PS that we gave at our Security Analyst Meeting. I think the point of clarification is just what we're expecting to see in Q4, where we do expect to be at the lower end of the range based on a lot of what you've heard on the call today. Plus also remember that Q4 is typically our consumer holiday season where you'll see obviously a slightly different mix from a pricing perspective. So overall, Jim, we're not changing our ranges and we're staying on track for our long-term range. Enrique Lores : And just a reminder, Jim, what we said is we expected to see within the 5% to 7% range. We were already expecting margins for PC to go down as we shared that range. But we also were expecting the new businesses, peripherals and services, to grow in relevance to growing mix to compensate for the decline. These were the model that we had a year ago, continues to be the plan. We just need to see how this manages now as we face this new and unexpected economic headwind. Okay. So I think we are at the end of the time. Thank you all for joining us today and for spending the last hour with us. I would like to make a few comments. Clearly, during the quarter, even if we faced significant economic challenges, we delivered solid EPS growth of 4%, and we continue to return capital to shareholders, in this case, was $1.3 billion. We are taking clear actions to mitigate the near-term macro headwinds that we are facing while we continue to drive progress and execute on our long-term growth strategy. Because as we always say, this, as every other, is an opportunity to further strengthen the Company and to continue to build a stronger HP. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Enrique Lores : Thank you, Orit, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. I'm going to focus my remarks on three key topics : First, I will recap our Q4 and full year results. Then I will discuss actions we are taking to position our business for the future, including a new three-year plan focused on structural cost reductions that will drive the next phase of our digital transformation and the investment in our growth businesses. And I will close by talking about our outlook for 2023. But let me start by setting some important context. It has now been three years since I became CEO. From the day I took over, my top priority has been to deliver long-term, sustainable, profitable growth while transforming our business for the future, and we have made important progress. We started by launching an aggressive plan to unlock value. We implemented a new global operating model that brought us closer to customers and helped us significantly reduce structural costs. We initiated actions to rebalance profitability in our Print business. And we began to diversify our portfolio to capture more value per customer. We expanded into adjacent growth categories such as peripherals. We extended our services and solutions offering, and we shifted more of our business to subscription and contractual models. These changes helped us to improve our operational performance. They also position us well for the disruption caused by the pandemic, which we were able to use as a catalyst to accelerate our transformation. And our track record over these past few years provides a window into what you can expect from us moving forward. We have proven to be resilient in the face of changing market conditions. We delivered strong free cash flow, controlled our costs and scaled our growth businesses. At the same time, we will continue challenging ourselves to do better regardless of the external environment, and there are areas where we need to do better. When we see things that aren't working, we will fix them, and we will embrace every opportunity to improve our performance because our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders deserve nothing less. You can expect us to take the same approach in 2023 and beyond.  Let me now turn to our results for the quarter. Revenue was $14.8 billion, down 11% nominally or 8% in constant currency. This reflects macro headwinds in the market and is very consistent with what we described last quarter. We continue to focus on what we can control. We managed our pricing mix and cost to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.85, which is towards the high end of our previously provided outlook. And we delivered strong free cash flow of $1.8 billion, while returning $1 billion to shareholders. Very importantly, we also maintained our momentum in our growth portfolio. In short, we did what we said we were going to do last quarter.  Turning to our Q4 business unit performance. Personal Systems revenue were $10.3 billion. That's down 9% in constant currency year-over-year, but up 2% sequentially or 4% in constant currency, including two months of Poly's results. The Poly integration is going well so far with the business performing better than expected. We continue to receive very positive feedback from the market about the opportunity ahead. We are well positioned to accelerate our peripheral growth, and we expect Poly to be accretive to non-GAAP operating profit and EPS in fiscal year '23. Our PS operating margin was 4.5% in the quarter, below our long-term target range due to increased competitive pricing, particularly in EMEA. Still, we remain confident in the long-term trajectory of PS as we navigate near-term volatility in the market. The PS TAM remains above pre-pandemic levels, and we are making progress against our long-term strategic priorities. This includes shifting more of our mix to high-value segments. In Q4, our Commercial business continues to account for more than 2/3 of our overall PS revenue. However, we are not satisfied with our PS market share results this quarter. We know we can do better, and we will. We see many opportunities to improve our execution and gain share in key segments of the market.  In Print, revenue was $4.5 billion. That's down 7% year-over-year or 6% in constant currency, largely due to continued softness in the Consumer market, both hardware and supplies and supply constraints. That said, our operating margin of 19.9% was well above our target range, reflecting disciplined cost management and pricing. Our Commercial business made a good recovery during the quarter, with office hardware revenue growing double digits year-over-year and sequentially. This was offset by declines in home and supplies, both of which were in line with our expectations. We also made progress against our plan to rebalance system profitability and further reduce our reliance on transactional supplies. HP+ and Big Tank printers continue to become a larger portion of our portfolio mix, representing about 55% of our printer shipments. And we had another good quarter in Industrial Graphics and 3D, both of which grew revenue year-over-year and sequentially. Now turning to the full year. Our Q4 results capped off a solid 2022 in the face of tough market conditions in the second half. Fiscal year '22 revenue was $63 billion. That's down 1% nominally and up 1% in constant currency. We exceeded our full year revenue target for our key growth businesses, each of which delivered double-digit organic growth. Collectively, they generated more than $11 billion in revenue. That's $1 billion above our target and reflects the strong momentum we are building. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $4.08. That's up 8% year-over-year and within our target range. We generated free cash flow of $3.9 billion, and we returned $5.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We also continued to advance our sustainable impact agenda. This is a key differentiator for our brand, and I am proud of the work our teams are doing to make it a competitive advantage. This year, we were the only technology company globally to receive an A rating from CDP, one of the world's leading NGOs dedicated to environmental sustainability reporting. And almost all the new printers, laptops, notebooks, displays and workstations we launched in 2022 included recycled materials. Sustainable impact will remain a key strategic priority moving forward. Fiscal year '22 also marked the completion of our three-year value creation plan, and we exceeded all the key targets we set. In addition to delivering on our financial commitments, the plan drove important investments in our future. Most notably, we invested in our digital infrastructure to begin replatform in the company. And we invested in both R&D and M&A to accelerate the growth of our businesses. These investments have strengthened our resilience and positioned as well for the volatile market ahead. I now want to talk about what comes next because while we have delivered on our value plan, we are not done, and we have initiated the next phase of our transformation. Our ultimate goal is to create a Future Ready HP. Future Ready is our strategic framework that we are driving across the company. It has two primary objectives. One is to develop the portfolio and operational capabilities needed to drive sustainable growth. The other is to further reduce our cost. Marie will talk more about the cost side of this transformation. Today, I am going to walk you through three key elements of our Future Ready plan, digital transformation, portfolio optimization and operational efficiency. They are also the major drivers of savings of the plan we are announcing today. I will start with digital transformation. We are continuing the process of digitizing the company. We plan to capitalize on the infrastructure investments we made over the past three years to simplify and accelerate many processes through automation and end-to-end management. For example, we are launching end-to-end initiatives that will enable faster conversion from lead generation to free cash flow. Our digital transformation will also drive productivity, speed and quality of our execution across supply chain, customer support and go-to-market. In addition, our new digital backbone will enable us to scale key growth businesses by delivering new customer value propositions such as personalized services and solutions that allow us to capture more value per customer.  The second area of focus is on optimizing our portfolio. In the current environment, I believe it's essential that we zero-in on businesses where we can drive significant competitive advantage and market leadership. We have an opportunity to create a more focused and more growth-oriented line of businesses based on innovation that meets the changing needs of our customers. We also have opportunities to simplify our portfolio. For example, in Personal Systems, there is an opportunity to significantly reduce our number of unique SKUs. And we plan to significantly reduce complexity and cost in businesses where we don't expect to achieve growth but can drive value. A significant portion of the savings we generate is expected to be invested to drive innovation in our key growth businesses to increase the lifetime value of our customers. I'll give you some examples. In hybrid work solutions, we intend to leverage the combined strength of Poly and HP to drive attach, while expanding in software and services to deliver differentiated hybrid work solutions for meeting rooms and home offices. In gaming, we see significant opportunity to drive better collective experiences through both software and hardware. And we will create seamless experiences across PCs, displays and peripherals. Through our newly informed workforce services and solutions business, we will simplify IT management for customers through new Device-As-A-Service offering tailored for hybrid ecosystem. We will also expand our consumer services offerings beyond Instant Ink to include new areas such as paper and print hardware. In Industrial Graphics, we will continue to lead the industry in innovation that drives that analog-to-digital transformation. And in 3D, we will continue to invest in our own 3D end-to-end printing applications and in our metals portfolio. And we expect these businesses collectively to continue growing organically double digits next year. The third area of focus I'm going to cover today is delivering operational excellence. We plan to continue to optimize our performance by driving efficiencies, simplifying organizational structure and removing unnecessary costs. This work will build on our previous transformation initiatives to unlock new structural savings. We will be taking actions across the company to reduce our variable spend and structural costs. For example, in our Print business, we will further reduce our core fixed cost structure and align it to post-pandemic market sizing. And our consumer subscription offerings will allow us to be more efficient in simplifying our portfolio. The cost actions of our Future Ready plan will generate at least $1.4 billion in gross annual run rate structural savings by year-end fiscal year '25. They will allow us to mitigate near-term market headwinds, mitigate softness in the core businesses; and just as importantly, to maintain investments in long-term growth. As part of the actions we are taking, we will be reducing the size of our workforce over the next three years. We expect to reduce it by 4,000 to 6,000 people. These are the toughest decisions we have to make because they impact colleagues we care deeply about. We are committed to treating people with care and respect, including financial and career services support to help them find their next opportunity. But while these are difficult decisions, we are doing what's best for our business.  Let me now provide some color on our outlook for the year ahead. We expect to operate in a challenging macro environment during fiscal year '23. In our guide, we are not assuming a significant economic recovery over the next 12 months. We expect our second half performance to improve, mostly driven by the cost-saving measures we are implementing. We plan to maintain our current capital allocation approach, applying the same framework we have used during the last three years. We plan to continue to return at least 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders over time unless opportunities with a better return on investment arise and as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x. Given the volatility of the market, we believe it's important to maintain a healthy balance sheet through prudent financial management. Therefore, we will temporarily reduce our share repurchase activity in the near term. We are confident in the actions we are taking to navigate current market conditions and drive long-term value creation. And today marks the start of the next phase of our strategic journey. While our growth trajectory may be uneven in the face of volatile market conditions, we remain confident to grow low single digits over the long term. Based on our track record over these past three years, you can count on us to deliver on our commitments. Let me now hand the call over to Marie to talk more about our financials and outlook. Marie Myers : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Our Q4 results were impacted by many of the same macroeconomic challenges we highlighted last quarter, including a significant slowdown in consumer demand, FX and inflation. That said, we are adapted quickly to the current environment and have demonstrated disciplined cost management to deliver solid results to finish out the year. In addition, we returned significant capital to our shareholders while successfully closing our acquisition of Poly. We continue to believe in the long-term opportunities across our business and are confident we have the right strategy and portfolio of assets to drive long-term value creation. Today, I will cover our Q4 results and a recap of FY '22 followed by details about the cost transformation component of Future Ready, building upon the foundation we laid in our previous program and then finish with our outlook for Q1 and FY '23.  Turning to our Q4 results. Net revenue was $14.8 billion in the quarter, down 11% nominally and 8% in constant currency. Gross margin was 18.4% in the quarter, down 1.2 points year-on-year driven by FX and increased pricing competition, particularly in PS. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.6 billion or 10.7% of revenue, down 18% year-on-year.  In Q4, we installed further rigor at our cost management with OpEx down sequentially, excluding Poly. Year-on-year, we reduced our OpEx spend by nearly $350 million by prioritizing our spend and reducing variable compensation, while also capturing additional structural cost savings under our transformation plan. At the same time, we made and expect to continue to make prudent and targeted investments where we anticipate significant opportunity to drive growth, including our key growth areas, which Enrique outlined earlier. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, down 15%. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $128 million for the quarter, up sequentially, largely as a result of our acquisition of Poly. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share decreased 10% to $0.85 with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes net expenses totaling $855 million, primarily related to acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangibles, tax adjustments and restructuring and other charges, partially offset by non-operating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q4 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was zero, mostly due to onetime noncash tax expenses.  Now let's turn to segment performance. In Q4, Personal Systems revenue was $10.3 billion, down 13% or 9% in constant currency. This compares to the 3-point headwind we had expected. PS revenue includes just two months of Poly's results following the successful completion of the acquisition in late August. Total units were down 21% on tough compares. We also saw pricing competition increase sequentially due to high-channel inventory across the industry. And while supply availability has improved significantly, constraints persisted in some pockets of the business.  Drilling into the details, Commercial revenue was down 6% or 2% in constant currency. Consumer revenue was down 25% or 21% in constant currency, with FX remaining a significant headwind this quarter. As an example, currency was an approximate 6-point headwind to our Personal Systems business in EMEA this quarter, increasing 1 percentage point sequentially. By product category, revenue was down 23% for notebooks, up 1% for desktops and up 9% for workstations. We saw a strong recovery in gaming sequentially with revenue up solid double digits due to better product availability.  We have cleared most of our outstanding backlog and finished the quarter at a level consistent with pre-pandemic levels and with most of the remaining backlog reflecting higher value units. Personal Systems delivered $458 million of operating profit with operating margins of 4.5%. We ended the quarter below our long-term range for operating margins, largely as a result of particular weakness in EMEA Consumer revenue. Operating margin declined 2 points year-over-year due to currency and increased promotional activity given elevated industry channel inventory levels, especially in the Consumer business. These headwinds were partially offset by mix, lower commodity costs and variable compensation. We are pleased with the strong execution by the Poly team. They delivered just above breakeven operating profit and exceeded expectations for the quarter. In Print, our results reflect our focus on execution and the breadth of our portfolio as we navigated the highly dynamic environment. In Q4, total Print revenue was $4.5 billion, down 7% nominally or 6% in constant currency, driven by lower Supplies revenue and lower home hardware units combined with increased pricing competition in the home business. This was partially offset by higher office hardware units and ASPs and growth in Industrial Graphics and Instant Ink services. Total hardware units declined 3% driven largely by continued supply constraints for certain IC components and lower Consumer demand. We have taken mitigating actions that are beginning to yield improvements in our supply availability at a pace consistent with our plans. While this has enabled us to make progress on reducing our backlog, we still expect print hardware constraints to extend into FY '23.  By customer segment, Commercial revenue increased 1% or 5% in constant currency, with units up 5%. Consumer revenue was down 7% or 4% in constant currency with units down 4%. Office continued with its gradual recovery, while pricing remained disciplined even as supply constraints eased incrementally. Home hardware demand softened further sequentially, particularly in the EMEA and Americas regions impacting ASPs as competitive pricing increased during the quarter. In Q4, Commercial recovery remained slow due to the gradual and uneven pace at which the return to office is progressing. There were pockets of strength with commercial hardware units up 5%. And in graphics, our Indigo business closed its largest deal to date for 50 digital presses with ePAC, a leader in the flexible packaging market. Supplies revenue of $2.7 billion declined just under 10% in constant currency, slightly better than expected as demand weakness appeared to stabilize in the quarter. The decline was driven primarily by continued Consumer weakness, particularly in the EMEA region and the slow recovery in the office, partially offset by favorable pricing actions and continued market share gains in ink and toner. Supplies finished FY '22 down nearly 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for approximate 1-point headwind related to the exit of our Russia business, the year-on-year decline in Supplies came in consistent with our original guidance range of a decline of low to mid-single digits. Print operating profit increased $73 million to $903 million, up 9%, yielding an exceptional operating margin of 19.9%. Operating margin increased 2.9 points year-on-year, driven by favorable overall pricing and OpEx management, including lower variable compensation, partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher commodity costs. Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation in Q4. Q4 cash flow from operations and free cash flow was $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, exceeding our guidance for the quarter. The cash conversion cycle was minus 29 days in the quarter, flat sequentially as lower days payable outstanding and higher days sales outstanding was offset by the decrease in days of inventory. In Q4, we returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders. This included $750 million in share repurchases and $249 million in cash dividends. At the end of FY '22, we successfully finished our transformation plan, generating better-than-expected structural cost savings. Our strong performance and our value plan over the past three years, including our capital return and broader capital allocation priorities were made possible in part by the transformation journey we have been on. In 2019, we launched a three-year plan to unlock significant value and become a leaner, simpler and more digitally enabled company. We took decisive actions aligned to the principles of our value creation plan to become closer to our customers by simplifying our operations and replatforming the company. In total, our transformation program delivered growth annualized run rate savings of over $1.3 billion and reduced our headcount by approximately 7,700 as expected. As part of our simplification journey, we changed our operating model, moving to one commercial organization, and created strong centers of excellence to drive efficiency and faster decision-making. In addition, we optimized our real estate footprint, creating efficient digital workspaces as we transitioned to a hybrid work model. We also made significant progress in optimizing our manufacturing footprint and continuing to enhance resiliency while reducing our cost structure. Digital replatforming was another defining enabler of our transformation efforts. We built a new digital backbone for the company with the deployment of one ERP system, creating the ability to deploy additional tools and capabilities. In addition, this new platform provides the foundation upon which we can drive incremental cost savings as well as build new businesses with different business models as we move into FY '23 with the launch of our Future Ready Transformation Plan. We are now launching cost action efforts as part of that Future Ready program, continuing to the next phase of our transformation. We'll continue to take actions to reduce structural costs across COGS and OpEx to drive efficiencies while protecting the investments necessary to accelerate our transformation, ensuring we are well positioned to drive long-term growth. This program is expected to run for three years, and we expect to generate at least $1.4 billion in gross annual run rate structural cost savings by the end of FY '25. We expect at least 40% of the run rate savings or approximately $560 million to be achieved by the end of FY '23. We have line of sight to these savings, and we also have a good funnel of additional cost savings opportunities that we are betting to help us exceed these targets. The total expected restructuring charge is approximately $1 billion, which includes approximately $200 million in noncash charges in FY '23. We anticipate approximately $600 million of the total charges to be in FY '23 with the rest split roughly equally in FY '24 and FY '25. As Enrique mentioned, we take workforce reductions very seriously and with the utmost care, but they remain critical to the long-term health of HP. In total, we expect to reduce headcount by 4,000 to 6,000 over the next three years. In addition to labor-related restructuring charges of roughly $700 million, we expect additional non-labor charges related to IT, real estate and other corporate charges. We anticipate the gross savings from this next phase of transformation will partially offset the challenging macro in the near term and incremental investments in growth opportunities we discussed earlier. In summary, these actions will help enable us to build a stronger HP. Looking forward to our Q1 and FY '23 outlook. We continue to believe in the long-term opportunities and growth in our end markets, including our key growth areas and our strategy to create value for shareholders over time. Given the current macro environment, we do expect near-term volatility, in particular, keep the following in mind related to Q1 and FY '23 financial outlook. Given the challenging macro environment driven by the headwinds I've described, we are modeling multiple scenarios based on several assumptions. For FY '23, we see a wide range of potential outcomes, which are reflected in the outlook ranges we are providing today. Consistent with our Q4 results and ongoing strategy, we will continue to rigorously manage our OpEx spend while continuing to prioritize investments where we see opportunities for growth. This is made possible in part by the decisive cost actions we are announcing today. We expect currency to be about an approximate 5% year-over-year headwind in Q1 and 5% for FY '23 reflecting the current strength of the U.S. dollar. In Personal Systems, we expect the overall PC market to see an approximate 10-point unit decline versus FY '22. Many of the recent challenges we have seen in FY '22 will likely continue into FY '23, including softer demand in both Consumer and Commercial and higher channel inventory levels across the industry. We anticipate these factors will put continued pressure on overall pricing at least through the first half of '23. We expect Personal Systems unit mix to continue to improve as we focus on higher-value categories, including commercial premium and hybrid work solutions. We expect Personal Systems margins to be below the low end of our 5% to 7% target range through at least the first half of FY '23 driven by the high normalization of industry channel inventory levels and then improve into the second half as channel inventory normalizes and our transformation-related cost actions start to more meaningfully impact our cost structure. And regarding Q1 Personal Systems revenue, we expect to be down mid-single digits sequentially. In Print, in terms of the overall print market sizing, we expect it to be down approximately 3% year-on-year driven by the challenging macro environment and slower-than-expected return to the office. In the office market, we continue to expect the market sizing to be approximately 80% of our pre-pandemic projections. In home, we expect the market to be down in '23 versus the exceptional performance during COVID, but still above our pre-pandemic projections. We expect continued softness in Consumer demand and favorable pricing in Commercial units, offsetting some normalization in Consumer pricing, particularly in the first half of '23.  In terms of our print hardware supply chain, we expect constraints to continue, particularly in office hardware, at least through first half of FY '23. We expect Print margins for FY '23 to be at the high end of our 16% to 18% range, driven by the resiliency of our portfolio and disciplined pricing and cost management including our transformation efforts to reduce our print fixed cost structure, as Enrique mentioned. And finally, regarding Supplies revenue, we expect to decline low to mid-single digits in FY '23 in constant currency, consistent with our long-term outlook. For FY '23, we expect to be within that range in aggregate. But for the first half of '23, we expect to be at similar levels to Q4 given the macro environment and tough compares. We expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion, which includes approximately $400 million of restructuring cash charges. From a seasonality perspective, we expect the second half to be stronger than the first, largely consistent with our net earnings combined with the fact that our first quarter is typically lower given the timing of prior year variable comp. Furthermore, normal, quarterly sequential seasonality does not apply for FY '23, given the dynamic macro environment. But we do expect some improvement in our revenue trajectory in the second half of '23. That said, we expect our key growth businesses collectively will continue to grow double digits organically in FY '23 as we continue to invest in innovation and adjacent market opportunities. With regard to OpEx, we expect to rigorously manage our overall cost structure as part of our transformation, particularly in our core businesses, where we expect OpEx to be down year-on-year. However, including Poly, we do expect total OpEx to be up year-on-year. In addition, for FY '23, we expect OI&E expense will be approximately $0.5 billion, consistent with our Q4 exit run rate. Moving to capital allocation. We are not making any changes to our capital return framework. As we have discussed in the past, we are committed to our strategy of returning 100% of free cash flow to shareholders over time as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x, and there aren't any better return opportunities in order to maintain our credit rating. Given the challenging current environment, consistent with our disciplined financial management, we expect share repurchases will be modest near term based on our FY '23 outlook today.  Lastly, we announced today that we are raising our annual dividend by 5% to $1.05 per share, reflecting confidence in our long-term outlook for the business. We have raised our dividend every year since separation in late 2015. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook : We expect first quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.80 and first quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.47 to $0.57. We expect full year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.60. And FY '23 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.22 to $2.62. For FY '23, we expect our free cash flow to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion, which is net of about $400 million in restructuring cash outflows. Before we open for Q&A, I want to leave you with the following thoughts : First, as part of our Future Ready plan, we are taking clear and decisive actions, which includes aggressive structural cost reductions as we have just shared.  Second, we are adapting to these challenging market conditions with our Future Ready cost transformation program, which includes plans to drive significant cost savings. Third, we're confident in the long-term growth opportunities and are capitalizing on these opportunities by investing to become a more digital company with a more growth-oriented portfolio. Fourth, we have an experienced management team with a proven track record in up and down markets. We deliver on our financial commitments. We are disciplined in our capital allocation and committed to a strong balance sheet. In short, we are steadfast in our commitment to deliver long-term value creation. We are building a stronger HP, and I look forward to sharing our progress with you at FY '23. Operator, please open the line so we can take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I guess, Enrique, I'm hoping you just start off talking a little bit more about the transformation plan. And then what I'd love to understand is what do you think HP looks like after the transformation plan is done, maybe in terms of the growth rates on the operating margin profile versus what you've seen historically? I want to just to understand what would be different about HP post the current transformation plan? And then if you can also just touch on, how do we think about net savings, the gross numbers you're talking about through this transformation? That would be helpful. Enrique Lores : Sure. Thank you, Amit. So first of all, we -- because of the transformation, we think that we will continue to support the guide that we provided last year about sustained revenue and profit growth year-over-year. This has been the goal that we had before and continues to be the goal that we have now. From a business perspective, this will allow us to continue to accelerate our subscription and services business. We will be a more efficient company because we will be leveraging our digital infrastructure to support and to -- we will have transformed many of the key processes that we have and the mix of our business between the core businesses and what we call the growth businesses will also be different. This will be the key driver that we will expect to achieve through the transformation. Marie Myers : Amit, maybe I will just add a comment, and good afternoon, regarding the savings. So we do expect at least $1.4 billion of gross run rate structural savings by the end of '25 and approximately $560 million of that by the exit of '23. Just to add, it will be a mix of both COGS and OpEx. And we look at this over time, as Enrique said, and we expect that these savings and investments that we're making are going to provide that significant flow-through over time. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And if I can just follow up on the Print margins. They've held up really well despite the decline we see on the supply side of the business. As you think about the performance especially in the last three, four quarters on Print margins, what are the two, three things that you think made margins to sit at 20% right now, near 20%? And then what do you think is the durability of this margin level at least in the first half of next year? Marie Myers : Yes. No, thanks very much, Amit. So look, as you said, we're really pleased with the Print margins that were at 19.9% in Q4, which is actually at the high end of our expected range. And that increase, if we look at it from a year-on-year perspective, is a combination of things. Firstly, we've demonstrated disciplined OpEx management that's contributed along with overall pricing durability, as you mentioned. And I think both of these factors combined have really helped to sort of play into our performance. As we look into next year, we do expect once again to be at the high end of the range. And it's really contributed by both the resiliency of the portfolio, our strategy, a combination of that pricing management. I think that we've really mastered along, obviously, with the benefits of the Future Ready Transformation program that we just announced today as well. Enrique Lores : Yes. If you remember, we announced a plan to rebalance profitability between hardware and supplies [three] (ph) years ago. We have been executing on that. This quarter, we shared that more than 50% of the printers were profit upfront. So all this has also helped. But as Marie said, we expect to build a business within range during 2023. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Shannon Cross : My first question is looking at your growth areas. I think we understand where there's pressure on your model. But maybe if you could talk a bit more about the $11 billion in revenue that you've generated, and I'm not sure if that's like pro forma for Poly or it doesn't include Poly. I think it is excluding. I'm sure it's very small print. But if we can think about each one and their potential growth contributions, and maybe how to think about the margin potential for each one of those? And then I have a follow-up question. Enrique Lores : Sure. So yes, you are right, Shannon. The $11 billion does not include Poly so this will be on top of $11 billion that we explained. And the goal that we had at the beginning of the year was for them to be about $10 billion. So this is almost $1 billion more than what the plan was. I think what we can say at this point is all of them grew double digit during 2022, and we expect collectively to grow again double digit in 2023. And as we share, if we look at the year, the gross margin was above the gross margin of the company. In some of them, we are still in investment mode, and we know we need to continue to invest to continue to accelerate the growth. And this is one of the reasons why we have been working on the transformation for a few months now because we know that we need to both compensate for some of the challenges that we see on the market side given the slowdown in some of the markets, but we also need to continue to invest on the growth initiatives because they will carry the growth of the company and the value of the company in the future. Shannon Cross : Okay. And then Marie, if you can talk a bit about on the cash flow side of things. I mean, you're guiding $3 billion, $3.5 billion. I assume that includes restructuring. Maybe it doesn't. But just in general, how do we think about sort of normalized cash flow for this model after you go through or as you go through the restructuring plan and areas where maybe you can draw down in terms of working capital? And just again, I think people are trying to understand maybe when you would get back to where you can buy back stock, just your comfort level and what you're seeing in terms of cash flow? Marie Myers : Absolutely. And good afternoon, Shannon. So as you said, the cash flow guide is $3 billion to $3.5 billion. And just a clarification, that actually does include the $400 million of restructuring cash flow. So just take that into account in your model.  Now in terms of how to think about free cash flow, as you know, it tracks with net earnings. But in any quarter, as you've seen just in our results, in the last couple of quarters, it's driven very much by the mix of business that we see in the quarter and changes in working capital. And those items include everything from the restructuring, the bonus, et cetera, and also just adjustments that we make to our inventory level. So you're going to expect that there's going to be a level of seasonality around it as well. And then as we're thinking -- specifically about the first quarter that's coming up, we would say it's going to be -- we're going to guide here to a lower number because we expect typically from a seasonality perspective, that's when we pay out the bonus that we accrue in the prior year. And also, we expect specifically in Q1 just due to the fact we've got this combination of both the unfavorable business mix from the top line pressure of Personal Systems, you combine that with the bonus payout and restructuring and with the increase in AR from contract manufacturers, which is partially offset by continued reductions we're taking at inventory level, we expect that our cash flow in Q1 is probably likely to be negative towards breakeven. So I know I've said a lot there is definitely a lot of factors going into driving the linearity in our cash flow. But once again, still very confident in the guide that we've given for the year of $3 billion to $3.5 billion. And then I'll just turn it to Enrique if he wants to comment at all with respect to our repo strategy. Enrique Lores : Sure. We can talk about that. We also shared in the prepaid remarks that we are not changing our capital allocation plan. But as we have said before, we are going to be returning to shareholders 100% of free cash flow unless better opportunities arise and always within the our -- where we will stay within our leverage rate. In Q4, we completed the acquisition of Poly. We did it one quarter before we were planning, and therefore, during the beginning of the year, we are going to slow down or moderate our share buyback to -- in alignment with our plan. But our plan is to go back to the original plan in the second half as we will have more stronger situation for a free cash flow perspective. And that's our plan. Marie Myers : Yes. I'll just add, it is important that we're going to ensure that we at least offset dilution from employee benefit plans as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. I'm wondering if you could specify how significant the backlog drawdown was in the quarter, just so we can get a sense of what kind of baseline normalized order of revenue growth was. And then you provided some context on your expectation for Q1 revenues for PCs to be down mid-single digits sequentially. I'm wondering if you can comment on your revenue expectations for Q1 overall and for fiscal '23. For the next four quarters, Dell is calling for revenues to be down in the teens. I'm wondering if you see a more optimistic outlook than that? And I have a follow-up, please. Enrique Lores : Sure. I'll take the question on market and then Marie will talk about Q1. So from an order and projection perspective, Toni, the way we are modeling the PC market for next year is to -- we are expecting that it will be declining by 10%. And from a backlog perspective, we basically cleaned the majority of our backlog during Q4. And we are back to where we were before the pandemic, which is one of the reasons why we expect the market to be in the minus 10% range in -- during 2023. Marie, do you want to talk about Q1? Marie Myers : So just on the revenue per PS, we do expect it to be down mid-single digits sequentially. And obviously, that's driven by all the conditions we've talked about earlier today. And as you know, we normally don't guide revenue, but we do expect that normal seasonality won't apply in '23. So we'll see some improvements in the overall revenue trajectory in the back half. But overall, we do expect to see PS revenue down here in Q1. Enrique Lores : And the situation is different on the print side, especially on the Commercial side, we continue to have some shortages as we were expecting. So backlog for Commercial print remains elevated and we expect to clearly during the first half of 2023. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. I still don't feel like we have a pretty good sense of what your range of outcomes is for revenue growth for 2023. But -- maybe you can address that. But just following up with the second question, you said Supplies would be back to your traditional model of down kind of low to mid-single digits. But you pointed to minus 10% growth in the first half. So that means you're expecting Supplies to grow in the second half. That's pretty well the simple math. And why did we have this big perturbation from model the last couple of quarters and maybe the next couple of quarters. Is this just channel inventory correction? Or why do we have a sudden reset off of model that is minus 3% to minus 5% and minus 10% and then it kind of bounces back. Enrique Lores : Sure. So as I explained in the last call, the changes in the performance in the supply business is really driven by a slowdown of Consumer demand. We started to see this at the end of Q3. And as we were expecting, we have continued to see that in Q4, and we project that this will continue. Of course, as demand gets adjusted, there is an inventory adjustment, but this is not the reason why we are seeing -- the impact in supply is really driven by adjustments in user demand. . For the full year, as we said last quarter and we continue to say, we expect the business to go back to our original guide. And this means that the second half will have stronger performance than the first half. I think as we look at quarter growth as one of the key metrics, I think it's important to realizing that adjustments done in previous quarter have a lot of impact on growth. So we don't think it's the best way to measure the health of the business because anything that happened a quarter ago will have an impact on what is the next quarter. But again, the big impact is driven by a slowdown on Consumer demand. And I think it's also important to highlight that our channel inventory is in a very good position today. I mentioned last quarter that it was slightly above where we wanted it to be. We are now totally within the position where we like to be. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yes. I've got two as well. Just going back to kind of Toni's questions a little bit. I guess on the context of the revenue side, just correct me if I'm wrong, the 10% number with regard to PCs being down, that's a unit number. So as we see ASP pressure come into play, would the assumption be that revenue declines more? And then also, on the revenue context, I think there was a comment thrown out there about 3% with regard to print. I'm curious, was that 3% sequential down in this quarter? Or was that kind of the commentary for the full year? I was just confused by that comment around 3% decline in Print. And I got a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Sure. Let me start with the print side, and then Marie will talk about PC. On the print side, the minus 3% is the expected decline in the overall market for print between fiscal year '23 and fiscal year '22, and there are different dynamics behind that number. We are expecting the Consumer number to -- the Consumer market to go down year-on-year, the office market to go slightly up and the industrial market to continue to grow like it has been growing during 2022. The net effect of all these three is a minus 3% growth year-on-year. Marie? Marie Myers : Yes. No. With respect to revenue, I think as I said earlier with Toni's question, we do expect to see down mid-single digits sequentially. And as we mentioned earlier, I think Enrique commented in the prepared remarks, down 10% on units, and this is obviously with an environment where you've got higher channel imagery, there is going to be some ASP pressure. So we do anticipate though, as you get into the second half, that should clear out the inventory that we'll see some of the revenue adjust. But I think the way to think about it is that certainly the first half of PCs is going to be challenged. But obviously, we will be doing our best to offset all of this with an improvement in our mix. And I think we've demonstrated that over the last couple of quarters. Aaron Rakers : Yes, that's very helpful. And then I guess the follow-up was on the channel inventory discussion. I guess, do you see that channel inventory is the assumption right now that channel inventory normalizes as we get towards the mid part of calendar '23. Any context of how you would currently characterize your own channel inventory in that? Marie Myers : Sure. If we're talking just Personal Systems, absolutely. We expect that the inventory will remain elevated through the first half, but then normalize in the second half. And then as I think Enrique said earlier, Print is in really good shape, both supplies and hardware. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Erik Woodring : I have two as well. Maybe Enrique I start with you. This is your third consecutive kind of three-year cost cutting or transformational plan, I should say, HP's third consecutive at more than kind of $1 billion of gross cost savings, each plan. So I guess if you take a step back and you think about the last maybe almost a decade in that context. Why have the prior plans, I guess, not been enough? Or what are you doing with this specific plan that you haven't necessarily already done, given even last summer, you talked about portfolio SKU rationalization and digital transformation. So just maybe if you could help us understand that. And then Enrique Lores : Sure. Thank you, Erik. I would say there are two things. First is the world is in a very different position now than when it was three years ago, but also the company is in a very different position. In fact, a significant part of the savings that we are going to be able to achieve now are really driven by the investments that we have made during the last 3 years that really are enabling a significant part of it. For example, when we talk about continuing to work on the digital transformation, we can do it now because of all the investments that we have made during the last three years. Additionally to that, when we look at the return on this investment, it really brings -- has very good results. We are going to be investing $1 billion, and we will get, as Mario was saying, $1.4 billion of run rate savings at the end of '25. So really very solid return. And on top of that, this will also help us to continue to invest in our growth businesses. We think that it is important that as we go through a challenging marketing conditions during the next quarter, we continue to invest in the future businesses of the company, and this transformation is going to enable us to do that going forward. Erik Woodring : Okay. And then maybe Marie, this one would be for you. Net debt is up a little $4 billion to $5 billion year-over-year. Obviously, Poly had an impact on that. Your gross leverage is creeping towards the higher end of your 1.5x to 2x range -- target range. And so would you be willing to go over 2x temporarily? I mean the math says, you could technically get over 2x over the next 12 months. So are you willing to let leverage get over 2x? And/or why not try to work down some of that just given the more uncertain macro backdrop, rising interest rates, et cetera? Marie Myers : Yes. No worries. No, we're very much committed to the strategy. I think we've articulated of staying inside our range. So absolutely, we'll continue to execute against our strategy. Enrique Lores : We think that the world is, as we have said, very volatile and having a strong balance sheet is really important. So this is why we will stay below 2, keeping investment-grade rating is critical for many of our big deals with large corporations. So this is one of the big reasons why we want to stay there. And if everything we will deliver, we are not planning to go beyond the range. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Ruplu Bhattacharya : It's Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. I have two questions. Enrique, one on PCs and one on print. In the prepared remarks, with respect to Personal Systems, you said that you're not happy with the share performance. It looks like HP lost some share, both sequentially and year-on-year. But I'm sure you've already done in this quarter what other companies are doing, which is reducing price. And with the inventory -- channel inventory remaining high for half of fiscal '23, can you talk about your strategy in Personal Systems. How do you think you can gain share? And what are some of the things that -- you talked about execution. So what are some of the things you can do better to gain share in this year? Enrique Lores : Sure. As we have explained in the past, our strategy and our goal is profitable growth is not to gain share for the sake of gaining share. And therefore, we are very judicious and very careful as we look at deals in different geographies, different segments to make sure that the deals make financial sense for us. This quarter, we saw very aggressive pricing in many countries in the world, especially in the Consumer segment, especially EMEA. And in many cases, we decided not to participate. But we also know that to maintain a strong leadership position in this market, we need to regain share. And this is -- and we think that the cost reduction activities that we have been working on for some time are going to be part of the Future Ready plan, are going to help us to be more competitive and help us to win share during 2023, which is our goal. And that's really the key -- this will be the key driver of the share growth that we expect to have. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Can I ask a follow-up on the Print segment? As people are going back to work, how do you see the relative growth rate of your home subscription business in spending versus the commercial Managed Print Services business are either one -- is one more profitable than the other? And then just as you look at print margins throughout the year, you guided for the full year to remain at the high end of the range. But should we think that the first half going to second half, your Print margins normalize somewhat towards within that range. So can you just give us your thoughts on the relative margins of those two subscription businesses? And how do you see the growth rates for them as well as the margin progression this year? Enrique Lores : Sure. From a margin perspective, similar to what happens on the transactional side, the home, Instant Ink program is more profitable than the Managed Print Service program. That\u2019s driven by the fact that we own almost all the technology stack. From a growth perspective, though, they are not related. We have a lot of opportunity to grow the consumer subscription business and to grow as well the Managed Print Service business, especially as we start seeing some slow but some recovery on the office side. Marie Myers : And just on the margins, as I said in our prepared remarks, we do expect to be at the high end of the range. But in terms of just how to think about it half-on-half, just in the first half, we do expect a little more softness in Consumer due to some of the favorable pricing. So we'll see that probably in the first half, some normalization. Operator : Your final question today comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Krish Sankar : I have two of them. First one, either for Marie or Enrique, on your cost reduction plan. With the portfolio optimization, how should we think about the TAM opportunity for HP in FY '25, given that I understand you want to do profitable growth. But do you think with the portfolio optimization and the headcount reduction, you're prioritizing one over the other? And then I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Yes. So our portfolio optimization have many different elements. Let me highlight a couple of them. First, we are going to maintain, and in some cases, increase our investment in the growth businesses. As I said before, we expect to get double-digit growth in 2023. And going forward, they will continue to become a more relevant part of the company. On the other side, we also know we have opportunities to optimize some of the businesses in the core side. For example, during 2021 and '22 because of the component shortages, we have to duplicate many SKUs. We had to duplicate investments in boards, in many different parts to compensate for component shortages. This is clearly now an opportunity to simplify, to rationalize and to reduce investment and cost in the cost side. And there are many other things, but these are two good examples of the things you will see us doing. Krish Sankar : Got it. Got it. Super helpful, Enrique. And then a quick follow-up, actually, a two-part follow-up. On the 10% PC units down, is that for FY '23 or is it for calendar '23? And can you just help us understand what your calendar '22 baseline is?  And then the second part of the question is, I think, Marie, you mentioned how second half of FY '23 should get better as inventory digest for PCs. I'm just kind of curious, is that really a function of inventory digestion and you expect demand to improve? Or is that -- because it seems like most companies expect a second half 2023 recovery, but with an uncertain demand environment, what is the confident level on that improvement? Enrique Lores : Sure. So let me start with a minus 10%. The minus 10% is what we expect the unit decline to be during our fiscal year that goes from November '22 to November '23. We are using that number because we think it's more relevant to understand the guide that we provided today. Marie? Marie Myers : Yes. And just on the second half, just bear in mind that not only the channel inventory will be in better shape, but we also will see the impact of the Future Ready Transformation program. So we'll expect to see those gross run rate structural savings that I mentioned about $560 million kick in, in the back half as well. So that's another driver along with -- we should see supply chain improved, particularly in print and high-end PCs. And I'd just add that at the high end of the guide, the upside is really coming from a better macro, but we're not counting on it. So that's what could drive us to the high end of the range. Enrique Lores : Thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. But you can see that we are taking the actions under our control to manage the situation and to improve the situation. Clearly, we know that we need to both continue to reduce our cost structure, but also to invest for the future of the company because I don't think anybody can predict when the rebound of the economy will happen. But what we want to make sure is that we have a stronger HP when this happened, so we can take advantage of that. So really thank you, everybody, for joining. And Happy Thanksgiving for those of you in the U.S. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Toni Sacconaghi : We are happy to have HP Inc.'s President and CEO, Enrique Lores, join us today. Just as a reminder, we do have Pigeonhole technology. So if you'd like to ask a question, you can submit it via Pigeonhole. I will pick it up on here and do my best to ask that. Enrique gets the award for most effort to get here. He arrived at the hotel at 2 :30 a.m. last night, because HP reported earnings in California yesterday after the market closed. And then \u2013 and Enrique flew here. So we're indebted and grateful for your effort. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Thank you for having me here. Q - Toni Sacconaghi : So maybe we can just start with a little recap of your fiscal Q2 which you reported last night. Maybe I'll just turn it over to you in terms of highlights that you want to speak to. Enrique Lores : Sure. We, as you said, we reported yesterday, and we defined the quarter as solid. We grew operating profit. We grew earnings per share, non-GAAP both, of course. But probably the most important thing was that we saw a recovery of demand, especially in the PC space, especially in commercial PCs. The PC business grew for the first time in eight quarters. And it was really driven by the performance and the progress that we saw in the commercial side. The Print business performed as we were expecting. We continue to see soft demand on the hardware side. Supplies were in line with our expectations. From a free cash flow perspective, we delivered on our numbers, and we continue to execute our plan to return free cash flow to shareholders, will return close to $400 million, and no changes as to the plan. So a solid quarter, and especially on the commercial PC side, lots of progress. And also, it was a quarter where we did a lot of innovation. We introduced a lot of innovation driven by AI, especially in the PC space, but also in other parts of the company, that we think puts us in a strong position for the coming quarters. Toni Sacconaghi : Great. And just to punctuate that, so I think normal seasonal growth is in commercial PCs is down about 7%. You were down 4%, so better than that, clearly. And you guided for PCs to be stronger than normal seasonal in the second half. Maybe you can talk a little bit about why you have that confidence in the second half. I think if anything, PCs were maybe a little disappointing in the first quarter. And so I guess you could say, well, was Q2 just a catch-up for Q1? And how do we really know the recovery is happening? So what are the things that you can point to that make you confident about continued momentum in PCs? Enrique Lores : I think there are two things. One is, from a seasonality perspective, the second half in the consumer space is always stronger than the first half just because of back-to-school and the holiday season. So this always drives on the consumer side, which is where we still see softer demand. We see the stronger seasonality in the second half. In the commercial side, beyond the performance that we saw this quarter, we saw also some more qualitative drivers that give us confidence about the performance of the business in the second half. One of them is the size of the funnel, the size of the deals that we see in the enterprise space. This is something that we monitor regularly, of course. And when we look at the funnel we have now versus the funnel that we had a year ago same period, is significantly larger. Second big \u2013 second driver is we know is during Q2, Microsoft started to publish pricing and specific timings of Windows 11. And we have started to see some of these deals driven by the Windows 11 refresh, which is also an important sign, something we were expecting to happen that we have seen starting to happen now. And then, and this is more a specific comment for the U.S., sales to the federal business in the first half were impacted by all the budget restrictions that many organizations went through. Some of these budgets have been released. We expect that there will be now an acceleration of deals in the federal space in the second half that will also help the commercial space. So there are not only the performance improvements we have seen, but also there are qualitative drivers that sustain the demand that we expect to see in the second half. Toni Sacconaghi : And you reaffirmed your free cash flow guidance and you narrowed your EPS range over the year. One question that we got, so I'll ask you, was your other income guidance is actually more favorable. So it was $0.7 billion, now it's $0.6 billion in terms of other income or expense in your K. That's about $0.09. But you didn't change your EPS guidance. So are you being conservative? All else equal, why was that kind of not bumped along in terms of the EPS outlook? Enrique Lores : Yes. As we said in the call, we continue to operate under multiple scenarios because we have seen an improvement of demand, especially on commercial, but we continue to see multiple potential synergies in terms of consumer and other factors. And we thought it was just better to keep the guide that we have had because, yes, there are some pluses, but there are also some other minuses. So it was better just to keep the number that we had before. Toni Sacconaghi : And just on the demand environment, you highlighted China as being an area of weakness. Can you discuss like what is happening there? Do you feel it's just general malaise both on the \u2013 in the economy per se? Do you think it's something HP specific? And can you dimension at all how important China is to your business? Enrique Lores : Yes. We have never shared the size of China, but if you look at the size of the PC business overall, is the second largest PC market. So this will give you an idea of it is a relevant market for us. And we really see market driven. For several quarters, we have been growing share. We didn't this quarter, but we don't see this as the key driver. Both on the consumer side and the commercial side, demand is very soft, is declining. I was in Beijing four, five weeks ago. And this is something you can experience when you talk to the team, when you talk to partners. There is a significant concern about the economy of the country in the country. They have problems with real estate, problems with unemployment of young people. And we think this is really impacting the willingness to invest and the overall situation there. We have operated for many years with significant restrictions on who can we sell, how can we not sell. Things have not changed. So it's not a new factor, but clearly, economy is a key thing that has changed. Toni Sacconaghi : And Enrique, you've talked about essentially returning all of your free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. The buybacks were $500 million in the first quarter, but they were only $100 million in the second quarter. Why was that? Enrique Lores : Well, we always operate within the same framework of returning 100% of free cash flow over time. We never made a commitment on a specific quarter what we will do. If our leverage ratio stays below two and if we don't find any other opportunities. And this continues to be the plan for the year. We don't look at it quarter-by-quarter. It is an over time plan. And investors should expect that during this year, we will be returning 100% of free cash flow. Toni Sacconaghi : But was there anything in the quarter, either the share price, or I don't think you triggered above your leverage ratio. So I'm just curious like why that wouldn't be like necessarily \u2013 and you're not matching it to free cash flow because free cash flow in first and second quarter weren't that different. So I'm just wondering like, why is \u2013 someone forget to push the button, or like why is that the case? Enrique Lores : I don't think there is really nothing relevant to share if someone forgot. Again, look at it from a long-term perspective, and we will execute the plan we have said. Toni Sacconaghi : You have a big future-ready plan, which involves a lot of cost take out. Where do investors see that? Because OpEx was up 5% year-over-year in the quarter, revenues were flat to fractionally down. So OpEx is actually outgrowing revenue despite the fact that you have really significant cost cutting. So can you explain sort of that apparent discrepancy and what's your framework for what percentage of the future-ready savings actually impact the bottom line versus be reinvested? And is that something we really see an operating \u2013 in gross margin as opposed to OpEx? And how do investors think about that? Enrique Lores : Yes. Let me \u2013 maybe it's worth spending a minute understanding the framework we have for cost. And the thing is very simple. If the revenue of the company is 100 and operating profit is 10, the cost that we need to work is [$90 billion], if this were 90. And this is how we define the goals and how we manage the future-ready plan, going after those [$90 million]. Also, if we find opportunities to improve the gross margin, but at the same time to invest in what we think are growth opportunities, we think this is good for the company for the long-term. And this is how we have been managing the plan and how we will continue to manage the plan. Where can you see the savings? Clearly, in the operating margins of both businesses. Both of them are probably at the highest level they have been. If you look at the gross margin level for both PS and Print, they have significantly improved over the last years even if demand has been soft, which is much harder to do. And this is clearly a consequence of all the cost work that we have been doing. Look at how demand has dropped and the fact that we have been able to improve gross margin, it's a strong signal of the progress that we are making. In terms of framework that we use, we have shared before, we have five growth \u2013 what we call growth areas. But investing on those, we think they will be bringing growth to the company. And now with the opportunity that we see in AI and especially in AI PCs, we have been also increasing our investment in that category, because this is an opportunity that we think we can lead and an opportunity that is going to create a lot of value for our shareholders. Toni Sacconaghi : Right. And is there \u2013 I mean if we think about the margin improvement, is it because you've taken out cost or do you feel the products have become sort of more value-add and richer and, therefore, you're capturing higher price/more margin as a result of that? Or is it the cost reductions are leading to effectively a lower bill of materials, et cetera? Enrique Lores : I think it's both. We have been doing a lot of cost across any area of the company from supply chain, simplification of portfolio, operational expenses, and across everything we have been driving cost down. But also one of the drivers of the business has been to shift our mix to more premium categories. But in some cases, also requires more investment, and also have better gross margins. So it's a combination of both elements. But there has been a lot of effort on cost. We committed to reduce our structural run rate by $1.6 billion by the end of next year and we are going to be making our call. Toni Sacconaghi : And is there a percentage that we should think in this plan and future plans of those cost savings that should be reflected in improved margin over time? Enrique Lores : We don't have a specific number, but if you think what we have done during the last few years, for both businesses, we have improved our operating margins. So three years ago for PS, we were \u2013 I think it was from 3.5% to 5.5%. We increased to 5% to 7%. And in Print, we also went from 18% to 19%. So this is where you'll see these improvements. Toni Sacconaghi : You talked about \u2013 we talked about the improvement in PCs in the second half, but you also feel a bit more confident in your ability to gain share in print in the second half. And I'm wondering why you see that and what changes second half relative to first half in terms of your belief in improving in print on a relative basis? Enrique Lores : Yes. First of all, the main reason why we have been losing share in print is because how aggressive some of our competitors have been able to be because of currency. And when we saw that currency was not changing a couple of quarters ago, we started a specific effort to reduce our cost on the printers \u2013 on the print side to be able to be more aggressive. This is something we said a quarter ago we were going to do. We have been working on that. And now we're in a position to be able to do that. That will allow us to grow profit \u2013 sorry, to grow share in a profitable way because our goal of profitable growth is very critical for us. So now we are in a position to be able to do that. And you can see that we have started to see that, especially on the office side, where quarter-on-quarter, we have started to grow share. And we expect that this will continue in the second half. Toni Sacconaghi : So you see the incremental cost cuts, but the yen has continued to remain unfavorable for you, like it's worse than it was two quarters ago. So it almost feels like a moving target. So do you feel you can get \u2013 so I appreciate the fact that you said about taking cost out, but it almost feels like the goalposts have moved further in terms of being more challenging. Enrique Lores : Clearly, the competitive environment has not become easier. But based on the projections that we have today and the cost actions that we have taken, we think we can grow share and this is why we shared it yesterday. Toni Sacconaghi : Right. I think I asked you this question or a variant of this last night on the earnings call, but just for the benefit of the group. If I go back to like pre-COVID levels, revenues were about $58 billion, this year, last year, $53 billion, $54 billion. To your point, operating profit dollars are higher and operating margins are much higher. But how do we interpret that? I mean do we interpret that as you're willing to trade off growth for profitability? Do we interpret that as you're kind of in a lull and you should naturally be going back to $58 billion or more? How do we \u2013 because I think at first blush, you could say, well, look, if I'm a shareholder, I actually prefer the fact that you have more operating profit dollars than if you had the same revenue and less operating profit dollars. But how should investors think about that? And what does that level say about what's either happened over the last four or five years or what we think should happen over the next two or three years? Enrique Lores : As always, there is not only one answer to the question, there are always multiple factors. If I start from where do we see the company going in the long-term, we think that what we share with \u2013 at our Investor Day last year of growing between 2% and 4% revenue continues to be our plan. And we think that demand is being impacted in the short-term, but we are maintaining the goal that we have there. So that's the first thing, thinking about the long-term. When we look backwards, there are multiple factors. One is some markets have become smaller, in other markets we have low share because we declared that we wanted to lose unprofitable share. And this was a big change that we started in print some years ago. Also supplies have been declining in the last five years, and they are relevant in the company. So there are multiple factors that we \u2013 that explain what has happened in the past. But when we look forward, we see the opportunity to continue to grow and to grow the company between 2% and 4%. Toni Sacconaghi : Enrique, if I stick with that 2% to 4% longer-term target, I think at your Analyst Day in October, you talked about sort of Print TAM around 1% growth in total, and [indiscernible] TAM around 4%, and so you would hold or slightly gain share. But if I just decouple the print side, you've guided to low to mid-single-digit declines in supplies for print. So that's 65% of your revenues this quarter, right? So 65% of your revenues are going down 3% or 4%, that means hardware at 35% of your revenues, in order to grow 1%, has to grow like six, seven. Hardware has been declining double digits. Is it really \u2013 how does that math work? Enrique Lores : You also asked me this question in the analyst meeting. Toni Sacconaghi : Hard work. Enrique Lores : Good. So our assumptions have not drastically changed. So if we look at the Print business, we \u2013 as you said, we expect supplies to decline low to mid-single digits, no change, and our models continue to support that. On the hardware side, we are going to be growing our business in the higher ASP segments like big ink and big toner where customers buy the printer and supplies, and this becomes more \u2013 and this helps from that perspective. Also, we are growing our services business in print, where we have made very good progress in the last year, really shifting our model and building the subscription model and extending it to other categories. We see opportunities to grow share in the office space, where compared to the overall Print business, we are underrepresented. And especially graphics continue to be a growth opportunity. So there are multiple drivers that make us believe that we will be able to do that. At the same time, at the company level, we are probably now more optimistic on the growth of PCs than we were before. And we haven't done, we published our long-term plans, but just looking at the impact that the AI is going to have on the PC category, we see a more positive impact than we were before. So we continue to see this growth of 2% to 4% as the right growth for the company. Toni Sacconaghi : Right. And so speaking of PCs and just your optimism this quarter and potentially longer term, if we just level set, so PC units were, depending on the source, 250 to 260 in 2018. It went up to like 350 in 2021, they were 260 last year. So kind of a round trip. How do you think about industry units for 2024? And how do you think about like medium to longer-term unit growth rate? And then we can talk a little bit about AI and stuff, but just on the surface, if you think about PC unit growth in the context of those historical numbers. Enrique Lores : Yes. We think that \u2013 our estimate for this year has not changed, is that it's going to be small growth in units, between, let's say, low single digits. And our estimate is very similar to what most of the industry analysts are publishing. So no big deviations there. Really it's more relevant that when we look at what categories in PCs are growing, we see more growth in premium categories, which from a revenue perspective is really helping to drive higher revenue growth than unit growth. And we expect that this trend will continue going forward. We think that the growth \u2013 we saw the impact of AI, which we can talk later, is going to be in the low, mid-single digits for PCs going forward, very similar to what we shared in our industry event about a year ago. And this is for PCs \u2013 for the PC market. Then if we add accessories or services, of course, the growth will be higher. Toni Sacconaghi : Right. Maybe just on could \u2013 what are you seeing in terms of competitive pricing dynamics today? And how do we think about that in the context of DRAM prices have gone up? So I think on a sequential basis there was some improvement in consumer pricing, and commercial pricing was maybe down. But year-over-year, I think pricing was down in both. What are the prevailing pricing dynamics? And how do we think about that in the context of component pricing? Enrique Lores : Yes. In the model that we have for the second half for PCs, we expect pricing to be flattish. And again, there are ups and downs. You mentioned commercial mix will be \u2013 commercial will be growing, which will be driving prices up. We will be repricing for memory every time we will be able to. So this will also help to increase prices up. We expect to see more pressure on the consumer side as we were talking before. Also education we think is going to be bigger, so this will also be driving price \u2013 average pricing down. So multiple factors up and down. Our expectation is that pricing will be flattish for the second half versus what we saw now. Toni Sacconaghi : And just when you say flattish in the second half, is that relative to a year ago or relative to the second quarter? Enrique Lores : Quarter-on-quarter or half on half. Toni Sacconaghi : Right. So stable essentially. And you mentioned that, on the \u2013 I don't know if you said education, you didn't say the word Chromebooks. But Chromebooks were kind of the leading edge of the strength in the pandemic in 2000. And so we're now at the like four-year anniversary of that. Are you \u2013 have you seen refreshes in Chromebooks beginning or maybe you saw them earlier than the last couple of quarters? And is that some \u2013 any kind of indicator for whether you start to see kind of the echo of this kind of boom and slow down cycle? Enrique Lores : Yes. So we have started to see a pickup of demand of education, and this, especially in the U.S., is a Chromebook opportunity. But as we have said before \u2013 and we expect this to continue. Next year, we are starting to see very big deals in many countries driven by education. There is a very public deal, for example, in Japan that will start happening in 2024, in 2025, and is 2025, 2026 that are many, many millions of units. But as we have said before, the overall Chromebook business is really not material at the company level. Not from a revenue perspective, not from a profit perspective. So yes, we are going to see a pickup, but it's not something that will really be impacting our results in a significant way. Toni Sacconaghi : Many millions sounds pretty good, though, here, Enrique. $1 million here, $1 million there can help. Enrique Lores : Yes. And we are going after these deals because we think it's good, but it's not like impacting the \u2013 a huge impact on the company. But yes, of course, they help. Toni Sacconaghi : Right. And you alluded to this before, but what are you hearing from corporates around end of life, Windows 10 end-of-life refresh? And is the strength do you think you're beginning to see or you are beginning to see on the commercial side, is this COVID replacements? Is this replacements because of Windows 10 end of life? What do you think is the predominant driver of \u2013 or is likely to continue to be the predominant driver of commercial strength? Enrique Lores : So far, I would say, has been more the aging of the installed base. So I think you call it COVID replacement. But we are starting to see Windows 11 refresh deals. And then it's hard to distinguish because when there is one, we do the refresh, so it's kind of the both. But we have started to see deals that \u2013 where companies have really starting the conversation from the need to reduce their support cost if they stay on the old system and the willingness to move to Windows 11. Toni Sacconaghi : Separately, if we look at market share dynamics, for many, many years until the last three or four years, the big three or the big five PC players were gaining share. And that changed a bit in the pandemic when those players didn't collectively gain share. And we're still sort of seeing that. Now why is that? And what are we likely to see over the next five years? I think the big five are, I don't know, 65% of the market now or \u2013 and there's one other big player, so the big six or 70-plus percent of the market now. So why has that dynamic changed? And is that temporary or structural? Enrique Lores : I think the key driver was the fact that during the pandemic, the competitive dynamics change and was more a supply-driven environment than a demand-driven environment. I think for the big players, demand-driven environments kind of help us more than supply-driven environments. And I think this is the major driver. Another driver that we need to see how it evolves is the fact that the three players are really much more focused now on more premium categories and volume categories. And the metrics you were sharing are more unit-driven than value-driven. I think this is temporary. I think this is going to change. But at the same time, our goal is not to grow share for the sake of gaining share. Our goal is to grow share \u2013 profitable share, which drives us more towards premium categories, to services, to accessories. And this is how we are defining the plan for the company. Toni Sacconaghi : Right. So it's taken me almost 30 minutes to really start talking about AI, which probably is a \u2013 shame on me as a tech analyst. So you talked a little bit \u2013 you have in the past and you talked a little bit more last night about the AI PC opportunity. And you talked about, I'll paraphrase, and maybe 10% of the units this year would be AI, you get a 5% to 10% bump on that, within three years, might be 60% of the units that are AI PCs. Is the benefit to a PC OEM like HP going to be principally in the higher realization of price? Or do you actually think the availability of AI PCs will accelerate or change replacement cycles? Enrique Lores : I think it's going to be both. I think that, clearly, average selling prices are going to increase, as you just said. But also customers will see the benefits that the AI PCs will bring, and applications will be supporting both \u2013 will be supporting those. There is going to be an acceleration of sales. For example, with AI PCs, you are able to \u2013 you will be able to do in your PC, many of the activities that today you need to do in the cloud. And this from a speed/latency perspective, from a data protection perspective, is a much better \u2013 and from a cost perspective, it's a much better model. On top of that, with the new models, and this is something that we only started to share a couple of weeks ago. Something we have done is the PCs now have a model that optimizes the performance of the PC for the specific user. The PC learns how Toni will be using \u2013 how you will be using your PC and will be able to optimize power consumption, CPU consumption. So it will really be a PC that is performing optimally for you. And especially for commercial PCs, there's going to be an increase on security. So as customers will start getting familiar with this new functionality and new value, we think this is going to accelerate the replacement cycle. Toni Sacconaghi : And if you think three years out when you said it could be 60% of PCs, how does that differ between commercial and consumer and why? Enrique Lores : We think it's going to be very similar. We think the adoption will start in consumer because especially large corporations need to go through a process of testing, making sure the PCs will work in their environments. And this evaluation takes time. But over time, we see penetration in both segments. Toni Sacconaghi : And how does the consumer become aware of that? Is it going to be channel partners? Is it going to be advertising? How does \u2013 is it going to be people walking in the stores, consumers walking in the stores and being upsold on it? But how does the consumer gain awareness of this incremental functionality and is proven? I mean \u2013 and how do they \u2013 and do you expect them to get it? Or do you feel like it's going to be a 5G event where there's so much talk about it, we all got 5G phones, and my 5G experience has actually gone down from my 4G experience. But I was doing it because the carriers were pushing it, and it ostensibly had all these benefits, but it hasn't really been the case. So I'm just wondering if consumers are on the front end, the clearly creative people, people who use AI intensively, will want an AI PC. But that's not the majority of people certainly not today. So how do consumers become aware and actually make the leap to buy an AI PC. And how much of that branding comes from you or from NVIDIA? And where does that message gets delivered? Enrique Lores : I think there are going to be multiple things. One is there is going to be a big push from all the vendors, including Microsoft, the silicon providers, to explain the value that AI PCs are going to bring. Also as applications will start supporting those, they will highlight that these new functionalities will only be supported by AI PCs. And also in the retail shops, there will be training events and communication events to explain that. Something that \u2013 and this is both common for both consumer and commercial, something we have seen is we need to do a big effort on training and communication in the coming months. So for example, in the commercial space, our resellers and our own sales teams will be able to explain the benefits. So you will see a lot of work from us. And I'm sure from some of our competitors, in the same direction. It's something \u2013 sorry to interrupt. It's something that has not been done in the PC space for a long time. Internally, we have defined this as a category creation moment because we realize that it's a category that needs to be created that requires much more effort than what we have done in many years in this space. Toni Sacconaghi : So if I just try and dimension, so if ASPs go up 5% to 10%, and 60% of the units move in three years, it's three to six points of price over three years. So that's one to two points accretion from price, if I just run your math through. And then there's a belief that there will be potentially some accelerated replacements that will happen. Are there opportunities for HP to be a channel for AI services or products? Like why wouldn't you get paid for preloading Copilot or other stuff? Enrique Lores : Let me move the conversation a bit higher because I think it's where you are going. I think the \u2013 we are about to see one of the biggest changes in terms of industry structure that we have seen in a long time. And this is going to have implications at all levels. It is going to have implications at the semiconductor level. We introduced for the first time, in a relevant way, ARM PCs a couple of weeks ago. And they have very strong performance on the semiconductor side, there are going to be significant changes. But also at the operating level, at the operating system level and the application level, the role of operating systems and applications is going to change. When today you open your PC, you get into the operating system and you have access to multiple applications. When you think about the future, you will not have so many applications open. You will have a prompt that will ask you, what do you want to do? And you will tell your PC, I want to create an application, I want to send an email to Toni and tell him how thankful I am for having been in his presentation. And by the way, the analysis of market blah, blah, blah is different. This is how you will interact with your PC. It's not by going to an application, operating certain applications and creating models. And this is going to be very disruptive. How all this will translate into what business models will be created, what opportunities to participate in where, is going to be different, and a lot of work is being done in this space. But I think is it's a point in time where we are going to see a lot of changes happening in the industry in the next three, five years. Toni Sacconaghi : I mean it's interesting that you said this was a category creation moment and that there's going to be disruption. Could this not be like a huge opportunity for \u2013 and maybe it's not, for PC OEMs to say, hey, we are the channel vehicle for those new products and services, right? I mean, we all know Apple gets paid $20 billion a year to be the default search engine. Apple is interviewing LLMs to be on its platform. Is there an analogy or opportunity here for PC vendors? Or is it because Apple is Apple and they control 50% of the customers and they have a unique OS and you either get Apple or you don't, whereas in PCs, if HP tries to charge me too much, I'll go to Lenovo. Lenovo tries to charge me too much, I'll go to Dell. And that all just \u2013 the industry structure doesn't allow for that? So how do we \u2013 because it's such a striking difference in terms of what Apple has been able to do as an access vehicle relative to what PC vendors have been able to do. And I suppose, I'm just thinking aloud here, that it's because Apple has a unique operating system, and therefore, you're either on or you're not, and in PCs there's much more choice. But again, if the big three or big five are going to have 75% of the share, is there an opportunity going forward? And how do we think about that? Enrique Lores : Yes. So probably my answer was too long to say yes. But it's not only at the operating system level, it's not only at the language model level, it's also at the silicon level. Because the more options you have, the more opportunities you have to negotiate and change models. Toni Sacconaghi : Right. Well, that's probably the most obvious and most immediate and the rest is sort of TBD depending on how \u2013 okay. Maybe we can talk a little bit about printing. How has the pandemic change printing, if at all? So you thought I was going to ask a really long-winded question. You reached for the coffee and you were kind of counting on that. Enrique Lores : Surprised me. Toni Sacconaghi : Never been this [hurt] before. That's a blast of acknowledgment there. Enrique Lores : So in two different ways. One is \u2013 actually, I'll go segment by segment, which I think is \u2013 it will be the best way to understand. On the office space, clearly, the amount of pages that is being printed is lower than before the pandemic. And this is really driven by what we call hybrid work. There are less people in the office every day. And this has driven the amount of pages down. And I use pages as a proxy because, depending on what happens with pages, happens eventually with devices. Before the pandemic, our estimates were that we were expecting to see an 80% \u2013 a 20% reduction of printing. And actually, we were looking at the numbers this week, and this is more or less where we are. The amount of pages is 80% lower than the pandemic. But as I said, I think it was yesterday on the call, the number has been fairly stable. Before the pandemic, the number of pages per printer was kind of going down. Since the pandemic, it dropped to 80%, and has been stable, which means probably as more people is slowly coming back, is maintaining the number of pages printed. But we are at about 80% of where we were. On the home side, during the pandemic, we saw a spike of pages printed. And since then, the number of pages has been declining, which was \u2013 which is what was happening before. But we continue to be above the level where we expect it to be. So that's from the home side, has been a positive impact from a pages perspective. And then on the industrial side, the business has been impacted during the last two or three years by a reduction of capital investments. But during the last 12 months, we started to see recovering. And we think that especially the second half after the big event that is happening these days in Germany, we think that demand is going to come. And from a pages perspective, we have seen, especially on the more industrial side, labels, packaging, very strong growth. That's how the three segments have evolved. Now, we\u2019ll drink fast. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. And Enrique, you talked, I think, a couple of calls ago about hardware units and revenues declining and how that could have a downstream impact on your supplies growth. And hardware has now been down like nine quarters, and I think units have been down like double digits for four quarters. Those are like pretty strong headwinds. So what \u2013 how do we think about that translation both near term and long term to \u2013 if your unit placement \u2013 hardware unit placement is below trend for a little while, like why wouldn't supplies go below your long-term trend forecast for a little while? What \u2013 how do we think about the forces there? Enrique Lores : Sure. I think the forces have not changed. And when we look at the projections that we have, we continue to see supply declining low to mid-single digits. So we haven't got from that band. At the end, there are four, five major variables that drive the supplies business going forward. One is the installed base, which we expect to continue to decline. Second is usage, that for both home and office we expect to decline. And then on the positive side, is what do we do with share of supplies and what happens with pricing of consumables, which during last year have been positive forces, and we expect for them to continue to be positive forces. And when we look at the combination of both, we see a positive trend. On the installed base, and this is something new, and we are trying to estimate what will be the impact because so far is only starting to \u2013 we are starting to see the impact. Something we are starting to notice is, as hardware sales have been declining, also the life of printers is being extended. And we are trying to quantify exactly how much is this. It's not yet in a big driver in the model, but we think it's also a natural effect, that long-term for supplies is actually positive. So it's something that we need to see in the coming months because we need to look at trends to really understand what is the impact. But it's another force that is starting to have an impact. Toni Sacconaghi : Right. And maybe you can just share some of your HP+ or subscription metrics. I don't think you provided an exact update on the call last night. But how should investors think about the percentage of supplies that \u2013 supplies revenue that are in some kind of recurring subscription? And what would be appropriate metrics there? Enrique Lores : Yes. I think we started what we call the business model change, I think it was five years ago now, or almost five years ago now. And we have been making very good progress, both in terms of \u2013 if you remember that the change had three major elements. One is shift to HP+ models that have a positive impact on supply share, growing the big ink and big toner categories that have also a positive impact, especially in emerging countries, and then the shift to subscriptions. And we have been making progress in all elements. One metric we have shared is the combination of HP+ plus big ink and big toner is about 50% of our shipments. So it's at a very good level. And we have been growing the number of subscribers and the amount of subscriptions that we offer, and we have now more than 13 million subscribers, so which is also a fairly solid number. And in the case of subscriptions, now we have three programs. We have one for consumables, for ink and toner. We have one for paper, so where you can get paper. And a few months ago, a couple of months ago, we launched all-in where you also have the printer. And really, we expect them to continue to grow in the coming months. Toni Sacconaghi : And the 50% of shipments, Enrique, that's obviously shipments like currently, not as the percentage of the installed base. Enrique Lores : Exactly. Toni Sacconaghi : And that's more likely to be on like an inkjet device, home device than on a corporate device. So is there \u2013 can you help dimension like what percentage of supplies revenue might be levered to subscription or ink and big tank? It's obviously going to be less than 50%, but is it like 5% or is it like 25%? Is there any metric that you've shared or can share? Enrique Lores : I think the one \u2013 the only metric close to this that we have shared is penetration of Instant Ink in shipments is above 25% in the countries where the program has been for the longest. So I think it's the only one that we have shared that will give you a proxy in this space. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. Maybe to wrap up, we can just talk a little a little more broadly. Just first about acquisitions. You have, for many years, talked about consolidation in the industry. Maybe you can speak to whether, A, it's playing out as you see; B, how HP thinks about acquisitions. I know the \u2013 you say that we're going to return all of our cash unless we find better value-creating opportunity. But what \u2013 maybe you can operationalize like what would be the kinds of things that you would look for, market adjacency, consolidation opportunities within existing markets, et cetera? So A, has the consolidation played out in the way that you thought? And B, when you think about acquisitions, what are the things that would be intriguing for HP? Enrique Lores : Sure. Let me start with B and then I will go to A. So M&A continues to be part of our strategy. It has been for the last years and it will continue to be. We have said that we are going to prioritize opportunities that will help us support our growth businesses. We think that we will be creating more value if we use our capital this way. This is what we have done in the past. And what we have done in the last three, four years is a good proxy for what we could be doing in the next three, four years. We bought Poly, we bought Apogee, we bought HyperX. These are the type of acquisitions that we will be \u2013 that we think will help us to accelerate our plans. And always, we are very rigorous looking at the strategy, the acquisition supporting the strategies that we have explained. Is it \u2013 do we think we have a strong operational plan to make it happen? And do we see good financial returns? We have a very strong filters that we have applied to everything that we have done in the past. And again, it's always in support of the growth strategies. In terms of consolidation, we continue to think that it is going to happen. There are \u2013 there has been some movements from some of our Japanese competitors in the last 12 months that support that. They have not been full mergers, but they have been looking at combining the R&D activities, combining their manufacturing activities, combining both. While they are keeping their brands, they are integrating their back ends, actually, in a fairly similar way to what we have been doing with Canon for a long time. But now we are starting to see these movements happening. And I will \u2013 as I have said many times, if I use a different words, doesn't mean that our approach has changed. It's just I'm using different words now, but our approach is the same. We think that, at this point, it's not in our plans. I will never say never that we will drive a consolidation acquisition. But our priority is more focused on the growth areas, the growth businesses where we see an opportunity. And now especially with AI, this can really help us to accelerate some of the conversations we were having on PCs or on peripherals that we think will be more accretive. Toni Sacconaghi : My last question is, what are the one or two things that you're most excited about and the one or two things you worry, keep you up at night? Enrique Lores : I think on the excitement side is the combination \u2013 how AI is going to be transforming our business. We have been talking a lot about the AI PC. But as you said, this is opening a lot of opportunities for disruption with our category that we want to be in the leading edge and that we need to really aggressively go after. And the first instantiation is what we are doing in AI PCs, but we see many opportunities to transform and to improve the rest of our businesses with AI. So this is clearly a very exciting thing. And second is all the opportunities we have to not offer just products, but really complete experience that we offer to our customers. And this is how many of our growth businesses have been defined, is about capturing more value per customers, offering them more value, of course. And when we think about opportunities in gaming or in hybrid experiences, all of them are really designed to see how we do that, either transactionally, or even better, as a subscription and as a service. And this is how our business has been built. In terms of concerns, it's probably the volatility that we still see in the world. It's difficult for us to control. But we clearly live in a complicated world from a geopolitical perspective, from an economic perspective, and things change very fast, and we need to make sure we change fast and we are ready to respond to whatever changes can happen. We haven't talked today, but from a \u2013 for example, from a supply chain perspective, we realized during COVID that we need to build a more resilient model. We are working on that, shifting where we have our factories, building a stronger model. We are also seeing \u2013 we were talking about the challenges in China, but we see opportunities to grow in many other countries where our presence has been smaller. So we are shifting also to respond to that. And responding fast to the changes in the world is both an opportunity but also an area of concern or an area of to really watch carefully. Toni Sacconaghi : Great. Well, thank you very much for your time. Enrique Lores : Thank you.",

Enrique Lores : Thank you, Orit, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. When we began our fiscal year six months ago, we were clear about two things. We said we would focus on the things we can control to navigate a demand-constrained market in fiscal year '23. And we said we would continue driving progress against our long-term growth priorities. Halfway through the year, this is exactly what we have done. And I am pleased to say the actions we are taking as part of our future-ready plan have started to take hold. Because of this, we delivered non-GAAP EPS towards the high end of our guidance and we have built strong momentum for the second half of the year. Today, I'm going to discuss our Q2 results and the progress against our future ready plan. I will then provide color on our business unit performance and I will close with some insight into how we see the balance of the year before turning the call over to Marie. Starting with our results. Net revenue was $12.9 billion, that's down 22% or 18% in constant currency. As expected, the industry-wide headwinds we described last quarter continued to impact our business. Against this backdrop, our teams did an excellent job controlling our costs, managing our pricing and shifting our mix. This allowed us to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.80. We also grew non-GAAP EPS and operating profit quarter-over-quarter. And we delivered on our year-to-date cost target, keeping us on track to deliver at least 40% of our three-year savings by the end of fiscal year '23. A key part of our strategy is to reinvest savings into innovation. We are doing this in our core business and our key growth areas. We believe this is very important because even though both our core and growth markets are impacted by the current macro environment, we see opportunities to further strengthen our position during this down cycle. Our innovation was on full display at our Amplify Partner Conference in March, where we launched more than 50 new products and solutions. This was our largest channel event of the past four years, attracting more than 1,500 of our top partners from around the world. It has sparked strong energy and momentum across our sales teams and our partners could see the significant progress we are making in our key growth areas. The benefit of our acquisition of Poly was one of our key areas of focus at the conference. Hybrid work is a long-term secular trend that we believe will continue to create attractive growth opportunities. We showed our partners how we are leveraging our combined hybrid system portfolio to create new solutions for customers. A great example is our new Poly video operating system, which uses AI-driven speaker tracking and auto framing to enable better remote collaboration. We also showcased the progress we are making in workforce services and solutions, including the launch of HP Wolf Protect and Trace. This is the world's first digital service capable of remotely locating, locking and erasing a PC, even if it is turned off or offline. And we unveiled new advanced computing solutions through our ZBook line including specific offerings designed for data science, AI and machine learning applications. Let me now give you some more color on what we saw this quarter in each business. Looking first at the market level, global economic uncertainty remains elevated. The macro environment is challenging across most geographies. We continue to see cautious consumer discretionary spending, while enterprises are delaying capital investments. With that as a context, Personal Systems revenue was $8.2 billion. That's down 29% or 25% in constant currency. Like last quarter, we estimate that the sell-out to customers exceeded sell-in to the channel, which means that end-user demand was stronger than revenue shipments. This helped us further reduce our channel inventory. There are still pockets where we need to improve, but we are making good progress as per our plan. Our PS operating margin was 5.4%, in line with our expectations. PS margins remained flat sequentially, reflecting our disciplined mix strategy and cost reductions in a competitive pricing environment. We delivered solid PS services growth with particularly strong performance in digital services. We also continue to improve our execution. Our teams are showing a relentless drive to win in the market. We gained PC share in calendar Q1, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. And we are not simply gaining share for the sake of share, we are gaining in more profitable areas such as commercial, where we now have the number one position and gained 2.5 share points year-over-year. We will keep acting with urgency to build on this momentum while improving our results in segments like premium and gaming. And while the broader gaming market is currently challenged, it remains a massive long-term opportunity where we continue to invest. This quarter, we launched a wide range of Omen and Victus gaming innovation incorporating the latest Nvidia RTX graphics technology. We are equally focused on the opportunities generative AI is starting to create for our PS business. We are actively working with our major software and silicon partners to engineer new architectures that will integrate AI applications into everyday use cases. This is a very exciting opportunity. In the same way, the Internet age fundamentally changed the way people use computers, I believe the age of AI will transform the role PCs play in our lives. Turning to Print. Revenue was $4.7 billion, that's down 5% or 2% in constant currency. We continue to see soft demand and aggressive pricing in the consumer print market. This was offset by favorable mix in our office business, including 10% revenue growth in commercial hardware and supplies performed better-than-expected driven by better demand in office. We delivered Print operating margin of 19%. This shows the continued benefit of our disciplined cost management as well as favorable pricing in office as we bring strong innovation to market. For example, this quarter, we launched a new line-up of laser jet printing systems designed to help businesses maximize productivity. We also continue to make progress rebalancing overall system profitability. Our HP+ and big tank printers once again represented more than 50% of our shipments in the quarter. We gained share year-over-year and sequentially in big tank and Instant Ink grew revenue and new enrollees. Just as we have done in Personal Systems, we need to improve our execution in Print to gain share. We aim to do this in a thoughtful way, focused on winning in the right areas to drive profitable growth and increasing our mix of profitable customers. Turning to our Industrial segment. Graphics continued to be impacted by macro headwinds. While flexible packaging and folding cartons are back to growth, this was offset by a decline in leveling. In 3D, the business returned to growth this quarter with good momentum in both plastics and metals. And we recently introduced our new HP Jet Fusion automation solutions, which simplify workflows and reduce cost for high-volume 3D production. Overall, this quarter's results show that we are making progress against our priorities. Yes, we have more work ahead, but we are continually upping our game as we execute our future-ready plan, and our teams are playing to win. We also continued to win the right way. Next month, we will release our annual Sustainable Impact Report. It will disclose the continued progress we are making towards our climate action, human rights and digital equity goals. As you know, this work is integrated into how we run the company. It has been an important factor of new sales wins for the past several years. And we see this trend continuing across commercial and consumer segments. Going forward, we are taking a more comprehensive approach to measuring the total business impact of our sustainability initiatives. Specifically, we have adopted the Corporate Knights Sustainable Economy Taxonomy. This is a well-established industry benchmark to measure what's called sustainable revenue. This measure allows us to quantify revenue generated from products and services that meet leading environmental standards and reduce our environmental impact. Using the Corporate Knights methodology, sustainable revenue represented more than 60% of our total revenue in fiscal year '22. Let me now turn to capital allocation. As we said last quarter, we plan to maintain our current capital allocation approach. We are applying the same framework we have used the last few years. We are committed to returning 100% of free cash flow to shareholders over time and less opportunities with a better return on investment arise and as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under two times EBITDA. As planned, we did not repurchase any shares in Q2 given where we finished the quarter on our gross leverage ratio. Looking ahead, we continue to expect our second half performance to be stronger than the first half. We see this being driven by improved channel inventory and seasonality, primarily in Personal Systems as well as the positive impact of our cost savings measures. Entering the second half of the year, we believe we have full line of sight to deliver on our structural cost reduction goal for fiscal year '23. We remain focused on optimizing our portfolio. We have talked before about creating a simpler, more focused company. There are many ways to deliver on this, such as reducing our number of SKUs rationalizing our portfolio or trimming our various lines of business. We will continue to approach this work in a way that enables us to best meet customer needs while creating value for our shareholders. We are also capitalizing on infrastructure investment to become a more digital company. This is driving greater speed and efficiency across our operations while enabling new value propositions for customers as we expand our services and subscription offerings. To sum up, we are confident in our future ready plan. We strongly believe we have the right strategy and team in place to deliver on our priorities and drive long-term sustainable growth and our continued execution of our plan will allow us to emerge stronger as the market improves. Let me now hand the call over to Marie to talk more about our financials and outlook. Marie Myers : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid financial results in Q2 against the backdrop of a tough macroeconomic environment. We generated sequential growth in non-GAAP operating profit and margin, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. Non-GAAP EPS was at the high end of our guidance range, while free cash flow was better than we expected. We delivered these results by remaining focused on prudently managing costs and optimizing our cost structure further under our future-ready plan. At the same time, we prioritize strategic investments that will help drive future growth when the macro economy recovers. We remain focused on what we can control in the current environment, which enabled us to deliver on our commitments for Q2. Now let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was $12.9 billion in the quarter, down 22% nominally and 18% in constant currency driven by the declines across each of our regions. In constant currency, Americas declined 21%, EMEA declined 22% and APJ declined 7%. Gross margin was 22.7% in the quarter, up 2.5 points year-on-year, primarily due to mix shift to Print and lower commodity costs in Personal Systems, partially offset by currency and competitive pricing, particularly in consumer print. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.8 billion or 14% of revenue. The decrease in operating expenses was driven primarily by rigorous cost management, including future-ready structural cost savings and lower variable comp partially offset by the Poly acquisition. In addition, recall last year, we provided aid related to the war in Ukraine. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, down 22.4%. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $172 million, relatively flat sequentially and up year-over-year primarily due to higher interest expense, driven by an increase in both debt outstanding and interest rates as well as higher factoring expenses. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share decreased $0.28 or 26% to $0.80 with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net benefit totaling $269 million, primarily related to restructuring and other charges amortization of intangibles and acquisition and divestiture-related charges more than offset by other tax adjustments and non-operating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $1.07, mostly due to onetime noncash tax benefits related to tax planning. Now let's turn to segment performance. In Q2, Personal Systems revenue was $8.2 billion, down 29% or 25% in constant currency. Total units were down 28% with declines in both consumer and commercial driven by weaker economic activity as customers in both market segments were more cautious with spending. Despite this, we improved our overall market share in calendar Q1 by 1.3 points year-over-year, driven by gains in the commercial market, where we improved our share by 2.5 points. Improved market share contributed to commercial representing greater than 70% of our revenue mix for the quarter, while constituting about 63% of our PC unit mix. We continue to make solid progress on reducing our channel inventory level sequentially, but levels remain slightly elevated for us and across the industry. As a result, we continue to see aggressive pricing in the quarter. We estimate sellout declined less than sell-in during Q2, which means that end-user demand was stronger than sell-in shipments. Drilling into the details. Consumer revenue was down 39% and commercial was down 24%. Lower volumes, FX and increased promotional pricing remained headwinds, partially offset by contributions from hybrid systems revenue. We increased our market share in high-value more profitable segments, including commercial and premium notebooks. Our strategy remains focused on driving profitable share growth. Personal Systems delivered almost $450 million of operating profit with operating margins of 5.4%. Our margin declined 1.5 points year-over-year primarily due to currency increased pricing competition and the higher OpEx due to the Poly acquisition. This was partially offset by lower costs, including commodity costs and structural cost savings and services mix. In Print, our results reflect our focus on key initiatives and improving execution within the context of a softer print market. In Q2, total print revenue was $4.7 billion, down 5% nominally or 2% in constant currency. The decline was driven mostly by lower consumer hardware and lower supplies revenue and currency. Hardware revenue was down about $100 million driven by lower volumes and competitive pricing actions in consumer, partially offset by an increase in commercial hardware revenue. Industrial Graphics revenue declined, reflecting continued demand weakness in the enterprise space. Total hardware units decreased 4%, driven by market share loss and soft home printer demand. By customer segment, commercial revenue increased 5% or 8% in constant currency with units roughly flat. Consumer revenue decreased 19% or down 15% in constant currency with units down 5%. ASPs were mixed. Favorable mix shift towards commercial helped to offset promotional pricing and incremental price reductions in consumer across multiple geographies to remain competitive. Supplies revenue was $3 billion, declining 4% nominally and 3% in constant currency, better than expected. The decline was driven primarily by lower usage as expected as home printing normalizes further a lower installed base and a gradual recovery in commercial. This was partially offset by favorable pricing actions last year and Lunar New Year timing as well as continued market share gains. Print operating profit was approximately $900 million, down 5% year-on-year and operating margin was 19%. Operating margin decreased 0.1 points driven by promotional pricing, higher commodity costs and unfavorable currency, partially offset by cost improvements and pricing actions. The cost improvements were largely due to lower variable comp and transformation plan related savings. Our future-ready transformation continues to build on our strong start through the first half of FY'23 and we remain on track to deliver at least 40% of structural run rate savings of at least $1.4 billion in FY'23. We continue to see significant opportunities to drive further structural construction across our business. Let me update you on our progress in Q2. We further enhanced our digital capabilities, driving additional automation and process improvements. In our Workforce Solutions and Services business, we harvested more proactive data insights from more connected devices with our enhanced diagnostic tools that drove repair cost efficiencies. In our supply chain, we delivered significant improvements in reducing portfolio complexity, improving continuity of supply and increasing our forecast accuracy to facilitate material cost and profit improvements. We saw further opportunities to drive structural cost reductions through headcount reductions and driving efficiencies in our core businesses. In Print, we focused on platform consolidations and road map reductions in our large format business. Looking ahead, we see potentially significant and incremental opportunities to leverage AI and generative AI to positively impact both our products and solutions and how we operate. We are actively exploring opportunities such as expanding our product portfolio to include a new category of high performance PCs, accelerating software development productivity and enhancing the customer service experience to drive higher value offers while optimizing pricing. Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Q2 cash flow from operations was solid at $0.6 billion and free cash flow of $0.5 billion was better than expected. Free cash flow results benefited from better purchasing linearity. The cash conversion cycle was minus 26 days in the quarter. This improved four days sequentially, primarily due to days payable increasing 10 days more than offsetting an increase in DOI. While we decreased our inventory by $0.1 billion sequentially in Q2, the upward pressure on days inventory was driven by strategic buys, increased ocean transit mix and a change in business mix. We have more opportunity to improve our core inventory turns and are focused on doing that. But when it is economic to do so, we intend to continue to drive value via strategic buys or more sea transit, both of which would result in carrying more inventory. In Q2, we returned approximately $260 million to shareholders via cash dividends. Given where we finished the quarter on our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter consistent with our outlook. We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy longer term, but near term, we'll continue to manage our leverage profile prudently and maintain an investment-grade credit rating in the current challenging environment. Looking forward to Q3 and the rest of FY'23, we expect the macro environment will remain challenged and we will remain focused on rationalizing our cost structure further while continuing to invest in our growth businesses. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. We are narrowing our FY'23 non-GAAP EPS outlook range, reflecting greater visibility into the potential range of outcomes for H2 '23. We still expect operating expenses, excluding Poly, will be down year-over-year for FY'23. For Personal Systems, we expect our and the industry's channel inventory will normalize in Q3 and the back half of the year will be seasonally stronger from an end-user demand perspective. We expect Personal Systems margins in Q3 to be in the mid-range of our 5% to 7% long-term target, driven by increased volumes, the continued progress on normalizing CI levels as well as further cost reductions and efficiencies. For FY'23, we expect margins to be solidly in our target range driven by the gradual improvement in PC revenue in the back half of the year and increasing future-ready transformation savings. In Print, we continue to expect suppliers revenue at FY'23 to decline by a low to mid-single digit in constant currency with easier year-on-year compares in the back half of the year. We expect print margins to be above the high end of our 16% to 18% target range for H2 '23, driven by disciplined pricing and cost management and continued progress on rebalancing our system profitability. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook for Q3 and fiscal year 2023. We expect third quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.91 and third quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.61 to $0.71. We expect FY'23 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.50, and FY'23 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.91 and $3.11. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion for FY'23. And now I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session.  And our first questioner today will be Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead Erik Woodring : Hey, good afternoon guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe Enrique, if I start with you. Just on some of the PC and Personal Systems commentary you made. Can you help us think how you guys are viewing the PC TAM in 2023. Why you have confidence in the back half recovery if you're seeing any signs of end market demand and specifically why you think the second half of the year could be above seasonal? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Enrique Lores : Sure. Thank you, Erik. So let me start by talking about what we saw during the first half, which really helps to understand our projections for the second half. During the first half, our performance was impacted by the channel reduction that we have been driving. And as I said in my prepared remarks, channel inventory continues to be slightly elevated, but we are almost there. What we saw also was that end-user demand was stronger than shipment, which is what really enabled us to drive these channel inventory reduction. When we think about the second half, usually, second half end-user demand is stronger than in the first half, mostly in the consumer side and driven by things like back-to-school or the holiday season sales. Now when we combine both, the fact that channel inventory will be normalized, which will help from a shipment perspective and also from a pricing perspective and we expect to see more normal demand following seasonality pre-COVID. This makes us believe that the second half will be stronger than the first half as we said during our prepared remarks. Erik Woodring : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe, Marie, I think you just posted your strongest gross margin and quarterly gross margin ever, I believe. But at the same time, we're seeing declines in PC units, Print units, supplies are declining. They're all declining year-over-year. So maybe one, were there any onetime benefits that you saw in the quarter? But if not, can you maybe help us understand the most important margin factors this quarter by maybe rank ordering. What was the most significant tailwind to margin strength? And maybe help us understand what was the most significant headwind, if you could quantify that, that would be very helpful for us. Thank you. Marie Myers : Yes. Sure, Erik, and good afternoon. So let me sort of give you a perspective first on PS and then I'll sort of flip to Print. So I mean on the PS side of the house, I'd say, first of all, definitely, we saw the strength in terms of the cost reductions, and we started our future-ready transformation program now a couple of quarters ago. And some of that was offset by demand, et cetera, and increased competitive pricing. But in addition, we actually saw very strong commercial rates as well. So all of that together helped to really contribute to the strong margin performance in PS. And frankly we expect to see that continue into the back half as well. Now as we get to the Print side of the house, I would say, you've seen very robust margins in print, and this is really driven by a few factors, everything from the portfolio, strong pricing discipline. We actually saw a really favorable pricing in the commercial side. And then once again, just like the PS side of the house, we've had the benefits of cost management coming from the future-ready transformation program that's are very much on track, Erik. Enrique Lores : And let me add a comment because there are always things that we could do better, but we are very pleased with the execution of the teams this quarter, both across Personal Systems and Print and this had a big impact in the results that we have posted. Erik Woodring : Thank you. Enrique Lores : Thanks, Erik. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess if I can start on the Print side. You talked about the margin improvement we're seeing there. But I'm just wondering, as you're reporting margins that are above your long-term range, it's hard to imagine that you're still seeing any benefit from supply chain constraints. You've done a lot of sort of -- you've taken a lot of actions around improving the upfront profit recognition subscriptions there. So as we think about these margins, should we think of them as more sustainable going forward relative to sort of how you probably imagine them 12 months ago? Just more curious about you can sustain these margins? And I have a follow-up. Marie Myers : Samik, I'd say we're still very much committed to long-term range of 16% to 18%. Obviously, we've seen some of the benefits as you mentioned from supply chain constraints, et cetera. And then as I mentioned earlier, with Erik, we've had the benefits of the portfolio, the pricing discipline, the cost management. I'd just add that as we sort of think around the back half and going forward, we do expect to see some continued pricing normalization. And ultimately, we supplies revenue will continue to decline, as we've said, low to mid-single digits over time. And so for those reasons, we expect that we will stay in that 16% to 18% operating range for the long-term, and it's the right range for the long-term, frankly. Enrique Lores : And maybe add one comment from my side. We manage the businesses to drive operating profit dollar growth. This is really what we are focused, and this is where our strategies are designed for. We provide margins because we think it will help all of you modeling the business and understanding where the business is going to go, but growth in operating profit dollars is a key priority that we have as we manage the businesses. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Got it. And for my follow-up, it's more of a clarification and maybe a follow-up to Erik's question partly. When I go back and look at pre-pandemic trends in PS, you've talked about, you've generally done a high single-digit quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in PS in the back half in both the quarters. Are you basically implying that maybe 3Q is a bit below seasonal and then you are above seasonal in 4Q just as you sort of get to all the inventory digestion in 3Q itself? Is that how should we be reading into your guidance? Thank you. Marie Myers : Yes. Maybe I'll take that one. So what we expect is that PS Q3 revenue is expected to be in the high single digits sequentially. So we're getting back to what you typically see from a seasonality perspective. And then Q4, obviously, we'll see greater volumes as Enrique pointed out, because that's our typical holiday season as well. So I think the way to think about it is we're starting to see more the normalized seasonality trends return back. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you for taking my question. I'm just wondering if you can comment on OpEx and SG&A sequentially from Q1 to Q2. What the forces that work were there and how we think about the trajectory of operating expense over the course of the year, do you expect most of the savings from your restructuring actions to actually help OpEx? Or will we see that more on the gross margin line? And then I have a follow-up, please. Marie Myers : Hey, Toni. Good afternoon. Good to hear from you. So maybe I'll start out with the back half of the year first. So we do expect OpEx to be up in the back half. And that's because it's going to be driving both our contribution to some of the growth and investments that we're doing in our growth areas and also in our people. But in terms of where the savings are going, they're going to both cost of sales and OpEx. And as you look at the sequential OpEx, you asked me both sequential and year-on-year. Sequentially, we did see an increase, and that was primarily due to some external funding that we had in R&D that we received in the quarter plus we had some incremental investments and we had some unfavorable currency and bad debt. And obviously that was offset by future-ready savings and expenses. But on year-on-year, you did see a decline, and that was due to expense management, the work we've done around future-ready. And last year, we did have some onetime contributions for aid relief in the Ukraine. So that's how to think about OpEx. And obviously, future-ready, we're pleased with our performance so far and we're looking at new programs as the program continues to mature. But essentially, it's both cost of sales and OpEx and we are on track to achieve the numbers that we talked about earlier. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. If you could just clarify when you say that OpEx will be up in the second half, is that from Q2 levels or in absolute dollars? Is that how you're thinking about? And then just my follow-up is maybe you can provide a bridge from EPS to free cash flow or from net income to free cash flow. So I think your net income is going to be about $3.3 billion at the midpoint of your guide. You have restructuring charges of $400 million. I would imagine if your PC business is continuing to decline, that working capital will actually be a headwind on free cash flow. So how do we get to your free cash flow range if we start from net income? What are the puts and takes, please? Thank you. Marie Myers : Yes. Maybe I'll start on free cash flow and then I'll go back and answer your question on OpEx. So in terms of free cash flow, Toni, let me start out by saying that, obviously, you saw results in the quarter and certainly they're better than expected. But as you know, Enrique commented here a moment ago, the sequential growth in Personal Systems is really driven by that negative cash conversion cycle. And that's a very important factor as we think about the second half. And obviously, this is going to drive a material improvement in CCC in terms of the actual business mix. And as Enrique said, just with the second half, PS will have a substantially stronger Q3 and then ensuing Q4, and that will obviously drive the cash flow as well. And I'll just might add, as I said in the last quarter and I think in the prepared remarks, we're also looking at capacity for strategic buys and shipments. So we're going to make sure that if we may not see a material improvement in inventory just due to that. Now in terms of OpEx itself, we do expect to see an increase in the second half. As I mentioned earlier, Toni, some of that's because we're investing in some of the growth initiatives from our future-ready savings and some of it is the investment we're making in people. But just a reminder that year-on-year, we still expect OpEx to be down. But if you think about the back half of last year, we did take some fairly significant actions. So just keep that in mind when you think about the back half compares as well. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Enrique Lores : Shannon you might be on mute. Shannon Cross : I was on mute. I am so sorry. Thank you. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I'm curious the AITC commentary. Can you flesh that out a bit in terms of where you see the opportunity, timing? I guess I'm a little concerned that people right now have x amount of IT dollars to spend. And obviously, there's a big sucking sound coming out of all of the AI initiatives. So how do you see your PC offerings fit in? And when do should we expect to see some benefit? And then I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Sure. Let me start by saying that we are really excited about the opportunity that this is going to bring because we really think it's an opportunity to redefine what PCs are redesigned, the value that PC brings and be a big, big driver of refresh, both in the commercial, but also in the consumer space. What we are working on is to build AI capabilities in the PC. So consumers or professionals will be able to run AI applications at the edge and will not have to run them on the cloud. The benefit this will bring is that if you're a small company and you want to use some of your private data, your confidential data to in an AI application, you will not have to upload it, you will be able to run it locally. And also there will be advantages in cost and advantages in latency. What this requires is a new architecture of PCs that combine program, processors with AI processors or GPUs. And this is the work that we are doing with the key silicon providers to make sure that their new designs are integrated into our PCs and into and really help to drive this new value. There's going to be a significant change. Customers will start seeing some of these solutions available in 2024 about 12 months, 20 months from now, and it's going to be a huge opportunity to really bring energy to the category. Shannon Cross : Okay. That's helpful. And then -- in terms of the printing business, I know there's been talk about moving more to subscription. And you obviously are doing it for ink, but then just start adding in hardware. So I'm wondering, and maybe you can talk about PCs as a service, too. But I'm just curious how we should think about as you consolidate your SKUs. How you're thinking about new -- more recurring revenue business model. Enrique Lores : Yes. So as we have said before, growing our subscription business is one of the priorities that we have. And over time, we want to offer the majority of our portfolio as a subscription. As you said, we started offering ink, we have extended into toner. We have also -- we are offering now also a paper subscription that really grew -- has been growing very fast during the last quarter. And during this year, we will start introducing the first printers as a subscription and we will start by offering that to customers that will be already in the program. We think this is really important because it enables us to capture more value per customer. We are all -- and we do that because we offer a stronger value proposition. NPS is higher in subscription models, and we really see this as an opportunity to grow and expand our businesses in the future. Shannon Cross : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Ng : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. It was encouraging to hear about the continued expectation for the normalization of PC channel inventory next quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about whether you expect sell-in to also return to growth as we approach the latter part of the fiscal year? And what do you expect to happen from a pricing perspective, both from an industry perspective and then also for HP? Thank you. Enrique Lores : Yes. So let me take that question and maybe Marie wants to complement. So from a channel inventory perspective, we expect it to be normalized in Q3 and exit Q3 we channel at normalized levels. What this will mean is especially in consumer where during the first half, including Q2, there have been significant promotional activity. This will have a positive impact on pricing since those promotions will not be necessary anymore. And as I said before, what we also expect is that end user demand toward customers will really be buying to be stronger in the second half than in the first half following normal seasonality. From a revenue perspective, what this will imply is that second half will grow versus the first half, which will have a significant impact on free cash flow, as Marie was saying before and is one of the key drivers of the free cash flow generation that we expect to see in the second half. Marie Myers : I think you said it all, Enrique. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Michael Ng : Great. Excellent. Thank you very much for that, Enrique. And just as a quick follow-up. I was just wondering if you could update us on your industry PC selling expectations for this year. And any comments you can make about the new size of the installed base relative to pre-pandemic labels. Thank you. Enrique Lores : Sure. We have not significantly changed the expectations that we have in terms of the selling size of PC market this year. We continue to believe that it will be in the $250 million to $260 million unit range, very similar to what it was in 2019, pre-COVID. We also think that the market is going to grow beyond that. We think that the fact that the installed base is bigger than it used to be, the new applications that we see especially driven by hybrid work that requires better cameras, better audio, better systems are going to be all positive drivers. And in '24 and beyond, we expect to see growth. Specifically, what we expect to see in '24 and '25 is something that we will be -- we are working on that, and we'll be sharing the details during the next quarter. Michael Ng : Excellent. Thank you for all the thoughts, Enrique. Really appreciate it. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. You mentioned strategic buys a couple of times. I was wondering if you could talk about the component pricing environment for you and where you're specifically thinking about strategic buys and I have a follow-up. Marie Myers : Yeah, hey, Wamsi, it's Marie. So look, I think as we said last quarter that basically, look, even though we're focused on driving inventory declines operationally, we said we'd take advantage of strategic buys and frankly, lower the ships where it made economic sense. And so we have continued to do so, and we will continue to do that in the back half of the year. And I think then your second part of your question was around commodities and what the outlook is on commodities. And so I just said for PS, we do expect to see declines sequentially into Q3. Q4, slightly different situation because we expect, as Enrique said earlier, there's going to be a bit of a demand recovery. And plus coupled with some of the comments you're seeing from commodity suppliers that's potentially scaling back on production, that's likely to result in some price increases in the basket of commodities. So that's how we're looking at commodities in terms of the back half of the year. Enrique Lores : And let me reinforce the comment that Marie just made. Operationally, we are going to be driving HOI down because as we have said before, we increased HOIs during the pandemic. We think we can operate with lower levels of HOI. But at the same time, if we see opportunities to do strategic buys or to increase the amount of product that we send by both, which has lower cost, is something that we will do even if it has implications in terms of HOI because they have both have good financial return to the company and they are both good decisions. So this is something that we manage very carefully, but if we do it, it's because we really see the economic value behind those decisions. Marie Myers : And I'll just add to Enrique's comments that all of that is reflected in our guide as well too, Wamsi. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thanks for that. And as a follow-up. Clearly, you mentioned this promotional pricing in PCs. How is the elasticity of demand response to that promotional activity? And as you think about the back half of the fiscal year, is that increase in PC growth largely coming from consumer or commercial? And what kind of impact do you expect on margins? Thank you. Enrique Lores : Yes. The impact of pricing that I was mentioning before was mostly in consumer, where we saw the need to drive more promotional activities. As we look at the second half, we expect consumer pricing to slightly improve as the situation will normalize from an inventory perspective and we expect to see stability in prices on the commercial side. Marie Myers : Yes. And I'd say just from a guide perspective, if you look at PS, our Q3 op margin is in the range of 5% to 7%. So it would incorporate what Enrique said and plus just to reiterate that we see very strong commercial margin rates right now, too, as well. Wamsi Mohan : Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my questions as well. I guess, Enrique, maybe to start with -- it's been a fair bit of talk on PCs, but as you think about the back half performance being better than the first half, can you just touch about -- how do you think about the Print segment stacking up in the back half across both consumer, commercial and supplies. It would be helpful to understand how you think Print ramps up in the back half, given the fact you're talking about a better -- stronger back half versus first half? Enrique Lores : So let me talk briefly about print. I think for -- during the first -- during Q2, two things to highlight. Clearly, supplies performed better than we were expecting, and this was more driven by stronger demand on the office side. And also, actually, we saw a bigger market in the office space than we were expecting, which is really related to the previous comment. When we project and when we look at the second half, we expect Print to continue to perform at similar levels in terms of operating profit that we have seen in the first half. And some of it will be supported by stronger growth in the office side, really leveraging and being driven by the trend that I just explained. Marie Myers : And I'll just add with respect to the margin ranges that we also expect to see the continued impact of cost management from our transformation costs as well in terms of supporting the margin outlook. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And then I guess, Marie, when I think about the free cash flow cadence, and you sort of touched on this earlier, but you expect a bigger back half recovery about $3 billion of free cash flow I think in H2 roughly on better PCs, as you talked about and a few other things. I guess maybe just talk about do we start to think about as free cash flow improves in the back half and just logically, your net leverage comes down, buyback should resume as well in the back half. Is that the right thing to think about the buyback cadence or is there different things you're going to look at when in terms of deciding when to restart the buyback program? Marie Myers : No, great question, and thanks for asking. And you're absolutely spot on. We do expect that our leverage should trend down through the back half of the year. And to your point, based on the real strong cash flow that we're going to have, we expect that we will actually have room and actually repurchase shares in Q4. So you're absolutely spot on. Thank you. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead Robert Mertens : This is Robert Mertens on for Krish. Thank you for taking my question. Just in terms of a quick question back in the channel inventory commentary. I know you've gone through quite a bit, but just in terms of when you would think normalization would happen, is that something during Q3 or something you think could happen exiting the year this year? And then I have a quick follow-up. Enrique Lores : It will happen during Q3. So we expect to exit Q3 with normalized channel inventory levels. Robert Mertens : Great. Got it. That's helpful. And then just in terms of looking at the print business, is there any sort of ramifications for the recent merger with Toshiba, how you think about strategically the Print market as a whole there? Enrique Lores : No, no changes in our approach. I think what this shows is the need to look for opportunities to find efficiencies, especially given that the Print market, the office side is going to be smaller than what the projections were before COVID. And this is what we have been doing during the last multiple quarters. The significant part of the $1.4 billion of savings that are part of our future-ready plan will help on the Print space and really our focus is on driving growth organically when we announced last quarter that we were creating the Workforce Solutions and Services business, growing our office business, growing our office business contractually is one of the key priorities for the team and we are making good progress there. Robert Mertens : Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Enrique Lores : Thank you Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead David Vogt : Great. Thank you guys for taking my question and I apologize if this was asked. My line had a bit of a problem. So maybe Marie just a bit of clarification. I think you mentioned that PSG margins would be sort of in the middle of the 5% to 7% range in the third quarter. But Enrique also mentioned. You would see relatively stronger growth sequentially because of consumer, which I think has a lower segment margin. So can you kind of talk through how do we bridge the gap from five, four in the second quarter to something notably better in the third quarter? And then I'll just give you my follow-up while I have you. When I think about the second half of the year, I think about normal seasonality, typically, Q4 is up mid to high single digits versus 3Q as you build into your fiscal fourth quarter. Is that how we should be thinking about it because that would imply that the PC units would be down, I guess, again, year-over-year, high single-digits. Is that kind of how we're thinking about the second half of the year? Thanks. Marie Myers : Yes. So maybe I'll take the second half of the year and then flip to the op margin question. So look, the PS revenues expect to be high single-digits going into Q3. And then think about the back half as being seasonally stronger and lining up more with normal seasonality. So from an op margin perspective, let me quickly go there. So just to clarify, Q3, we expect to be in the mid of the 5% to 7% long-term range, the year in the range. And then as you go to Q3 to Q4, just bear in mind that we're going to have the benefit of commodity cost reductions, cost management, better volumes, impact of future ready and then we're going to have stronger Q4 volumes, much stronger than Q3 and all of that will help to drive the op margin in Q4. So hopefully then that gives you sort of some context that combined with what I mentioned earlier around the strong commercial margin rates as well. So all of that combined will contribute to the strength that we're expecting to see in Q4. And then in terms of just the PS rate being solidly in the long-term range in the year. David Vogt : Got it. And maybe I can slip one in. So does the buyback -- the high end of the guidance contemplated by the buyback picking up later this year? Is that kind of how we think -- should think about the high end of the full year guide? Marie Myers : So the high end of the guide, basically, it reflects that -- you saw we took $0.10 off. Originally, we had the high end actually representing the macro. So the high end today just reflects the range of scenarios that we have. And look at as always, it's a prudent guide. If we can do better, we absolutely will. Like I said earlier, I think to, Amit, we do expect we'll have capacity in Q4 based on the strong free cash flow, and that's when we would expect to buy back shares. David Vogt : Perfect. Thank you. Marie. Marie Myers : No worries. Enrique Lores : Thank you. And let me now take an opportunity to close the call. I wanted to, first of all, thank everybody for joining today and also share that we are currently planning for our next Analyst Day event. We will provide more industry information as we close the details of the plan and we will do that as soon as we have that. So thank you, everybody, for joining. Looking forward to talk to all of you soon. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

My name is Sarah, and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Orit Keinan-Nahon: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Marie Myers, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is a webcast, and a replay will be available on our website shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the earnings release and accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at investor.hp.com.

For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Enrique. Enrique Lores : Thank you, Orit. And thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. When we spoke last quarter, we said that our second half performance would be stronger than the first half. We outlined a clear plan to drive sequential improvement and this is exactly what we delivered in Q3. We grew net revenue, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow quarter-over-quarter in a tough market environment. And our Future Ready plan is enabling continued progress against our long-term growth priorities while driving structural cost savings. Today, I'm going to spend a few minutes recapping Q3. I will then talk about the market dynamics we see in each of our business units. And I will close by sharing my thoughts on the external environment heading into Q4 before handing the call to Marie. Starting with our results, net revenue was $13.2 billion. That's down 10% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. Even so, third quarter net revenue was up 2% sequentially despite macro headwinds continuing to impact demand across the industry. We also made good progress in our key growth areas. While these businesses are not immune to [covering] (ph) market challenges, collectively, they delivered solid sequential growth in the quarter. This reflects the power of the portfolio we are building to meet a wider range of customer needs. And we are continuing to invest in these areas to strengthen our position and accelerate our momentum. We remain on track to deliver at least 40% of our three-year structural cost savings target by the end of this fiscal year. And I want to thank all of our teams for driving disciplined execution and cost management across the business. Because of their work, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.86. This is at the midpoint of our previously provided guidance and was up 9% sequentially. As we reduce our structural cost, it's enabling sustained investment and innovation aligned with our long-term growth priorities. At SIGGRAPH, we launched our new Z4 Rack workstation for data scientists, content creators and engineers. With the option of our HP Anyware remote computing software, users can access the high performance power of the Z4 from any device. At Computex, we introduced our next-gen HyperX Cloud III gaming headsets, which creates immersive audio experiences for gamers. We unveiled our new Poly Studio video solution for hybrid meeting rooms. It runs on AI-driven software that automatically detects and frames participants to enable a better experience between people in the room and colleagues connecting remotely. And we launched HP SitePrint, an innovative robotic solution that empowers workers to print the most complex construction site layout with pinpoint accuracy while achieving 10 times their productivity. I am even more excited about the progress we are making with our silicon and software partners to co-engineer new platforms that run generative AI at the edge. As I mentioned last quarter, this is a massive opportunity for PC reinvention. Being able to run AI applications locally enables lower latency as well as more robust security and privacy protection. I am very pleased with pipeline of innovation our teams are building, and we view this as a significant driver of PC refresh in 2024 and beyond. We will be unveiling a wide range of new products and services at our first-ever HP Imagine event on October 5. This is a moment for us to showcase innovation across our portfolio, and I invite you all towards the live stream. Last quarter, we also released our annual Sustainable Impact Report. It outlines the progress we have made against our climate action, human rights and digital equity goals. We have now reduced our absolute carbon footprint by 18% since 2019. And we achieved our goal to enable better learning outcomes for 100 million people three years ahead of plan. I hope many of you were able to watch our webcast on these topics earlier this month. This work has a positive impact on our communities and helps us to win business. Let me now turn to our business unit performance. Starting at the macro level, we continue to navigate an uneven environment, including FX headwinds. From a customer segment perspective, the picture is somewhat mixed. We are seeing enterprise spending remain cautious, with a rising cost of capital being a notable factor. The SMB segment is showing resilience. And in consumer, we continue to see softness in discretionary spending. Geographically, we see various dynamics playing out in different parts of the world. Most markets are experiencing some weakness, although at different levels. For example, we saw a downturn in the China market, where demand is not even yet back in the lower GDP recovery. Personal Systems revenue was $8.9 billion in the quarter. That's down 11% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency. Even so, we saw a significant improvement this quarter with PS revenue up 9% sequentially. This reflects back-to-school demand as well as higher unit volume resulting in share gains. Our PS operating margin was strong at 6.6%. Operating profit dollars grew sequentially, driven by higher volume, our disciplined cost management and structural cost reduction. We also gained share in both Commercial and Consumer while still focusing on profitable share. Year-over-year, we gained 2.9 share points while retaining our number one position in Commercial. Gaming saw a significant recovery with double-digit sequential growth. And PS services TCV grew strong double digits sequentially and year-over-year. Turning to Print, revenue was $4.3 billion. That's down 7% year-over-year or 5% in constant currency. We continue to see soft demand, particularly in China as well as aggressive pricing in the consumer print market and delayed enterprise spending in the industrial space. Supplies revenue was broadly flat year-over-year in constant currency, in line with our expectations. We delivered Print operating margin of 18.6%. This reflects our disciplined cost management as well the work we are doing to rebalance overall system profitability. For example, this quarter, about 60% of our shaped units where HP+ enabled or profit upfront big tank printers. And Instant Ink once again grew revenue and new enrollees year-over-year. We also see opportunities to improve our Print performance. We are specifically focused on regaining profitable share and improving our performance in office through stepped-up execution. And given the competitive environment in home printing, we need to improve our cost structure to maintain long-term profitability. Turning to our Industrial business. The graphics and 3D markets continue to be impacted by macro environment and delayed ordering cycles. That said, they remain important parts of our plan to drive long-term growth and value creation, and we continue to innovate to strengthen our position. I also want to acknowledge the continued progress we are making in our workforce services and solutions business. We delivered solid growth in the quarter, both year-over-year and sequentially. And we are building a strong funnel as we spend time introducing our newly integrated portfolio of services with customers. We are very encouraged by the opportunities to grow this business moving forward. Overall, Q3 was a solid quarter, given current market conditions. Our Future Ready plan is on track. We're investing in innovation and making good progress against our long-term growth priorities, and we are doubling down on execution across every facet of our business. This is important as we expect the market to remain challenging in Q4. The macro situation is not improving as quickly as anticipated. And while we expect to deliver another quarter of sequential growth, we are moderating our expectations for Q4 and the full year, consistent with the revised market outlook. This outlook is largely driven by the continued aggressive pricing environment in PCs, sluggish demand in China and enterprise demand [Technical Difficulty]. Notwithstanding the actions we are taking to mitigate these headwinds, we believe it's prudent to lower our outlook based on near-term market reality. Let me be clear. We will use this moment as an opportunity to double down on the things we can control. We have already begun identifying additional opportunities to further reduce our cost structure where we believe we can overdeliver on our cost saving target. This is certainly not the first time we have had to adapt market volatility. It's something we have been doing consistently over the past few years. We know how to manage the business through this situation. And we have a strong track record, taking actions that protect our profitability and free cash flow, which is what you can continue to expect from us. And while we clearly have some additional work to do in the near term, we remain confident in our long-term trajectory. We have consistently said that progress won't always be linear, but we are focused on what we can control and driving disciplined execution to unlock value. We will also continue to execute the capital allocation strategy we have shared previously. We are committed to returning 100% of free cash flow to shareholders over time unless opportunities with a better return on investment arise and as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under two times EBITDA. I'm looking forward to seeing many of you in Palo Alto in October for our Securities Analyst Meeting. As many of you know, this was an event we hosted each fall prior to 2020. We hosted it virtually in 2021 and it will be great to be back together in person. We will use the meeting to share more detail on the progress we are making against our Future Ready plan, including some of the opportunities we see to accelerate our digital transformation and structural cost reduction. We will also highlight exciting innovation across the HP portfolio. And we will talk a lot about the significant long-term opportunities we see to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value creation. With that, let me stop here and turn the call over to Marie to discuss our results and outlook in more detail. Marie Myers : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered positive results in Q3 and continued to build on the progress we made during the first half of the year despite the challenging macro environment. We have increased our non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP EPS sequentially over the course of the year in line with our outlook. In Q3, our Personal Systems business drove high single-digit sequential revenue growth, which in turn helped drive strong free cash flow performance in the quarter. We successfully completed a debt tender exceeding $1.1 billion late in the quarter that reduced our gross leverage ratio as planned. And our Future Ready transformation plan is on track to achieve at least $560 million in gross annual run rate structural cost savings this year. While there are pockets of our business where we are working to improve our execution, we made good progress during the quarter. Now let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was $13.2 billion in the quarter, down 10% nominally and 7% in constant currency, driven by the declines across each of our regions. In constant currency, Americas declined 8%, EMEA declined 5% and APJ declined 9%, driven by weakened demand in China. Gross margin was 21.4% in the quarter, up 1.7 points year-on-year, primarily due to lower component and logistics costs in Personal Systems and favorable mix, partially offset by currency and competitive pricing across both of our businesses. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.7 billion or 12.6% of revenue. The increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by the Poly acquisition and investments in growth initiatives, partially offset by disciplined cost management, including Future Ready structural cost savings. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.2 billion, down 15.1%. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $143 million, down sequentially due to lower short-term financing activity and up year-on-year primarily due to higher interest expense, driven by an increase in both debt outstanding and interest rates as well as higher factoring expenses. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share decreased $0.17 or 17% to $0.86 with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $93 million, primarily related to restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition and divestiture-related charges and other tax adjustments, offset partially by the debt extinguishment benefit and nonoperating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q3 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.76. Now let's turn to segment performance. In Q3, Personal Systems revenue was $8.9 billion, down 11% or 8% in constant currency. Total units were up 3%. Sequentially, revenue was up 9% and total units were up 21% with Commercial up 17% and Consumer up 28%. Improved sequential demand was driven by seasonal strength with back-to-school demand. We also saw continued commercial enterprise softness driven by cautious spending and delayed purchase decisions. We improved our overall market share in calendar Q2 on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, driven by gains in both Commercial and Consumer markets. We continued to see Commercial representing approximately 70% of our revenue mix for the quarter. Our strategy remains focused on driving profitable share growth. Our channel inventory levels are normalizing. However, our estimate is that the industry-wide channel inventory continues to remain elevated. As a consequence, ASP pressures offset volume growth, accounting for year-over-year revenue decline in Personal Systems in the quarter. Drilling into the details. Consumer revenue was down 12% and Commercial was down 11%. Increased competitive and promotional pricing drove ASPs lower, partially offset by contributions from hybrid systems revenue and higher unit volumes resulting in share gains. We increased our market share in higher-value premium categories, including Commercial Windows and Gaming. Personal Systems delivered almost $600 million of operating profit with operating margins of 6.6%. Our margin declined 0.1 points year-over-year, primarily due to increased pricing competition, mix, currency and higher OpEx due to the Poly acquisition. This was partially offset by lower costs, including commodity costs, structural cost savings and logistics expense. In Print, our results reflect our continued focus on key initiatives as we navigated the challenges of a softer and increasingly competitive print market. In Q3, total Print revenue was $4.3 billion, down 7% nominally or 5% in constant currency. The decline was driven by soft demand in both Consumer and Commercial, market share [Technical Difficulty] currency and lower supplies revenue. Hardware revenue was down $256 million, driven by lower volumes, primarily due to China market softness and aggressive pricing competition as our Japanese competitors have leveraged the weaker yen to their advantage. Total hardware units decreased 19%, driven by softer print demand in both home and commercial. Industrial graphics revenue, particularly hardware, remains pressured by persistent soft enterprise demand with the greatest impact seen in Europe. By customer segment, Commercial revenue decreased 6% or 5% in constant currency with units down 8%. Consumer revenue decreased 28% or down 26% in constant currency with units down 20%. ASPs were down year-over-year, driven by the promotional and competitive pricing and currency, offset partially by a favorable mix in both Consumer and Commercial. Supplies revenue was $2.8 billion, declining 2% nominally and roughly flat at constant currency, in line with expectations. The decline was driven by demand softness, particularly in China, lower usage and a lower installed base. This was offset partially by pricing actions earlier in the year and share gains [internally] (ph). Print operating profit was approximately $800 million, down 12% year-on-year, and operating margin was 18.6%. Operating margin decreased 1.2 points, driven by competitive pricing and unfavorable currency, partially offset by structural cost savings and favorable mix. I would also like to note that we recorded accounting adjustments primarily related to a revenue contract in our Personal Systems segment. This has been reflected in our prior quarter compares which I just covered. It was not material to any of our previously filed financial statements and does not impact our current quarter results. We continue to make strong progress on our Future Ready transformation in Q3, and we expect to deliver at least 40% of our three-year gross annual structural run rate savings target of $1.4 billion for FY '23. As I've mentioned previously, we are working on a range of programs, which should enable us to achieve and potentially exceed key milestones for reducing costs across our business. Given the dynamic in Print, we are building the plan to accelerate cost reductions in that business. Let me update you on our progress in Q3. A key pillar of our transformation plan is focused on simplifying our product portfolio, significantly reducing the number of platforms we support to drive agility and operating leverage. We've made great progress in Personal Systems as the actions we've taken have positively impacted our Q3 operating profit rate performance. Specifically, we continue to make great progress standardizing our Personal Systems platforms. At the end of Q3, we were nearly halfway to our goal of reducing our total number of Personal Systems platforms by approximately one-third by the end of FY '24. In addition, we continue to reduce our commodity complexity, decreasing the number of client SKUs in our Personal Systems portfolio. In addition, we continue to look for new opportunities to reduce our cost structure across the organization. In Q3, for example, we optimized our media spend by consolidating our marketing programs and expanding our in-housing model further. We expect marketing will continue to deliver additional savings in headcount productivity and cost optimization as we unlock new digital solutions. We are aggressively pressing forward with our AI agenda to reinvent various functions inside the company to accelerate both our products and productivity. We are enhancing our software coding practices to accelerate code development to improve speed, efficiencies and quality reviews. We are also leveraging our telemetry data to proactively address customer needs and to provide tailored recommendations and solutions to improve their efficiency and productivity. Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Q3 cash flow from operations was solid at $1 billion, and free cash flow was approximately $900 million. The cash conversion cycle was minus 31 days in the quarter. This improved two days year-over-year, primarily due to days of inventory decreasing one day and days payable increasing four days, partially offset by days receivable increasing three days. The sequential growth in Personal Systems has improved the overall cash conversion cycle as expected. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect operational improvements will help drive a sequential increase in free cash flow, including an increase in Personal Systems revenue and an improvement in working capital. In Q3, we returned approximately $216 million to shareholders via cash dividends. In addition, we successfully completed a debt tender during the quarter, retiring greater than $1 billion of debt. Consistent with our outlook, we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Looking forward to Q4, we expect the challenging economic climate and continued demand softness will remain headwinds for our business near term. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. We still expect operating expenses, excluding Poly, will be down year-over-year for FY '23. We intend to start managing dilution this quarter as we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy over the long term while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. For Personal Systems, the PC market size for the second half of calendar year '23 is smaller versus prior expectations, driven mainly by demand weakness in China. We expect industry CI levels will normalize by the end of Q4, resulting in improving ASPs as the quarter progresses but by less than initially expected and that enterprise demand will be softer. We expect Personal Systems margins in Q4 to be at the higher end of our 5% to 7% long-term range, driven by sequential revenue growth, lower commodity costs and strong structural and operating cost savings. In Print, we expect overall Print revenue will rebound sequentially due to seasonality. We expect supplies revenue in FY '23 to decline by a low single-digit in constant currency with easier year-on-year compares in Q4. We expect Print enterprise demand softness, including industrial, which will remain under pressure due to elongated sales cycles. We expect Print margins to be above the high end of our 16% to 18% target range for Q4, driven by disciplined pricing in a competitive environment and cost management that will help to offset softened demand. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook for Q4 and fiscal year 2023. We are lowering our FY '23 non-GAAP EPS outlook range by $0.11 at the midpoint. The primary factors driving our guidance include our revised outlook for Q4 due to the macro challenges I discussed previously and the effect of the accounting adjustments I referenced earlier, which impacts our H1 '23 non-GAAP EPS by $0.03. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.97 and fourth quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.77. We expect FY '23 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.23 to $3.35, and FY '23 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.95 to $3.07. We expect free cash flow to be approximately $3 billion for FY '23, in line with the low end of our prior guidance range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion. And now I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questioner today will be Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Enrique, you've talked a fair bit about looking to optimize your cost structure. Can you just talk about what sort of cost savings are you expecting from these initiatives? And does that suggest that you expect these revenue headwinds that you're seeing right now persist into fiscal '24 as well? Enrique Lores : Sure. Thank you for the question. So as we have said before, our goal for the next year is to reduce our structural cost by $1.4 billion and to achieve 40% of those in fiscal year '23. And as Marie said in the prepared remarks, we are on track to deliver on those. And you can see the impact of those in the rates of both businesses, Personal Systems and Print, is probably the best way to see the impact of what we are seeing. I think some of the headwinds, on the second part of your question about the headwinds, we think that most of the headwinds are temporary and that is more a delay on some of the progress that we were starting to see from a pricing perspective, for example. But nevertheless, we -- as we always do, we are going to be looking at accelerating some of the savings that we had in the plan to compensate for them on the short term. In terms of our outlook for fiscal year '24, sorry, I will finish, we have our Investor Day about five weeks from now, and this is when we will be sharing our plans for '24 and kind of the overall view that we have for the company. Amit Daryanani : That's perfect. I'll wait for the Analyst Day for that one. And I guess, Marie, when I think about free cash flow generation, $1.3 billion, give or take, for the year so far. As you think about what you need in Q4 to hit the $3 billion number, can you just talk about how much of that do you think is working capital improvement versus net income? Because it does seem like a pretty good step-up in Q4 to achieve that. So just the levers that enable you to get that would be helpful. Thank you. Marie Myers : Sure, no worries. And, good afternoon. So first of all, I'll just start out with sort of unpacking how to think about the free cash flow for Q4. If you take the midpoint of our revised guide, you can see that our net earnings is approximately $3.3 billion. So if you take that $3.3 billion and then you take off the $400 million of expected restructuring charges, that gets you into the $2.9 billion range. And really, the remaining, as you pointed out, Amit, it's really coming from an improvement in CCC. So really, working capital is really one of the key drivers for cash flow in Q4, and that's very much in line with what actually happened in cash flow in Q3. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much for taking my question. As you look at the, I guess, PC and Print business and subscriptions, you've talked about, obviously, subscription ink, you've had a number of different things you're looking at on the Print side. And I know you've talked about it in the future on PCs. I'm just curious, as you're looking at the market, if you're thinking about opportunities going forward, has there been any change in maybe customer buying behavior related to subscriptions? Have you seen any changes in terms of increased churn or maybe lower churn? I'm just wondering how that model is playing through your product line. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Enrique Lores : Hi, Shannon. Thank you. So no big changes in our thinking. As we have shared, this quarter, we continued to see growth in the number of enrollees, also in the revenue that we get from our subscription program. We have also continued the expansion of our paper program. As we shared a quarter ago, we wanted to expand internationally, and this is what we have done. We are now present in several countries in Europe, and the adoption continues to grow. In terms of churn, no big changes in what we have seen during the last quarter. And then our plan continues to be, as you were outlining, to integrate more and more parts of our portfolio. In the coming months, we will start having the first PC and Print subscription, and we will continue the expansion after that. And important to highlight is going to become, over time, a more important part of our business, mostly because it allows us to deliver a better value proposition to our customers. This is really why not only because of the financial but also because of the return and the NPS is a critical part of our strategy going forward. Shannon Cross : Thanks. And then I was wondering, just with Poly, maybe if you could provide more sort of insights into what you've seen since the acquisition. I'm curious if there are opportunities. I know AI gets used ad nauseam these days, but in terms of different ways that we might interact with our computers over time, I'm just wondering how you're seeing that asset, both since you acquired it and then going forward to the extent you'll talk about it before the Analyst Day. Thank you. Enrique Lores : Sure. Thank you. So a couple of comments. First of all, of course, some of the macro trends that we have seen in the industry and some of the Poly competitors have shared those details. The Poly business has been impacted in the short term by a reduction in the term of some of the major markets. At the same time, the reaction from our partners, customers, as I have shared in the past, has been extremely positive. And as you are saying, there is a lot of opportunity to innovate in that space and to deliver a much better value proposition and a much better experience. We all know how painful some of the video conferences are when you have people in the room, people outside. And we just launched a solution using AI, I'm sorry to use the AI term, where with AI, we can manage or produce almost the video conference, the who will be talking frame, the different people in the room, and we are seeing really much better experience for both people in the room and people outside the room. And when we will have both Innovation Day and our Investor Day, you will be able to see some of these solutions and see the value that they bring. Shannon Cross : Thank you. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. You talked about printing and the need to really focus on trying to find incremental cost improvement, and you specifically alluded to that for printing. And I'm wondering if that statement is pointing to the fact that you see something structurally more challenged in printing than you did before? And then I have a follow-up, please. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Good question, Toni. So as we -- what we have seen in printing is that especially on the home side, we have seen a significant decline of units and it's in the range of 20%. And this clearly will put more pressure on the Print business going forward. It's not a short-term impact. It's really more a medium and long-term impact. And even if in many cases, the units we have lost are low-end units which have relatively low value, clearly, there is going to be more pressure there. And this is why we mentioned that we are going to be accelerating some of the cost reduction activities that we had in the plan, especially focused on home, on consumer, which is where we are seeing this pressure and things like acceleration of the simplification of the portfolio, acceleration of the business model transformation, growing more in what we call [bigging and big donor] (ph) are all the different combinations where we are accelerating our plans. And again, we will discuss this more in detail in a few weeks. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. And then if I could just follow up, it sounds like the demand environment is pretty challenging, and the pricing environment is pretty challenging. And yet the margins that you're experiencing in both businesses and that you're guiding for in Q4 are actually above what your longer-term targets are. And so I was wondering if you could reconcile that. And are those targets too low for printing and for PCs? Or what -- why in the face of pricing pressure and volume pressure are you not seeing margins go down into the range? And what are the trigger points for margins going back down into the range on Print and more in the middle of the range on PCs? Marie Myers : Hey, Toni. Good afternoon. It's Marie. So why don't I go ahead and comment on the margin ranges for both business and sort of unpack some of the drivers there. But first of all, I'd start out by saying you are seeing some of the benefits that we've spoken about today and in prior calls of the Future Ready transformation. As we've said in the past, we do expect to see those savings flow through both cost of sales and OpEx. And frankly, I think you're seeing the benefits of that in the rate. But obviously, there are some nuances by business. So I'll just unpack it quickly, so to give you that detail. In terms of Personal Systems, we are expecting to see quarter-on-quarter, sequentially, some gradual improvement in pricing as we start to see some of that normalization of CI. So there is a factor of that in the rate as well, combined with the impact of lower commodity costs and then both structural and operating costs that we spoke about earlier. And obviously, that's offset by some of the enterprise softness. With respect to Print, it is a combination of both strategy and execution. We've got the portfolio rebalancing. I think we talked a little bit about that earlier with Shannon, plus honestly, pricing discipline and then the cost management from our transformation. So it's all those factors combined, but you can see there that certainly, cost is a key element. And then I think from a -- in terms of the long term, we're still very confident that for Print, the 16% to 18% is the right long-term rate, and that's because there are a number of different forcing functions there, particularly as you look at the guidance that we've given about supplies in terms of the revenue decline there, the low to mid-single digit and plus a much more competitive sort of pricing in that we've seen in Consumer, and some of that is even evidenced in enterprise more recently. But I think we're overall confident that the rates are the right rates and the right ranges for us for both Personal Systems and Print. And I'll turn it to Enrique if he has anything else to add. Enrique Lores : Not much to add, Marie. You covered it well. Maybe the last comment is, as we have mentioned before, we don't manage the businesses for the rates. We manage them for operating profit dollars. And this is really what we care the most. We provide ranges because we know it's important for all of you to be able to model, but our goal is to grow operating profit dollars for the company. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess if I can start off with a question more in relation to the moderation of the sequential improvement into 4Q that you're outlining because of the macro. And maybe if you can flesh out how to think about how much of that impact is volume- or unit-driven versus a more promotional environment in the segments than you anticipated at this time. Just trying to get a sense of how much of this relates to sub-seasonal PC volume growth versus maybe just a more promotional environment than you were anticipating. And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you. Enrique Lores : Yeah, perfect. Thank you. And really, thank you for the question because this was one of the most important things we wanted to clarify in the call. Let me start by saying that the biggest driver of the change of guide we have made is that we are not expecting PC prices to recover sequentially as much as we were expecting one quarter ago. And this is really driven by what do we think is the channel situation at the market level. Because even if we have mostly normalized our channel inventories, our estimate is that the industry continues to have significant channel inventory. And therefore, we will continue -- we need to continue to expect aggressive prices, aggressive promotions through Q4. And this is really what is the major driver behind that. There are other changes that maybe Marie, you want to explain as well? Marie Myers : Yes, absolutely. So why don't I just give a little bit more context in terms of what Enrique commented on, Samik. I think if you think about the Q4 guide, obviously, the macro is in there and we've talked about that, I think, in our prepared remarks around those headwinds that we've seen, including the sluggish recovery in China. But in addition, just in terms of Personal Systems, it's really -- the way to think about it is the market size and the opportunity. And it's driven by sort of both ASP pressure that we talked about in terms of that CI and then also the softer demand that we've seen in the enterprise. And then finally, there's also some pressure on the Print business just in terms of the enterprise softness, and that's really in industrial where we're seeing today just elongated sales cycles due to that pressure. Enrique Lores : So let me maybe add two final things. First of all is even if our expectation is that most of these changes are really temporary, we are not standing still, and this is why we mentioned that we are going to be accelerating some of the Future Ready cost reductions to compensate for this. And then to close, I think it's also important to remember that despite of this change, we expect the performance of the company to improve once more sequentially Q4 to Q3, like we have done Q3 to Q2 and as we did Q2 to Q1. I think that's important to have in mind. Samik Chatterjee : Good. And for my follow-up, if I can just ask, the India market, they have instituted a ban, I think, or proposed a ban since from October 31 on PC imports. How are you thinking about sort of the implementation of that or what are you assuming in your guide relative to that impact? I know it's not a big market overall, but just in terms of what you're assuming and what are you seeing in terms of how to navigate that situation? Thank you. Enrique Lores : Yes. So we don't think there is going to be much impact of a potential ban in India in the short term. And in the long term, we had already been working for a while to increase our manufacturing capacity in India. You know in parallel to the ban, they launched also the local production plant, the PLI 2.0 plan. We have applied to participate on that, and we are working with them to ramp our manufacturing capacity there. India is not a huge market but is a very important market for us, where we see a lot of long-term potential, and this is why we are reacting to that. And in fact, maybe just to close, only this week, we announced with Jio the launch of the first cloud PC that we have been working with them for a while, which we think is going to -- is a new category of PCs that are going to help us to really accelerate our growth in that country. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Erik Woodring : Great. Thank you for taking my questions this afternoon. Enrique, maybe can you dig into some of the PC channel inventory comments a bit more? Meaning how should we think about the specific regions where channel inventories might be more elevated than others? Are there any regions where channel inventories have normalized? Maybe how to think about that with traditional PCs versus Chromebooks, if there is any difference. And then ultimately, how that does impact your view on the 2023 PC TAM? I think last quarter, you talked about 250 million to 260 million units. How are you guys thinking about it today? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Enrique Lores : Sure. Lots of questions in the question. I'll try to cover everything. Now in terms of channel inventory, we are really pleased with the progress we have made normalizing our inventory. We are almost there, and I say almost because the area where we still have channel inventory is actually what you mentioned about Chromebooks. As you know, Google is going to be increasing the royalty prices in the coming weeks. And therefore, we saw at the very end of the quarter some increased orders and pull-up demand of customers and partners that wanted to take advantage of lower prices. So we ship those, and this is the area where we still have some high inventory. But for the rest, we are now in a good position. In terms of TAM, we have reduced slightly the TAM for fiscal year \u201924 -- for 2023. Most of the reduction is coming from the new TAM in China that is really as the market has not grown as much as we were expecting, this has created some impact on the overall TAM. And then we have seen also a slight change between the mix of Consumer and Commercial where Consumer has been performing better and especially because of more sluggish demand on the enterprise side, we have seen the Commercial projection reducing. Thank you. Erik Woodring : Super. That's helpful. Thank you very much, Enrique. And then maybe just a follow-up, I wanted to get back to some of your comments on PC pricing. Maybe can you just talk about, again, some of those underlying factors in terms of relative to the July quarter, how we should think about the intensity of promotions, mix shift. And ultimately, I interpreted from your comments, we should be thinking about PC ASP growth sequentially just at a lower rate. I just want to make sure that's the takeaway we should be taking away from your comments. Thanks so much. Enrique Lores : So let me start there. So yes, our current assumption is that price -- ASP for PCs will grow Q3 to Q4, but the growth will be more moderate than we were expecting a quarter ago. And again, the major driver of this is the fact that at the market level, we continue to see -- or our estimate is that channel inventory is higher than what it should be. And therefore, we are going to continue to see pressure from a promotional perspective. There is also an element of mix. Hence, I also mentioned that Consumer in Q3 and we expect in Q4 perform better than expected, and we -- the reverse happen on the Commercial side. And as you know, usually, ASPs for Commercial are better than ASPs for Consumer. Now what I think is important to highlight is our PC business grew from Q3 to Q2. We expect it to grow also from Q4 to Q3. So the recovery of the business is happening. Erik Woodring : Super. Thanks so much for the extra color. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sidney Ho : Thank you. I want to ask about the full year EPS guidance. The midpoint is coming down by $0.11, and I assume most of that is coming out of fiscal Q4. Based on your answer to a previous question, is it fair to assume most of that is coming from lower revenue? How big of an impact is lower margin also a factor? And then, are there other offsets that we should be thinking about? Enrique Lores : Let me start talking about Q4 and then Marie will talk about the full year. So in Q4, as I said before, the majority of the impact comes from the change in the expectation that we have in PC pricing. We expect it to improve Q3 to Q4 but less than we were expecting before. And this has a significant impact on margin. There are other smaller factors like the size of the market in China, the enterprise performance where we have seen a slowdown of orders driven by industrial print. That also is a segment where we have seen an impact, but the majority of it comes from the price -- the change in price assumptions for PCs. And then Marie, for the full year? Marie Myers : Yes. So why don't I just walk you through the full year here, Sidney? So basically, as Enrique said, it's -- Q4 is $0.08 and then we had a $0.03 adjustment for an accounting correction in the first half. So really just in terms of just the drivers, I think the right way to unpack it is it's really the PC market size for the second half of calendar '23 that's smaller than expected and the industry CI comments that Enrique talked about. But I think the key is we're going to see those improving ASPs as the quarter progresses but it's less than we initially expected. So if you look at that plus the enterprise demand in PS and Print, that's really what are the drivers of the $0.08 in Q4. Sidney Ho : Okay, that's helpful. Maybe as a follow-up, last quarter, you guys talked about commodities pricing being a tailwind for you in fiscal Q3, which seems to be the case. But fiscal Q4 could be different. Can you give us an update there? How long do you think those strategic buys that you have done be able to shield you from commodity price increases? Any way you can quantify that, that would be helpful. Thanks. Marie Myers : Sure. So to give you some context there, Sidney, as you rightly said, we have seen the benefit of commodity costs in Q3 across both businesses, frankly, both Personal Systems and Print. There are some unique ICs in Print that are still somewhat in an inflationary state. But overall, the costs have been favorable for commodities in both businesses. We do expect that, that will carry forward into Q4. So there will be additional commodity cost declines in Q4 sequentially. And in terms of how we're thinking about strategic buys, I would say -- I think I've said this in prior calls, we do feel it's really important to be operationally excellent. But frankly, we're going to take advantage of opportunities that make financial sense. So if there are strategic buys that make -- that fit that profile and that character, we'll absolutely take advantage of them. But I think the overall environment is we're seeing those positive trends. But I'd just add that the favorable trends in CPUs, we're starting to expect to see those to flatten out. Sidney Ho : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. Your line is open. David Vogt : Great. Thank you guys for taking my question. Can I just go back to the margin dynamic, Marie, given all of the moving pieces, particularly around lower, obviously, PC sales, smaller TAM, and sort of the mix, I guess, away from Chromebooks in the fiscal fourth quarter? I guess I'm still going back to Toni's question. I'm still trying to struggle with how, kind of walk through again all the different moving factors on why PSG margins are going to be towards the high end, given a smaller sort of unit base with, obviously, pricing pressure that's leading to maybe a slower uptick in price in the fourth quarter than you had originally expected. And then I have a follow-up. Marie Myers : So why don't I walk you through Q3 first, what happened, and then through Q4, because I think that paints the context on how to think about Q4? So if you look at the Q3 rate, which was 6.6%, it was really a cost story. Whether we talked about just the way we manage costs, the results of sort of the structural costs that we've driven through the Future Ready program. And then I just spoke about with Sidney about the commodity costs. So we saw that cost benefit clearly in Personal Systems in Q3. Much of that is frankly going to be a rinse and repeat into Q4. And there's just a couple of additional sort of drivers in there that help to sort of buffer the rate into the higher end of the range. And that is I think what Enrique clearly articulated was that gradual improvement in pricing that we expect to happen Q3, Q4, and that's really due to the stabilization of the CI level. So that's sort of like an additional factor over and above what we had in Q3. And that's really sort of, I think, the best way to think about the rates, particularly in Personal Systems as you think about Q4. And then obviously, we still got -- underpinning all of that is the enterprise softness that continues to be out there in the market as well. But that's really what's driving it. I hope that provides you some more context. David Vogt : Okay, okay, thank you. And then on capital allocation, I know you took down some debt in the third quarter. And I think if I heard you correctly, and I jumped on late, I apologize, but it sounds like you're going to restart the buyback in the fourth quarter. I guess from a cadence perspective, does that suggest that you think you'll be under the gross leverage target in fiscal '24 that you have sort of laid out there, that two turns of gross leverage, given the cost initiatives that you talked about in the prior remarks, and we should expect sort of a more consistent capital return going forward? Or could we see another situation where maybe there's a bit of a pause if we hit that gross leverage target or maybe still above it for a little bit? Marie Myers : Well, I'll just say that sort of our strategy remains the same. We intend to manage our leverage under 2. And I'd say we should also look at it over the longer term and not just sort of quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, we're pleased with where we landed Q3 and we're slightly under two times debt to EBITDA. And in terms of then how to think about leverage and share repurchasing, just -- you might have missed the call so let me just clarify. We said in the call that we expect to start to buy back shares to start to manage dilution in Q4. And I think that comment is really important because I'm not sure if you caught the comments on the call, but that's just sort of how we're thinking about it. And obviously, key to us is the commitment we've made around returning 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders. So I'll turn it over to Enrique to probably, I know he's got some thoughts around this as well. Enrique Lores : Yes. I think two comments. First is our strategy remains the same, so no change, and I think that's important for investors to know. At the same time, the way you asked the question, I think, is the right way to ask it. We are not managing our leverage ratio for one quarter. We need to manage it for the long term. And therefore, we think it's important to restart in a prudent way. We are going to restart by compensating quarterly dilution and this is how we are going to start. And we will solidify our plans for '24 and beyond once we -- and we have conviction that we will be able to maintain the leverage ratio below 2 times, we will accelerate our plans. But we're going to restart prudently, which we think, given the environment where we are, is the right thing to do. David Vogt : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for clarification. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Your line is open. Asiya Merchant : Great. Thank you for the opportunity. If you could just unpack a little bit of what's going on, on the supply side. Given that the Print hardware unit, I think even on the inkjet side, on the consumer side are guided down, what gives you some confidence that supplies revenue is, I guess, unchanged here, I think down low digits in constant currency terms? Thank you. Marie Myers : Yeah, I'm happy to. Hi, Asiya. So in terms of supplies, we still do expect to be in the range of low to mid for FY '23. And there's really two primary drivers. One is the usage trends and the second is the share trends. And I would say usage is very much, it's declining in line with what we expected. But what we've seen is that pricing remains resilient. And another important factor is the fact that our inventory in the multi-tiered ecosystem remains in a healthy shape. And just one thing to think about when you do the comps, don't look for the sort of year-on-year because last quarter, we had a relatively easy compare because we had a tough Q4 in '22. So look over the long term, I think that's the right way to think about supplies. I don't know, Enrique, if you've got anything else to add. Enrique Lores : Maybe add one. One additional comment. I think if we think about supplies, there are multiple drivers of supplies performance. Once clearly the number of units that is being installed, which as I told, I think it was Toni before, this is going to create some pressure as well as we are saying. On the other side, we also have the levels of price, which is something that has been working for us during the last year and especially share. And as we have said before, we have been growing our share of supply during the last quarter. It continued to happen this quarter and this is also a part of our strategy going forward. Asiya Merchant : Great. And then just on the Japanese competitors, anything -- I think there was some comments made on taking advantage of the yen, I misheard that. But if you could just kind of talk to us about the competitive dynamics in Print and how you guys are kind of thinking about that over the next couple of quarters. Enrique Lores : Yes. So we have clearly seen an increase of aggressive pricing from some of our Japanese competitors. Of course, if you look at the currency rate between dollar and yen is at one of the lower level it has been in a long time, and this clearly gives them an advantage. Our strategy has not changed. We think we need to continue to sell positive NPV units, units that will not create unprofitable customers. And this is why in some areas of the segments like in the low end, where really are not very attractive around profitable units, we are losing share because this is not a business that we're going to go after. And based on what we see, we don't think this is going to be changing anytime soon. And this is why we also mentioned that we are going to be accelerating our cost actions in Print, both to be more competitive in the short term but especially also to be able to maintain our profitability going forward. Thank you. Asiya Merchant : Thank you. Enrique Lores : And I think this was the last question, so let me use this opportunity to close. First of all, I think we delivered a solid quarter in Q3 in a clearly tough environment where we continued to improve our sequential performance while also continuing to invest in the future. And we -- this is really at the core of our Future Ready plan that is enabling to do both, savings that we can use to continue to invest and also to respond to short-term challenges. And then to close, I'm really looking forward to see all of you in person or most of you in person on October 10 here in Palo Alto, where we will be talking about our plan for '24, innovation and long-term plans. So thank you for joining the call and looking forward to see all of you in a few weeks from now. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Enrique Lores : Thank you, Orit, and thank you, everyone, for joining our final earnings call of 2023. It was great to host many of you for our Securities Analyst Meeting last month. As I said at the time, we have made significant progress against our strategic priorities. And we see attractive opportunities ahead. Our Future Ready plan, combined with our relentless focus on the things we can control, enable us to make steady progress against our plan in fiscal year '23. We are very pleased with our Q4 results, and we have finished the year in a much stronger position than we began. We knew from the start that it could be a tough year. The challenging external environment constrained demand across the industry, and this is reflected in our full-year results. Net revenue was $53.7 billion, down 15% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating profit was $4.6 billion, down 14%. We executed well in the face of these market dynamics, growing non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP EPS sequentially throughout the year. And our second-half results were significantly stronger than the first. We also made good progress in our key growth areas, which grew mid-single digits and drove approximately 20% of our total company revenue for the year. Our plan is designed to grow these businesses to at least $15 billion in revenue by the end of fiscal year '26. And we over-delivered on our gross annualized structural cost savings plan, putting us well on-track to achieve our recently increased three-year target of $1.6 billion. Our results reinforce our confidence in the financial outlook we shared with you in October. And I want to say a big thank you to our entire HP team for paving the way toward our next phase of growth. I'm going to use my time today to summarize our Q4 performance, provide insight into each of our segments and reiterate some of the thoughts I shared last month about the market in 2024. Let me start with Q4. Net revenue was $13.8 billion, that was down 6% year-over-year due to the expected market dynamics we discussed last quarter. Revenue grew 5% sequentially, reflecting our progress. I want to mention our key growth areas. Collectively, they grew 10% sequentially or 2 times faster than our total company growth. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.90, up 5% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. And free cash flow was strong at $1.9 billion, enabling us to meet our full-year target of approximately $3 billion. I'm particularly pleased with the strength of our innovation. It was on display at our HP Imagine event last month, where we gathered media and industry analysts from around the world to showcase more than 20 new products and services. This included the Spectre Fold, a device that reflects HP's culture of innovation at its best. Seamlessly transforming from laptop to tablet to desktop, it has widespread recognition as one of the most innovative form factors the industry has seen. And it recently received by Red Dot Design Award, one of the highest honors in industrial design. We also continue to build momentum in AI. We are the first company to offer dedicated workstation solutions with NVIDIA's AI Enterprise software. And more broadly, we're advancing our work to create the AI PC category. We have built the widest range of client product based on Intel's next-generation of processors, Intel Core Ultra. Giving us a strong foundation on which to build, but we co-engineer and commercialize new AI architectures next year. And I am very encouraged by the work underway with all of our silicon and software partners. The emergence of the AI PC in 2024 will start a new cycle of market expansion and refresh. As I shared last month, we believe this can double the overall PC category growth rate over the next three years. In Print, we have refreshed our entire A3 and A4 portfolio, making devices smaller, more modular and easier to manage and secure. We also continue to leverage our IP to create new categories. This includes our SitePrint construction solution, which has already laid out more than 1 million square feet at construction site in North America and the U.K., and is launching in new geographies. We expanded our Poly solutions for large conference rooms and small hidden spaces. We also launched a new conference room as-a-service subscription to help customers optimize usage and create better employee experiences. And we launched HP Workforce Central, which integrates data for more than 60 service tools across PCs, printers and Poly devices into a single platform. These will drive simplicity, productivity and security for IT departments. We're in beta with over 2,000 customers and we'll be rolling it out to all managed solution accounts. As we innovate across our portfolio, we remain equally focused on our sustainable impact priorities. A great example is our recently announced HP Renew solutions. By enhancing our refurbishing capabilities, we are now able to extend the life of devices and drive peculiarity upscale. In addition to supporting our sustainability goals, this reduces total cost of ownership and create an accretive business. We have launched in India and we'll be expanding into other markets during fiscal year '24. We're also playing an active role to support our communities. Right now, we are particularly focused on the needs of those suffering in Israel and Gaza. Since the attacks of October 7, our number one priority has been the safety and well-being of our employees in the region. I want to take a moment to recognize the incredible work our team is doing to keep our business in Israel fully operational in the face to an extremely difficult situation. HP Foundation has committed $1 million to humanitarian relief partners in the region. We will continue doing everything we can to support our local teams. Let me now turn to our business unit performance. The external environment remains consistent with what we discussed at our Securities Analyst Meeting. Our baseline scenario of market stabilization across fiscal year '24 has not changed. And our markets largely behave as we expected in Q4. Consumer showed a more typical seasonal uptick. Commercial customers remain cautious, but we saw some signs of stabilization especially in Personal Systems. And we continue to see demand weakness in China due to challenging economic conditions. Personal Systems net revenue was $9.4 billion in the quarter, that's down 8% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. But what's most important is we continue to drive significant sequential improvement in the business, with PS revenue up 5% quarter-over-quarter. Our disciplined execution delivered strong PS operating margin of 6.7%. We once again gained share in Commercial and Consumer year-over-year. We saw a continued recovery in Consumer and Gaming, both of which grew double-digits sequentially. And through our stepped-up focus on Workforce Solutions, we grew our PS Service TCV double-digits, including new wins with several large global customers spanning multiple industries. Hybrid systems grew sequentially, largely driven by seasonality in consumer peripherals. This market is currently impacted by enterprise spending, but we remain bullish on the long-term growth opportunity and the breadth of our offering across hardware peripherals and services is a huge advantage. Turning to Print. Net revenue was $4.4 billion, that's down 3% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency. Print revenue grew 4% sequentially, while units were flat. Supplies revenue was up in constant currency in Q4 on an easier compare and finished the year down 1% in constant currency, in-line with our long-term outlook. We drove strong Print operating margins of 18.9%, reflecting disciplined execution and cost management. HP+ enabled and big tank printers, once again comprise approximately 60% of our shipments. Instant Ink delivered another quarter of revenue and subscriber growth year-over-year, and we drove strong momentum in Workforce Solutions with double-digit TCV growth and significant new MPS wins. We remain focused on regaining profitable Print share and improving our performance in office, and we are starting to see the impact of our efforts, with solid share recovery in Americas, parts of Europe and China quarter-over-quarter, as well as strong share gains in A3. Our industrial graphics business returned to growth year-over-year and was up double digits sequentially, including continued recovery in labels and packaging. And while 3D is impacted by the current environment, we continue to build momentum in the market. At Formnext earlier this month, we showcased our work with partners and customers like BMW, Decathlon and Siemens, to scale our 3D solution. Overall, Q4 was a solid quarter. We are showing the resilience, agility and operational rigor, needed to win in the market, while advancing our long-term growth priorities. And we feel good about the outlook we shared with you in October. We also remain committed to returning at least 100% of free cash flow, over time, unless opportunities with a higher return on investment arise, and as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x EBITDA. We expect to resume share repurchases in Q1. Let me close by reiterating something I said at our Securities Analyst Meeting. HP is a compelling investment. We have market-leading portfolios in the PC and print categories, and we are well positioned to drive profitable growth in our core markets going forward. We have significant opportunities to accelerate in our key growth areas. We have world-class operational capabilities to deliver on our targets and reduce our structural costs. And we have a shareholder-friendly capital return strategy. These are core strengths of HP. Our Q4 and fiscal year '23 results reflect the consistent progress we are making. And we are confident in our plan to deliver sustained revenue, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow growth. Let me now turn the call over to Marie for a deeper dive into the numbers. Marie Myers : Thanks, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you all today. We delivered another strong quarter financially, due to outstanding operational execution and good progress in our Future Ready transformation. We generated solid results across revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow, building on our proven track record of meeting or exceeding our goals. Our team is executing well despite the challenging macro environment, delivering Q4 sequential growth in revenue and non-GAAP operating profit dollars in both Personal Systems and Print. Margins were at or above the high-end of our ranges, resulting in a return to year-over-year growth in non-GAAP EPS, while free cash flow more than doubled sequentially, consistent with our outlook. We exceeded our Future Ready transformation cost savings target for fiscal '23 and are on track in '24 to continue reducing our structural costs while investing in our key growth areas. While we continue to monitor economic indicators and geopolitical risks, we're pleased with the momentum and health of our business. We will continue our efforts to drive fundamental improvements to our cost structure longer term, while prudently and aggressively managing near-term expenses. With the savings we generate, we'll continue to focus on prioritizing our investments, so that we are well positioned to deliver on the longer-term financial outlook, we outlined at our Securities Analyst Meeting last month. Now, let me begin by providing some additional color on our results. Starting with the full year, we stayed focused on what we could control, disciplined execution and cost management, and we delivered solid performance despite the macroeconomic and competitive dynamics we faced. Revenue was $53.7 billion, down 15% nominally and down 12% in constant currency. Revenue in our key growth areas grew mid-single digits, constituting approximately 20% of total revenue. Non-GAAP operating profit was $4.6 billion, down 14% or 8.5% of total revenue, flat year-over-year. Non-GAAP net earnings per share was down 18% to $3.28. We generated $3.1 billion of free cash flow, consistent with our full-year guidance. And we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders and raised our dividend by 5%. Now, let's take a closer look at the details of Q4. Net revenue was $13.8 billion in the quarter, down 6% nominally and 5% in constant currency. Year-over-year declines improved sequentially across each of our regions in constant currency : Americas declined 6%; EMEA declined 2%; and APJ declined 8%, as demand remained soft in China. Gross margin was 21.6% in the quarter, up 3.4 points year-on-year, primarily due to lower component and logistics costs and a favorable mix, partially offset by currency and competitive pricing in Personal Systems. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.7 billion. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by reinvestment of some Future Ready savings in growth initiatives, investment in people and one extra month of Poly, offset in part by structural and other cost reductions. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.2 billion, up 11.5%. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $173 million, up sequentially due largely to higher currency losses and up year-on-year due to higher currency losses and factoring costs. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.08 or 10% to $0.90, with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net benefit totaling $72 million, primarily related to tax adjustment related credits and pension and post-retirement benefit, partially offset by restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition and divestiture-related charges. As a result, Q4 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.97. Now, let's turn to segment performance. In Q4, Personal Systems revenue was $9.4 billion, down 8% or 7% in constant currency, but up 5% sequentially, reflecting seasonal strength ahead of the holiday season. Total units were flat on a net basis with Commercial down 6% and Consumer up 9%. Nevertheless, we improved our overall market share in calendar Q3 on a year-over-year basis for the third consecutive quarter. And year-over-year Commercial revenue declines stabilized sequentially even as Commercial customers remain cautious. Drilling into the details, Consumer revenue was down 1% and Commercial was down 11%, driven by lower TAM, increased competitive pricing and unfavorable mix, offset in part by market share gains in both Consumer and Commercial. Strong profit and margin results in both customer segments were driven by our emphasis on profitable growth and effective cost management. Competitive pricing pressures eased somewhat in Q4, resulting in increased ASPs, contributing to the sequential improvement in Personal Systems revenue this quarter, consistent with our outlook. Our channel inventory is back to normalized levels. Personal Systems delivered $631 million of operating profit with operating margins of 6.7%. Our margin increased 2.5 points year-over-year, primarily due to lower commodity and logistics costs and structural cost savings. This was partially offset by mix, currency and investment in people. Sequentially, our operating margin held firm towards the high-end of our target range, driven by strong profitability in both our Consumer and Commercial business segments. In Print, our results reflect our continued focus on execution and disciplined cost management, as we navigate a weak and competitive print market. In Q4, total Print revenue was $4.4 billion, down 3% nominally or 2% in constant currency. The decline was driven by soft demand in both Consumer and Commercial, market share loss and currency, offset partially by supplies revenue growth. Hardware revenue was down $188 million, driven by lower volumes, attributable largely to continued soft demand in Greater Asia and China and share loss as our Japanese competitors continued to price aggressively. Total hardware units decreased 19% year-over-year. Industrial graphics finished the year positively with revenue returned to growth in Q4, driven by hardware and services with performance improvements across all major geographical regions. By customer segment, Commercial revenue decreased 4% on a reported basis and in constant currency with units down 24%. Consumer revenue decreased 21% or down 19% in constant currency with units down 18%. Demand for traditional home ink printers remain soft but was offset partially by increased demand for big tank printers. In office hardware, ASPs were up double-digit year-over-year as favorable mix, offset competitive pricing and currency headwinds driven by improved contractual A3 demand across multiple markets. Supplies revenue was $2.8 billion, increasing 3% nominally and 4% in constant currency. For FY '23, supplies revenue declined 1% on a constant currency basis, in-line with our long-term outlook of down low- to mid-single digits. Print operating profit was approximately $836 million, down 6% year-over-year, and operating margin was 18.9%, Operating margin decreased 0.8 points, driven by investments in people, competitive pricing and unfavorable currency, partially offset by favorable mix and cost reductions. Turning to our Future Ready transformation plan. We successfully completed the first year of our three-year program and delivered better-than-expected performance against our goals for fiscal year '23. Given the strong progress we made during the year and confidence we have to drive additional structural cost savings, we recently raised our cumulative program target to $1.6 billion. In FY '23, we generated gross annual run rate structural cost savings across COGS and OpEx, exceeding our revised target. Let me briefly recap some key accomplishments across each of the three core pillars of our program that we achieved during fiscal '23. Under our operational excellence pillar, we continue to optimize and reduce structural costs across our businesses, particularly in corporate. We embraced hybrid work, enabling us to rationalize our real estate portfolio, executing 13 site consolidations or exits during the year. We also simplified our go-to-market organization, including streamlining our management structure. We made solid progress on our digital transformation efforts by driving additional automation and process improvements. We modernized our data infrastructure to leverage AI machine learning to deliver richer, data-driven insights from business decisions. Looking ahead, we are accelerating our generative AI capabilities, including rolling out AI tools like GitHub Copilot to approximately half of our developers as well as implementing HP-specific large language models to improve efficiencies through a chatbot for our sales and service representatives. Further, there are significant opportunities ahead, across many additional use cases. Our third pillar is focused on simplifying our product portfolio, significantly reducing the number of platforms we support to drive agility and operating leverage. In FY '23, the actions we took in Personal Systems continued to impact our overall performance. At the end of FY '23, we were approximately halfway to our year-end FY '24 goal of reducing our total number of Personal Systems platforms by approximately one-third. In addition, we made great progress reducing our commodity complexity by decreasing the number of client SKUs at our Personal Systems portfolio. We expect these initiatives will optimize our overall supplier ecosystem, increase our supply chain efficiency and drive better forecast capabilities. And in Print, by rationalizing our investments, we plan to simplify our Print portfolio to drive a 40% reduction in ink hardware platforms shipped by FY '25. As we discussed at our Securities Analyst Meeting, we see significant opportunities ahead of us to focus on our Future Ready plan and position the company to optimize our cost structure and enhance our margin performance. Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Q4 cash flow from operations was strong at $2 billion, and free cash flow was $1.9 billion, on the strength of the sequential growth in Personal Systems. Free cash flow for fiscal year '23 was approximately $3.1 billion, consistent with our outlook. The cash conversion cycle was minus 32 days in the quarter. This improved three days year-over-year, driven exclusively by an increase in days payable. In Q4, we returned approximately $260 million to shareholders via cash dividends. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter, given that we were in possession of material non-public information, but we expect to resume repurchases in Q1 and be active throughout FY '24. For fiscal year '23, we returned greater than $1.1 billion to shareholders and retired $1.6 billion of debt. Regarding FY '24, we are reiterating our outlook provided at our Securities Analyst Meeting last month. We intend to return approximately 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders next year, as long as our debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains under 2x and unless higher ROI opportunities arise, such as strategic acquisitions. Looking forward to FY '24, consistent with what we said at our October Securities Analyst Meeting, we assume the market will stabilize in our base case scenario, underlying that outlook for Personal Systems is for revenues to grow in-line with the personal systems market and for Print revenue to be in line with the print market. We expect operating margins for both Personal Systems and Print to be solidly within their respective target ranges, as we continue to manage costs and pricing in this dynamic and uncertain environment. Regarding our non-GAAP FY '24 EPS outlook, consistent with historical seasonality, we expect second-half performance will be greater than the first half. As we said at our Security Analyst Meeting, we expect corporate other expense for fiscal '24 to be relatively flat year-over-year at approximately $1 billion. Keep in mind that due to the timing of stock compensation expense, we expect approximately one-third of FY '24's corporate other expense in Q1. And in Q1, we expect the economic and demand environment to remain challenging but stable. As we continue to manage cost aggressively to help offset some of these pressures, we expect our operating profit margins for both Personal System and Print to be toward the high end of their respective target ranges for the quarter. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook for Q1 and fiscal year 2024. We expect first quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.86, and first quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70. We expect FY '24 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.65, and FY '24, GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.68 to $3.08. In summary, we are pleased with our Q4 results, as we delivered on our commitments, even in light of the continued challenging macro environment. Our longer-term financial framework that we outlined at our Securities Analyst Meeting last month, remains unchanged, and we have good momentum to execute on our near-term FY '24 objectives. Our focus remains on profitable growth in the higher value segments of the market and structural cost savings across our P&L, while returning 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. And now, I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today is Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you so much. I was wondering maybe you could help us think through the seasonality. Obviously, it's been -- for the first half versus second half, what's implied in your guidance? If we go back a few years, the low 50% of EPS was recognized in the second half versus first half. So, I'm wondering if you could maybe either characterize it that way or second half versus first half on a growth basis on earnings. And maybe within that context you can just give us some sense the commercial PC market continues to be quite weak. I know, Marie, you said that the guidance for fiscal '24 bakes an in-line with market performance. But can you be somewhat explicit about what that performance is in commercial PCs in your fiscal year guide? Thank you so much. Enrique Lores : Yeah. So, Wamsi, hi, this is Enrique. Let me provide a view on macro, and then Marie will be more specific about seasonality on EPS, because I think it will help to understand it better. So, from a macro perspective, what we saw in Q4 is an increase in seasonality, especially for PCs, between Q3 and Q4. And also, on the commercial side, we saw stability of sales. Market continued to remain soft, but especially when we look at real end user demand, we saw demand being stable. And somehow this helps us in the projection that we have for next year. As we discussed before, we expect the PC market to be slightly growing from 2024 to 2023, and the print market to be about flat to slightly decline between '24 and '25 -- '24 and '23, and we expect both segments to improve gradually through the year. So, having said that context, Marie will address the EPS question. Marie Myers : Yeah, no, good afternoon. So, let me walk you through how to think about seasonality. If you take the midpoint of that guide, which is what we gave at SAM, which is the $3.45, if you take the midpoint, basically you can assume the macro is stabilizing. And also, we expect the revenue to improve over the course of the year. So, I would just say we're not back yet quite to normal seasonal patterns, but we're definitely expecting the back half to improve over the first half. So, think about a gradual recovery over the year. But I'll just add, as we think about the Q1 guide, particularly for Personal Systems, I would say at this point, we don't expect that normal seasonality yet due to the pace of the market recovery. So, we're going to see that quarter-on-quarter differential relative to the Q4 period that we've just come out of. So, same guide unchanged, but definitely still not quite back to normal seasonality yet throughout the year. Wamsi Mohan : Thanks, Enrique. Thanks, Marie. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Marie Myers : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryani from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Amit Daryani : Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess my question is just on the Print side. Enrique, I'm hoping you could just touch on what do you seeing from a competitive perspective, given a lot of your peers are in Japan, who are probably leveraging the weaker currency, I think, on the pricing side. I'd love to understand how you're reacting to that. And then really how do you maintain the operating margin of this run rate, given the pricing headwinds -- or competitive headwinds that you have? Maybe you can just touch up on that. And then, Marie, could you just maybe flush out free cash flow? If there are any seasonality we should be cognizant about in Q1 versus rest of the year, that would be helpful. Thank you. Enrique Lores : So, let me start on Print. So, not much has changed since we met a few weeks ago. So, we continue to see a competitive environment on the Print side, especially driven by the current situation between yen and dollar. But I have to say, between Q3 and Q4, we didn't see more aggressive pricing. If anything, prices sequentially improved Q3 to Q4. We have not seen an increase in competition from that perspective. When we look at '24 and the actions that we are taking to compensate for a potential more pricing increase, we are going to be executing the plan that we described before. We have an aggressive cost reduction plan that will help us to manage that. We continue to drive the shift toward HP+ units and profit upfront units that will also help from that perspective. And we continue to drive -- and we expect to grow share in the office space, which will be a contributor of margin improvement. And finally, as we shared in our prepared remarks, we have seen an improvement of the performance of the industrial business. We have seen a recovery of the market. And within the market, we have grown both hardware and consumption. And we think this is going to help us also in 2024. Marie Myers : Yeah, and just a couple of points on the Print rate. So, as we guided in SAM, we're still very confident in the outlook we gave around the revised range on Print. And as a result of that, we do expect in Q1 to still be at the high-end of that range, and then in '24, we expect to be solidly in the range. So, just keep that in mind as you're working through your model. And then, with respect to cash flow and the comments on seasonalities, we're reiterating our guide that we had at SAM of $3.10 to $3.60. And I just add from a seasonality perspective, just always bear in mind that Q1, we do expect cash flow to be lower, and that's due to the fact that we always accrue for our bonus in the prior period, and we typically pay that out in Q1 of the current year. So, expect that Q1 free cash flow will therefore be somewhat lower. But, similarly, as I said in SAM, we expect it to be in-line with net earnings and continue to see those fluctuations around working capital throughout the remaining quarters. Amit Daryani : Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar : Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Enrique, I had a question on the PC side. You said you're expecting modest growth next year. I'm kind of curious, is there a way to quantify it? And how much is AI driving it? And also, when it comes to AI PC, how much kind of an uplift in ASP do you expect versus regular PC? Thank you. Enrique Lores : So, let me start by saying that we are really excited about the impact that AI PCs are going to have in the overall PC category. As we have shared before, we think that they will drive -- they will double the expected growth from '24 to '26. So, it's really going to have significant impact. If we talk about '24, we think the impact will be smaller just because of : first, timing, the first AI PC will be introduced in the second half; and second, because of penetration, when we launch a new category, we know also it takes time for the category to penetrate. Our expectation is that in three years, 40% to 60% of the PCs will be AI PC, but it's going to be a gradual penetration of the category. But again, we are really excited, not only because of the impact that it will have on the business, but also because of the value -- additional value this is going to bring to our customers. Krish Sankar : Can you really quantify the ASP uplift? Enrique Lores : Thank you. Yes. So, what we had said before, and we haven't changed our projection is, average selling price for PCs will increase between 5% and 10%, as a consequence of the penetration of AI PC. Thank you. Krish Sankar : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could comment on supplies growth in the quarter. It was up sequentially. That hasn't happened in -- at any point in the last 10 years on an organic basis. So, what was driving the non-seasonal growth in supplies? Did you change prices and people bought in before? Or was there some channel fill? And then, could you also just comment on -- you talked a lot about Future Ready and the strength. I think you've taken out maybe run rate about $600 million worth of costs. But OpEx is essentially identical to the first quarter of this year. So, when we think about Future Ready, should we actually think about OpEx going down in fiscal '24? Or we won't see the impact of Future Ready on OpEx? Thank you. Marie Myers : Yeah. Hi, Toni. Good afternoon. So, let me just start out with the question on Future Ready. So first of all, obviously, really pleased with the performance, I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, for '23. And then, going into '24, as you know, we raised our target to $1.6 million in SAM. So, very much on track. And I think as we've discussed at SAM, Future Ready is a combination of both OpEx and cost of sales. So, some of those savings, we're reinvesting back in growth and in people to help us manage through some of the volatility, but we do also drop that through to the bottom-line. And frankly, Toni, you can see that in the rates that we even delivered in this last quarter and also in terms of how we're guiding the rates going forward in terms of solidly in the range for the year and really at the high-end of the range for both businesses in Q1. Now, OpEx will be up year-on-year, and it's driven by exactly those factors I mentioned earlier, the investments in our growth, the investments in our people. And I would just sort of add as a sort of closing comment around this is, if you look at the geography of the P&L, you could see in our gross margins that we're shifting out now to higher gross margins, and that's been partially offset by operating expenses. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit more context around how to think about Future Ready. And I'll turn it back to Enrique on supplies. I'll just add on the supplies' ecosystem, we're in good shape, Toni. From a multi-tier perspective, we ended the quarter in good shape. Enrique Lores : Yeah. So, let me complement that. So, I think there are multiple factors that drove the good performance of supplies in Q4. As I have said many times though, when we look at year-on-year compares, it's not the best way to look at the performance in a quarter because there are many adjustments that are done every quarter, and then comparisons can all -- can distort the overall perspective. We are driving many positive actions on supplies. We continue to grow share overall, which is something that we have been doing already for several quarters. We have increased prices to reflect the value that we bring. So, the combination of all these things help us to grow supplies quarter-on-quarter. And again, we are pleased with the performance. But in the long term, we continue to expect the supplies to decline low- to mid-single digits. We are not changing our projections for supplies in the future. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Asiya Merchant : Great. Thank you for the opportunity. A little bit on inventory. If you could just comment on how you look at the inventory in the channel, both on the PC and the Personal -- on the Print side as well? Specifically, in PCs, I think there was commentary that there was some elevated ones, when you spoke about it last quarter, not for HP but generally for the industry in general. And then, if you can just talk about the cadence of EPS? As you progress, if the second half is going to be stronger, I think, as was commented earlier, you're starting the first year -- first quarter up 10%, if math is correct, and you're ending for the year at 5% for the year. So, if you can just kind of walk through that, that would be great. Thank you. Marie Myers : So -- good afternoon, Asiya. So, why don't I just start out on the EPS sort of seasonality and how to think about it. So, in terms of Q1, just to sort of give you some context there, a third -- we usually have corporate other expense that hits in -- from a seasonality perspective, a third of that hits in Q1. So, if you look at our Q1 guide, just bear that in mind because that's typically the stock comp expense period. So, as a result of that, you're going to see that seasonality adjustment in our Q1 EPS. And as you correctly said, we're actually up, I think, 11% on the midpoint year-on-year in our Q1. But we're -- SAM guide, I'll just reiterate, of $325 million to $365 million, hasn't changed. And just to close, Q1 is just really typical seasonality. And then, if you think about channel inventory, both Personal Systems and Print were in really healthy shape, and we're pleased with where we landed in terms of the progress we made this quarter. I would add on Personal Systems that we've seen declines sequentially and that we are really now back to much more normalized levels. And in fact, the industry levels themselves are also normalizing. And you can see that in terms of the quality of our pricing in the last quarter as well. So, I think looking back, we've seen CI really return back to more normalized levels, particularly in Personal Systems and in Print as well. Asiya Merchant : Great. And if I can squeeze one more in on components, deflationary expectations, I think there was some commentary previously on how you think about components. Marie Myers : Yes. It's very much in-line with our SAM guide in terms of forward-looking. We expect both Print and PS to be headwinds for the year. And as we look into Q1, we do expect a headwind in PS, but a slight tailwind on Print. And then, in terms of just what you've seen in the quarter, we've seen tailwinds -- sorry, tailwinds and favorability on Print as well, but definitely headwinds for both businesses for the year. Asiya Merchant : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Jake on for Aaron. Thanks for the question. I was hoping you could give some additional color on the amount of promotional pricing for PCs you expect to see heading into the holiday season and maybe how this could compare to prior years. Enrique Lores : We expect to see a similar level of aggressiveness that we were seeing before channel inventory was high. And at this point, what we know about the holiday season is that based on the selling, the shipments we have been making, the strength of our portfolio, we have very good assortment on the stores. We have just introduced significant innovation across our full portfolio. So, we are optimistic about the holiday season in the coming weeks. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks. And then, I was also wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the growth you're seeing in Poly and maybe some of the momentum you expect with the new as-a-service subscription offering. Enrique Lores : Sure. We continue to be very bullish about the opportunities that we have with the Poly business. Of course, during the last week, it has been impacted -- during the last quarter, it has been impacted by macro. But feedback we get from our channel, from our customers continues to be very positive. As you said, we just introduced both new technology in the systems and the new as-a-service model, which we think will help us to drive growth in 2024. And really the opportunity to grow and to innovate continues to be there. From a process perspective, we are now finishing the IT integration based on the plan that we shared a few quarters ago. We have been driving the process as per plan. And again, we are happy with the progress we have made. I'm really optimistic about the opportunities this business is going to bring to us. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Erik Woodring : Great, thank you very much for taking my question. I just wanted to circle back to Toni's question on Print supplies. You obviously outperformed Print supplies this quarter. So, I just wanted to make sure I understood specifically, what drove the upside in the quarter. And given hard -- Print hardware units are declining 20% year-over-year, should -- what are the offsets to that as we think about supplies in the Four Box Model? I think you mentioned share gains in pricing. But if you could just go through kind of all the four different factors just to make sure we understand the different drivers, that would be helpful, for '24. Thank you. Enrique Lores : Perfect. Thank you, Erik. And thank you because when I was answering to Toni, I missed to mention one of the elements that also helped, which is the easy compare, because last -- Q4 last year was not a strong quarter for supplies. So, this also has an impact on the year-on-year compare. If I -- if we look at the Four Box Model and the different drivers of supplies, clearly, installed base has continued to decline. So, this is a negative factor. Usage continues to go down, which is a negative factor, though I have to say, continues to be above, especially the home, in space, the references and the projections that we were making before the pandemic. And then, two positive factors that have had an impact this quarter; one is pricing, we have increased prices for supplies, and market share. As I mentioned before, we have continued to grow share for supplies, which has a positive impact on the overall supplies growth. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ng from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Mike Ng : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I just have one for Marie and one for Enrique. Marie, you guided to PS and Print margins to be at the high-end of the range for the fiscal first quarter and then solidly in the range for the full year. Can you talk about some of the factors that drive that margin normalization for each of those two segments throughout the year? And then, Enrique, within Commercial Printing, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about any differences in outlook for A3 versus A4, or are the competitive dynamics very similar. Thank you very much. Marie Myers : Yes, sure, Mike. Good afternoon. Why don't I start out and give you some context on the ranges and how we're thinking about them. So, on PS, as we mentioned, we'd be at the high-end for Q1, and really what's driving that is just a combination of the mix. I think you heard Enrique talked to that in his prepared remarks, in terms of the higher value and also the improved pricing on -- as channel inventories normalizes. As I mentioned earlier, we saw a sequential improvement, and we expect, as a result, to see less promotional pricing. And then obviously, we've got the benefits of the Future Ready program that I talked about a moment ago with Toni. Obviously, also working against that are the headwinds that we've got with commodity costs and some of that is really what's influencing the sort of seasonality of the rates that we see in terms of being more solidly in the range as the year progresses. So that's sort of Personal Systems. And if you think about Print, similar drivers in terms of just being at the high-end of the range for Q1, and it's really driven by the profitability that we talked about, the shift in the model with supplies, some of the new business models. Also, frankly, the impact of growth is having an impact on both businesses. Similarly, the impact of the Future Ready. And once again, we also see pricing normalization and we see supplies -- there is no change to the supplies outlook to -- in terms of low- to mid-single digits. So, all those factors together is what really drives us to see both businesses be solidly in the range for the year, but at the high-end of the range for Q1. I'll turn it to Erique. Enrique Lores : Yeah. And just in your question about the office market in Print, two key comments. One is we have continued to shift change from A3 to A4, especially in Commercial -- in large Commercial customers. We think this is driven by the fact that we expect to see less printing -- people in the office. And therefore, they have reduced the printing volumes that they were expecting and they need less production type of products. So that has been one change. Second, in terms of both A4 and A3, we continue to see an opportunity to grow share. We did it in this quarter in A3, and we have started to grow our share in A4 in several geographies. We did it in North America -- in Americas. We did it in several countries in Europe. We did it in China. And we know we have some work to do, but we expect to continue to drive that during 2024. Mike Ng : Great. Thank you, Enrique. Thank you, Marie. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Enrique Lores for closing remarks. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Well, first of all, thank you, all of you for joining. With the Q4 results, we believe are a signal of the progress that we are making and increase the confidence that we have in the plan that we shared with all of you a few weeks ago. And this reinforces the key message that we shared at SAM, that we believe that HP shares are undervalued and continue to be a good investment. And then last but not least, for those of you in the U.S., let me close the call wishing all of you a very happy Thanksgiving. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

My name is Krista and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. At this time all participants will be in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I will now turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Orit Keinan-Nahon: Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to HP's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer and Tim Brown, HP's Interim Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is a webcast and a replay will be available on our website shortly after the call for approximately one year.

For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Enrique. Enrique Lores : Thank you, Orit, and thank you all for joining today's call. Let me begin by saying it was a solid start to the year. We delivered non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP EPS growth year-over-year and our future ready plan is positioning us well to deliver on our long-term growth targets. I'm going to focus my remarks today on our first quarter performance, our progress against key strategic priorities, and our expectations for the market for the balance of 2024. I will then turn the call over to Tim for a deeper dive into our financials and outlook. Starting with our results, we are managing through a volatile external environment that continues to impact demand across our industry. This is reflected in our top line with net revenue down 4% year-over-year. It's worth noting that the rate of revenue decline slowed for the third straight quarter, which we see as an encouraging sign of market stabilization. We continue to make progress in our key growth areas. We're maintaining our investments in a down market to strengthen our competitive position and there are several bright spots this quarter. We grew revenue and market share year-over-year in gaming. Orco Solutions delivered solid revenue growth and won several new accounts, including large global companies in the energy, retail, and telecommunication sectors, and we drove continued momentum in consumer subscriptions with Instant Ink delivering another quarter of revenue and net subscriber growth year-over-year. Alongside the progress we are making in our growth areas, we are also driving disciplined execution across the business. Non-GAAP operating profit dollars grew 5% year-over-year, and we delivered 11% non-GAAP EPS growth, which was right at the midpoint of our last quarter's guide. This reflects our focus on managing our mix, reducing our costs and maximizing operational efficiencies and we remain well on track to deliver on our three-year gross annual run rate structural cost savings target of $1.6 billion by fiscal year '25. Q1 was also a quarter of strong innovation across our portfolio. I'm particularly pleased with the progress we are making on the company-wide AI strategy we shared with you previously. As you will recall, we are focused on creating new product categories, expanding our digital services and solutions and driving internal productivity. We took a big stake forward this quarter at CES, where we launched our first laptops using Intel's new core ultra processors. This launch help us to win over 100 innovation awards at CES. More importantly, this is just the start of what will be an exciting year for AI PC innovation as we bring new products to market with our silicon and software partners in the coming quarters. Alongside the PC opportunity, we continue to develop new AI applications to run on top of our installed base of more than 200 million commercial devices. The best example of this is the workforce central platform we have discussed with you previously. We have since expanded and renamed the offering which we now refer to as the HP Workforce Experience platform. It integrates data and telemetry from our PC printer and poly devices into a single dashboard to improve productivity, security and collaboration, and it is now available to all of our managed solution customers. We're also shifting more of our offerings to subscriptions in consumer segment. This week, we will be launching our HP all-in subscription plan, which we previewed with you at our Investor Day last October. For a monthly fee, consumers will receive a printer in delivery premium 24/7 support and an option to upgrade their hardware every two years. This has tested extremely well in our pilots with customer satisfaction exceeding Instant Ink's already high scores. All of this gives us great momentum heading into our Amplify Partner Conference next week. Amplify is our largest channel event of the year, drawing our top 1,500 commercial resellers from around the world. We will have several of our top silicon and software partners with us to discuss the AIPC opportunity. And we will be launching a range of new innovations across personal systems, print and workforce solutions. In addition to our innovation, I'm really excited about the work we are doing to elevate the HP brand. To lead this work, I am pleased that Antonio Lucio, who joined HP last month as our Chief Marketing and Corporate Affairs Officer. Antonio was our first CMO following the creation of HP Inc. in 2015. Under his leadership, we strengthened our reputation as one of the world's most trusted brands. And you will see us launching new brand campaigns that are globally scalable and locally relevant. For example, earlier this month, we announced a multiyear deal with Real Madrid football club with millions of funds and more than 0.5 billion followers on social media, Real Madrid is one of the most loved brands. And as the club's newest technology partner, who will be collaborating to create new fun experiences. We also recently announced a global collaboration with Riot Games, one of the world's top game developers, and we will be working with them to develop future gaming products, technical innovation and co-branded marketing campaigns. Underpinning all of this, we are continuing to advance our sustainable impact strategy, which continues to drive innovation and help us to win new deals. I was proud to see HP ranked number 13 on this year's list, of America's most just companies from Just Capital and CNBC. This was our fifth straight year on the list and our highest ever ranking, up 34 spots year-over-year and putting us in the top 2% of companies measured. Let me now provide some additional color on our business unit performance. The external environment remains dynamic. In Consumer, we anticipate that a post-holiday slowdown, and this was a bit more pronounced than initially expected. Commercial customers remain cautious. While we saw signs of stabilization in the SMB and education markets, we saw a slowdown in U.S. enterprise and federal sales especially in the month of January. We also continue to see demand weakness in China due to challenging economic conditions, partially offset by strength in India. Personal Systems net revenue was $8.8 billion in the quarter. That's down 4% year-over-year or 5% in constant currency, reflecting market dynamics and seasonality. Consistent with the industry estimate, we continue to expect the PC market to grow low-single-digits in 2024 and we expect to grow at least in line with the market. Our PS team continued to show resilience and operational rigor, delivering operating profit of 6.1%, which was solidly within our long-term target range, so slightly below our expectations. Importantly, we once again gained PC share in calendar Q4, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. This shows that HP innovation is winning in the market, and we are winning in the right areas with a focus on high-value segments such as premium work stations and gaming. Peers services revenue was up year-over-year with strong growth in digital services. And while hybrid systems remains impacted by the current enterprise spending environment, we are investing in the portfolio for deferential market recovery and long-term growth opportunity. Turning to Print. Net revenue was $4.4 billion. That's down 5% year-over-year, reflecting market headwinds. China softness and the aggressive pricing environment. And I am pleased with the progress we are making on pricing and share gains in supply. We continue to effectively manage our costs and mix between consumer and commercial, with operating profit of 19.9%. We're also making progress on our efforts to regain profitable share. We gained share in big tanks, both year-over-year and sequentially and we drove sequential share gains in office in parts of Europe, India and China. We're also pleased with our progress in industrial graphics and 3D both of which grew revenue year-over-year in Q1. We also saw continued recovery in labels and packaging, and we are ramping up for Drupa in May. Held every four years, this is the world's largest printing event, where we will launch a range of new innovations to accelerate our momentum in the market. Consistent with the capital allocation strategy we have shared with you previously, we resumed share repurchases in Q1, and we plan to remain active in the market for the remainder of the year. Let me now close by providing some insight into how we see the market for the balance of the year. Despite pockets of softness in Q1, we saw signs of improvement overall. While we expect the pace of recovery to be uneven across different segments, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow targets. And as we said before, we expect performance in the second half of fiscal year '24 to be seasonally stronger than the first half. By remaining focused on things we can control and investing in our future, we have proven our ability to navigate current market dynamics while capitalizing on long-term growth opportunities. This is exactly what we did in Q1. And it what you can expect from us moving forward as we drive progress against our future trade plan. I now want to introduce Tim Brown. As you know, he took over as our interim CFO in January. For those of you that don't know, TIM is one of HP's most successful and respected financial executives. He has over 30 years of HP experience, including as CFO of Print and Personal Systems and he is a steady hand on the wheel while we complete our CFO search process. Tim, thank you for your leadership, over to you. Tim Brown : Thank you, Enrique, for the kind introduction. It's great to be with you all today. We are pleased with the progress we made during Q1 toward delivering on our financial commitments this year. On a year-on-year basis, our revenue declines continued to slow sequentially, consistent with the stabilizing trends we expected heading into the year. Non-GAAP operating profit dollars grew margins expanded in both Personal Systems and Print and non-GAAP EPS grew double digits. We remain on track with our future-ready plan to achieve our gross annual run rate structural cost savings target for this year and continue to reinvest these savings in our growth areas. We also returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders as we actively repurchased shares during the quarter. Top line results were impacted by lower market TAMs in both Personal Systems and Print. We saw cautious commercial demand as macro challenges persisted and a bit more pronounced slowdown than initially expected in consumer following Q4. As Enrique said, HP remains focused on executing each quarter while also driving long-term shareholder value. Our overall results reflect disciplined financial management and investment for sustainable profitable growth all while navigating a dynamic and competitive environment in the near term. We will continue to manage our business prudently while seizing opportunities to improve our market position as we continue to execute on our plan to deliver our fiscal year commitments. Now let me give you a closer look at the details. Net revenue was $13.2 billion in the quarter, down 4% nominally and 5% in constant currency, driven by declines across each of our regions. In constant currency, Americas declined 7%, EMEA declined 2%, and APJ declined 7%. APJ was impacted as soft demand in China continued. Gross margin was 21.9% in the quarter, up 1.7 points year-on-year primarily due to improved commodity and logistics costs and cost savings, partially offset by competitive pricing. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.8 billion or 13.5% of revenue. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses were driven primarily by investments in growth initiatives and higher marketing expenses, partially offset by lower variable compensation and structural cost reductions. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, up 5%. Non-GAAP net OI&E was $144 million, down primarily due to lower interest expense driven by a decrease in debt outstanding. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.08 or 11% to $0.81 with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $186 million, primarily related to amortization of intangibles restructuring and other charges, acquisition and divestiture-related charges and other tax adjustments. As a result, Q1 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.62. Now let's turn to segment performance. In Q1, Personal Systems revenue was $8.8 billion, down 4% or 5% in constant currency, driven by soft demand and an unfavorable mix shift partially offset by market share gains in both consumer and commercial, including categories such as premium notebooks and workstations. Total units were up 5% with consumer up 10% and commercial up 2%. Year-over-year growth rates for units and revenue improved sequentially in both consumer and commercial as stabilizing trends continued, consistent with our outlook for a PC market recovery this year. Drilling into the details, commercial revenue was down 5% and consumer down 1%. ASPs were flat quarter-over-quarter, driven by a favorable mix, including improved commercial premium mix offset primarily by an unfavorable mix shift in consumer. We remain focused on driving profitable revenue and share growth in both our consumer and commercial markets. Personal Systems delivered $537 million of operating profit with operating margins of 6.1%. Our margin increased 0.9 points year-over-year, primarily due to lower commodity and logistics costs and cost savings. This was partially offset by pricing and investments in growth areas. Sequentially, our operating margin declined primarily due to higher commodity costs and marketing expenses, offset in part by favorable mix towards our commercial business segment. In Print, we remain focused on improving our execution and driving rigorous cost management as we navigate a challenging and competitive print market. In Q1, total Print revenue was $4.4 billion, down 5%, both nominally and in constant currency. The decline was driven by declines in hardware. Hardware revenue was down 19%, driven by lower volumes attributable primarily to continued weak demand in China and Greater Asia and share loss largely due to aggressive pricing by our Japanese competitors. Total hardware units decreased 17% year-over-year. Industrial Graphics grew revenue again this quarter, driven by hardware, supplies and services. By customer segment, commercial revenue decreased 12% with units down 18%. Consumer revenue decreased 22% with units down 15%. The market for big tank printers continue to increase sequentially, partially offsetting continued soft demand and aggressive pricing in the traditional home ink market. In Consumer Services, Instant Ink revenue and subscribers continued to grow year-over-year. Total subscribers now exceed 13 million, including more than 700,000 subscribers to our Instant paper add-on service. Supplies revenue was $2.9 billion, flat on a reported basis and up 1% in constant currency primarily driven by favorable pricing actions, share gains and an easy compare, partially offset by a lower installed base. Print operating profit was $872 million, essentially flat year-over-year and operating margin of 19.9%. Operating margin increased 1 point driven by lower hardware volumes, cost improvements, including lower variable compensation and supplies pricing, partially offset by hardware pricing headwinds. Regarding our structural cost saving initiatives, we continued the momentum we had exiting FY '23, making progress in Q1 against our year two goals of our three-year plan. We are on track to deliver on our $1.6 billion gross annual run rate structural cost savings goal exiting 2025, including achieving approximately 30% of those savings in FY '24. Recall that we expect to generate these savings across both our cost of sales and OpEx line items, enhancing our margin performance and enabling investments in our key growth areas. Consistent with previous quarters, we continue to benefit from portfolio simplification initiatives in both Personal Systems and Print, digital transformation, automation and process improvements, leveraging our AI capabilities and structural cost reductions across our business. We still expect to incur one-time restructuring cost of approximately $1 billion over the term of our plan, including approximately $0.3 billion of primarily cash charges in the fiscal year '24. Now let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q1 cash flow from operations was approximately $120 million and free cash flow was $25 million. Our results were impacted by normal seasonality associated with the timing of variable compensation payments and sequentially lower volumes in Personal Systems. The cash conversion cycle was minus 29 days in the quarter. This increased three days sequentially due to days of inventory increasing four days, days payable decreasing one day and days receivable decreasing two days. The increase in DOI was driven primarily by an increase in strategic buys and C shipments during the quarter partially offset by our progress on optimizing our operational inventory, as we have discussed in the past. In Q1, we returned approximately $775 million to shareholders, including $500 million in share repurchases and $275 million in cash dividends. We continue to prudently manage our leverage ratio and finished the quarter within our target leverage range. We resumed share repurchases in Q1, and we expect to return 100% of our FY '24 free cash flow to shareholders. As we have previously stated, we are committed to returning 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders over time. As long as our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains below 2 times, and unless higher ROI opportunities arise. Looking forward to Q2 and the rest of FY \u201824, we expect the macro and demand environments will remain challenged and that our customer end markets will continue to be very competitive. We remain focused on rigorously managing costs, improving our performance and investing in growth. Specifically, keep the following in mind related to our FY '24 and Q2 financial outlook. Given the challenging macro environment, we are modeling multiple scenarios based on several assumptions. For FY '24, we continue to see a wide range of potential outcomes, which are reflected in our outlook ranges. Consistent with the view we shared in November, we expect the performance in the second-half of fiscal '24 will be seasonally stronger than the first-half. Regarding OI&E expense, we continue to expect it to be approximately $0.7 billion in FY '24. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.6 billion in FY '24 with the second-half of the year stronger than the first. Our free cash flow outlook does include approximately $300 million of restructuring cash outflows. Turning to Personal Systems. We continue to expect the overall PC market unit TAM to recover over the course of this year, increasing by a low-single-digit percent. Specifically for Q2, we expect Personal Systems revenue will decline sequentially by a high-single-digit, in line with typical seasonality. We expect Personal Systems margins to be solidly within our long-term target range in Q2 as the PC market continues to recover and has strong cost management and pricing actions helped to offset rising commodity costs. For FY \u201824, we expect margins to be solidly within our long-term target range, driven by improved PC market demand, a seasonally stronger second-half of the year, continued mix improvements partially offset by higher commodity costs. In Print, we expect consumer demand will remain soft and pricing competitive, while market uncertainty continues to impact our commercial print business. Disciplined cost and mix management should help to partially offset these trends, driving flattish revenue sequentially in Q2 below typical seasonality. We expect Q2 supplies revenue to be down mid-single-digit in constant currency, and we still expect Supplies revenue will decline low to mid-single-digits for the year. Quarterly results can vary. For Q2, we expect print margins to be at the high end of our 16% to 19% range and solidly within the range for FY '24. We continue to focus on driving print operating profit dollars through new business models and rigorous cost management, including future-ready transformation savings. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook for Q2 and fiscal year 2024. We expect second quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.86 and second quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.68. We expect FY \u201824 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.65 and FY '24, GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.61 and $3.01. In closing, we started off our new fiscal year making solid progress against our strategic objectives and full year commitments while managing through demand and competitive challenges that have persisted in the current dynamic environment. We remain focused on disciplined execution and cost management and are confident that we have the right people, the right assets and the right strategy to deliver for both our customers and our shareholders for the long-term. I'll stop here so we can open the lines for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today will be from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. And sorry, if I'm having an echo, but sorry, that's coming across at your end as well. Maybe just to talk about the expectations for the year you are outlining seasonally strong second half to be the driver of your full year guidance. Maybe you can match that out on something the geography for market consumer or what's in order to decide where you expect people to be stronger second-half to second-half. Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions. Enrique Lores : Of course, thank you, Samik, for the question. Let me take that one. So as you say and as we said in our prepared remarks, we are expecting a stronger second half than first-half of the year, and there are multiple drivers for that. First of all, we expect some recovery in the commercial space. Second, also traditional seasonality consumer is stronger in the second half than in the first half. And then internally, we will see more impact from all of our cost reduction efforts that we will also be having a bigger impact in the second half. If we go for the different segments, especially in the PC space, we also expect to see an impact from the winter reference that as you know, will be happening in the coming quarters, and this will have an impact. And then on the print space, mostly on commercial and industrial, we also expect to see some recovery. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. Enrique, the share gains you noted in the front end, both in big tank and also in office. What would you attribute that to, given you noted like a very aggressive pricing environment and also a weak period for print hardware. What are some of the levers you're using for some of the share gain. Enrique Lores : Sure. There are slightly different, Wamsi. On the big tank side, during the last month, we have completed our portfolio. We have now a very complete lineup of products on the low end to products that will also be working on the home office side. And as we have completed that, as we are launching that into the different markets, we are starting to see the impact of the innovation that we brought to market. On the office side, as we highlighted a few quarters ago, we acknowledged that we have some operational work to do to address and to be able to regain some of the share that we have lost. We have been actively working on that. We have started to make progress. We are starting to see that in the progress that we are making quarter-over-quarter. That has been more relevant in some regions like Europe, China, India. But we will continue to work on that because our goal is to continue to regain share in both categories. Thank you. Wamsi Mohan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Please Go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on the question about second-half strength. It sounds like you expect your printing margins to fall pretty notably in the second half. You were 20% this quarter. We're expecting to be at the high end of the range in the second quarter to be solidly in the range for the second half that would imply printing margins fall considerably. And that's probably possible given that hardware weakness has been pretty strong the last few quarters, and that may translate into weakening supplies growth and therefore, lower margins. So I'm just trying to reconcile if 65% of your profits are going to have lower margins, perhaps notably lower margins in the second half of the year per your guidance? Why are you optimistic? And if I just roll out normal seasonality right now, it points to 4% decline in revenues. Are you expecting revenues to grow in fiscal '24? Tim Brown : Yes. So let me take that, Toni. First of all, just from a general perspective on print, we do expect to be, as you said, at the high end of the range in Q2 and the -- kind of -- solidly in the range of 16%, 19% for the year. And part of that is driven by what you said where we're trying to drive our mix from a hardware perspective up that does change the rate a little bit. And we aren't changing really what we expect from a supplies perspective where we expect Q2, as I noted in the prepared remarks, to be down mid-single-digits in constant currency and then low to mid-single-digits for the year. So I think that mix is really what's kind of driving the potential for that rate to move back a little bit through the course of the year. From an overall perspective, we expect PS as we said, to be seasonally stronger in the second-half, and that will drive -- and we'll be in the middle point of the range there. And then from a growth perspective, we do expect PS to grow in low single digits, kind of the 2% to 4% range and print will be flattish to down for the course of the year. Enrique Lores : And Toni, I think another clarification. When we look at H1 '24 versus H1 '23, H2 '24 versus H2 '23, EPS will be growing around 7% in the first-half. If you look at the midpoint of our guide, it will be growing 4% in the midpoint of our guide. So we are expecting growth, but the growth will be slightly lower with the projections that we're making today in the second-half. And as we have said before, we've managed the company to grow operating profit dollars. We don't manage it to deliver on the margin guide we provide. We provide it because we know it's important for modeling, but this is not what the way we manage the company internally. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lu from UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Luke : Hey, thank you for taking the question. This is Brian Luke in for David. So in your view, what are the key drivers and milestones for AI-enabled PCs to get traction with commercial customers. Are customers currently in possession of devices today based on the financial benefits of more robust PC. Enrique Lores : So first of all, let me say that we remain extremely excited about the opportunity that AI PCs will bring in terms of both the customer value that they will deliver in terms of security, in terms of latency, in terms of cost and also the impact it will have over time in the company. I think milestones come from two -- three different angles. First of all, we need to deliver the hardware to be able to support these new models, and we are working on that with the key silicon providers to make sure that we have a wide range of products and a very solid portfolio. Second, we need to make sure that the applications support that and we are working with all the keys of our companies again to make sure they understand the new capabilities and that they build them into their applications. And third is training both in terms of our customers, but also in terms of the sales teams, either HP or the resellers that will be selling that. And we are working on all fronts. Our projections continue to be that three years after launch, the penetration of AI PCs will be somewhere between 40% and 60% of the total sales that we will be making. And that growth is going to be gradual. There will be some impact in '24. But since this will be at the end of the year, fiscal year for us, the impact will be modest. If the impact would be bigger in '25 and the impact will be bigger in '26. But really from both an innovation and customer value is going to be very significant for our portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Erik Woodring : Great, thank you so much for taking my question. Enrique, you know, again, nice performance on the supply side, you outperformed expectations for a second consecutive quarter. I'm going to ask you the same question I asked you last quarter, which is just if you can talk about the four-box model and kind of the different factors that are impacting supplies performance? And then if we kind of port that over to the rest of the year, you've been flat to growing over the last quarters on the supply side. What are the factors that are driving the deceleration to low to mid-single-digit declines for the entirety of the year, implying the rest of the year deteriorates from here? Thanks so much. Enrique Lores : Thank you, Erik. And my answer is going to be very similar to the answer I gave you last quarter. So first of all, let me also share that, as we have said many times, looking at quarter-on-quarter comparisons is not a bad way to understand the health of the projections for the Supplies business because each quarter, many things happened that have an impact on the growth comparison quarter-on-quarter. And second, we are not changing the long-term projections for supplies of low to mid-single-digit decline nor the projections that we have for 24, but also, we expect it to be low single low to mid-single digits and no changes in our projections. In terms of what of the performance this quarter, there are as always multiple factors. First of all, we continue to manage our share and to gain share of supplies. This has always a positive impact. Second, pricing, we have made some pricing adjustments that are having positive impact and also at last quarter, we need to acknowledge that the compare is easy because supplies were declining in Q1 '23, so that comparison is also positive. On the other side, again, similar to what we discussed last quarter, we continue to see negative impact from usage and negative impact from the size of the installed base that has been shrinking. And then maybe to close a comment on channel inventory that I know is something of interest, channel inventory for supplies and actually for the rest of the business, stays in a very healthy position. So we are in a good position there. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryani from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Lauren Lucas : This is Lauren on for Amit. I was wondering if you guys could talk a bit about what gives a few conviction for the recovery in the commercial space given the pockets of weakness that you guys saw in Q1? Thanks. Enrique Lores : Thank you. So first of all, I think we -- I would like to start by acknowledging that it's not only our projection, but it's really the projection that we see from industry analysts and also from the rest of the key players in the industry and there are multiple factors. I mentioned before the fact that we expect to see more impact from the Windows refresh cycle that is starting, and this will have a bigger impact on the second-half. We also expect to see a positive impact from pricing and mix, given that we expect component cost to increase, but this will also have a positive impact. And then when we look at what we saw this quarter, we have seen more stability on the SMB space. We have seen also more stability in the education space. We started to see growth in Europe on the PC side that has not happened in a long time. So while we continue to see some areas of weakness like China or, for example, the federal business in the U.S. that we saw softness in January. We continue to believe that the overall market will be improving in the second-half. Thank you. Lauren Lucas : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Asiya Merchant : Great. Thank you for taking my question. If I may, just given the conviction that you have that commercial will see improvement, maybe if you could talk a little bit about the peripheral side of your business, how that track. And overall, how did the growth portion of your business do as we started the year in '24, in fiscal '24? Enrique Lores : Sure. Thank you, thank you, Asiya. So let's see, in terms of peripherals, as you are indicating, they have been impacted by the cautiousness that we have seen on the commercial side. And as the commercial market will recover, we expect them -- they will be recovering as well. And this is why we have continued to invest in innovation in these categories because we think that long term is a great growth opportunity for us, and this is confirmed both by our customers, our clients and also by resellers. In terms of the growth areas we -- several of them started to grow, which was really a very positive sign. We -- and for example, we -- for me, personally the fact that both services businesses, both our Workforce Solutions business, and our Consumer Services business grew in Q1 is a very important sign of recovery, also because of the strategic importance that this business has for the medium and long-term for the company. And I think something I would like to highlight to close is tomorrow, we are going to be launching on the consumer services side, the first subscription where we will be integrating hardware into the plan is something that we shared at our Investor Day. Finally, we will be releasing that tomorrow. And again, it's an important step because you know that one of the key directions we have for the long term is to offer our full portfolio as a subscription. And this will be the first time we are offering for consumers our hardware as well, and you will see us expanding the line over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ng from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Mike Ng : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I just wanted to follow-up on the commentary around Personal Systems pricing. What drove some of the pricing dynamics in the quarter? I know you guys called out improved commercial mix, but there was also an unfavorable mix shift in consumer. Could you provide a little bit more color there? And maybe just talk a little bit more about your outlook for ASP for the full-year, whether for the industry or for HP. Thank you. Enrique Lores : Sure. So let me start and maybe Tim will be making additional comments. When we look at Q1 performance quarter-over-quarter, which we think is the best indicator to look at -- to monitor progress. PC prices were flattish, driven by commercial. Commercial prices were up and the mix moved a bit to consumer, when -- which means that from a mix perspective, we saw a positive impact. But at the same time, rates were down, mostly driven by price pressure that we saw in the low end of the portfolio, especially in the consumer side. And we think that this is a consequence of some of the softness that we saw in some of the consumer markets during the last quarter. But going forward, as commodity costs will increase and also as we see price as mix will evolve more towards commercial, we expect to see an overall increase of PC prices. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks for taking my question. This is [Stephen] (ph) calling on behalf of Chris. Enrique, I wanted to ask you about the print business. In terms of the [Technical Difficulty] that you come [Technical Difficulty] your Japanese peers, I was wondering if you're also seeing that applied on the commercial and supply hardware and also supply portion of your commercial business, especially within the context of any long-term managed contracts and work for solutions? Thank you. Enrique Lores : Thank you. So far, the pressure that we are seeing is mostly on the consumer side. And this is very similar to the trend that we explained last quarter where we -- given where the exchange rate between dollar and yen and euro and yes. Clearly, this is giving a strong advantage to some of our competitors in that space, and we are seeing that in the prices that they are going after. And this is why in the consumer side, you have seen us especially on the more traditional categories we have decided not to go after certain deals because these will be unprofitable customers that we are not interested in targeting. On the commercial side, we have seen more stability. There might be some risk of stabilization. We have some of that in our modeling, but all of this is built into the guide that we have provided today. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron, your line is open. Jacob Wilhelm : Hi, sorry about that. This is Jake on for Aaron. I was just hoping you can get some additional color on your industrial graphics business. It seems like over the past few quarters, you're seeing a little bit more momentum there. So I was just hoping to see how you need it throughout the remainder of the year? Enrique Lores : Yes. Thank you. So you said it well. We have started to see some momentum in that part of the business. especially in the labels and packaging side, we have seen some good recovery. And we -- you know that we -- in May '24, there is this big show called [Drupal] (ph), which is like the print -- major printing event and happens every 4 years. We are -- we have prepared a lot of new products and services that we will be launching them. And they usually have a fairly positive impact in the quarters after that. So we are expecting to see that happening in '24. But good recovery and very good expectations for '24 as Drupal as we will be launching a new set of products and solutions there. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer session today. I will now turn the call back over to Enrique Lores for closing remarks. Enrique Lores : Perfect. Thank you. So thank you all for joining today. And I'd like to close with 3 messages. First of all, as you saw, Q1 was a solid quarter and a solid way to start the year, where we grew both operating profit and EPS. We remain positive about the outlook that we provided a few quarters, a few months ago about the rest of the year. And as we said, we expect -- continue to expect a stronger second-half than first-half. And we also remain very confident in the long-term, especially driven by the opportunities at both hybrid work and AI are bringing to us as a company and the innovation that we are going to be launching around that. So Again, thank you for joining us today and looking forward to continue to talk in the future. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

Enrique Lores : Thank you, Orit, and thank you all for joining today's call. When we started the fiscal year, we committed to very specific goals, drive profitable growth in our core, accelerating key growth areas and deliver operational efficiency. I am pleased to say we accomplished this and delivered a solid quarter and first half. The focus of our teams and actions we have taken continue to drive results and build momentum. We delivered non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP EPS growth on a sequential and year-over-year basis. We made good progress against our future ready plan and we continue to invest in innovative technologies with a strong emphasis on AI and hybrid. Today, I will cover our second quarter results, including the recovery we are starting to see in commercial PCs, progress against our strategic priorities, key innovations we are bringing to market and our expectations for the remainder of fiscal year 2024. Then I will turn the call over to Tim for a deeper dive into our financials and outlook. I will start with our results. We continue to navigate well a dynamic and competitive environment. While our net revenue was down 1%, the rate of decline slowed for the fourth straight quarter. Personal Systems also returned to growth for the first time in eight quarters. This is a good indicator of overall market stabilization and solid execution. Non-GAAP operating profit grew 2% and non-GAAP EPS was up 4% year-over-year, which was slightly above the midpoint of our last quarter's guidance. In terms of new innovations, Q2 was one of our most significant quarters. At our Amplify Partner Conference in March, we showcased over 100 AI-enabled solutions redefining productivity and collaboration. This event is our largest annual channel conference attracting over 1,500 of our top partners from 95 countries. It inspired our partners and will help us to drive long-term sustained growth. Let me share some of the key innovations we announced. For the more than 0.5 million data scientists, who are using our workstation solutions to create AI models that improve company workflows, we had a lot to share. We announced the HP AI Creation Center, the world's most comprehensive workstation solutions for AI development. And we unveiled a strategic collaboration with NVIDIA to integrate their pre-trained models and software into our AI studio set of tools. They will allow customers to access, share and edit their data science workflows more easily from anywhere. At the same time, we launched the industry's largest portfolio of AI PCs, the first to deliver the benefits of running AI locally on the device for improved performance, efficiency and privacy. In Print, we shared how AI will unlock opportunities to make printing smarter, more efficient and more personalized. And we unveiled our new color laser jet series optimized for small and medium businesses. We also stepped up in our key growth areas. In hybrid systems, we expanded our portfolio of room solutions with Poly Studio 360 degree camera, enabling more immersive meeting experiences. In workforce solutions, we introduced an enhanced workforce experience platform, providing CIOs with an AI enabled digital experience to unlock the full potential of their teams. In addition, we are enabling our partners and sales teams to capitalize on the AI opportunity. We have introduced the industry's first ever role based AI MasterClass training and certification program. Doubling down on our momentum, last week at the Microsoft Copilot+ PC event, we introduced the world's most powerful ultra-mobile next-gen AI PCs. Designed from the ground up, they enable on-the-go leaders and freelancers to harness the most powerful AI technologies available. We also showcased our new AI Helix logo that helps you easily identify and select this new category of devices. Initial reaction has been overwhelmingly positive with our next-gen devices being recognized as some of the most premium announced and having beyond cutting-edge hardware. We are already helping customers unlock tangible value from their AI PCs. For example, collaborating with Deloitte Consulting, together we have created an on-device assistant to drive efficiency around common IT support challenges. The solution has the potential to return close to 100,000 hours of productivity to their practitioners. This is a powerful example of the positive impact of AI PCs. One of HP's most important assets is the strength of our brand and we continue to invest in it to build even greater value. This quarter, we announced our historic title partnership with Scuderia Ferrari. This is an opportunity to elevate our brand and reach new audiences and geographies, particularly younger and premium customers. It also improves the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing spend. And we are excited to work with Scuderia Ferrari, leveraging the latest HP innovations to help them drive their competitive advantage. HP is a trusted brand. We are a company that stands for more than just the products we make. For the fifth year in a row, HP has earned a AAA rating from CDP. Next month, we will release our Annual Sustainable Impact Report, outlining the progress we are making towards our climate action, human rights and digital equity goals. Let me now share in more detail what we saw in each of our businesses in Q2. In Personal Systems, we executed our strategy driving both revenue growth and increasing profitability year-over-year. The PS revenue was $8.4 billion, that's up 3% year-over-year, driven mainly by market growth and signs of commercial recovery. Our PS operating profit was 6%, in line with our expectations and solidly within our long-term target range. Our teams continue to show their focus by driving profitable PC share in calendar Q1 in high-value categories like commercial premium and mobile workstations. Importantly, we continue to invest and grow in high value and key growth areas. In gaming, we grew revenue year-over-year again this quarter. PS services was up with strong growth in managed services. And in hybrid systems, we saw signs of recovery. Here we drove sequential growth and strong performance in video collaboration. We remain confident that this evolving market will be a long-term growth opportunity. In the second half, we expect to see the introduction of AI PCs accelerate demand over and above the anticipated PC refresh cycle and Windows 11 rollout. We believe the AI opportunity in front of us will help drive higher ASPs and premium mix. We have a comprehensive portfolio of AI-enabled devices from consumer, commercial, gaming, accessories, room solutions to advanced workstation solutions. We're innovating beyond hardware with software and security solutions like HP AI companion and HP Wolf Security that uses deep learning, behavior analysis and AI based protection against malware and deep fakes. We have rich history and proven track-record of integrating meaningful AI technologies, such as noise removal and gesture controls. Together with our strong innovation pipeline, we are well-positioned to capture the opportunity and lead the industry. Turning to Print, results were in line with what we expected. Revenue was $4.4 billion, down 8% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. We continue to see soft demand, particularly in China and some parts of Europe. The pricing environment remains competitive in consumer with intensifying pressure in commercial. We continued to make progress on pricing and share gains in supplies with revenue results as expected. We delivered Print operating profit of 19%, in line with our guidance. Once again, we demonstrated disciplined cost management, improved mix and the benefits of the strong innovations we have brought to market. Our focus in Print remains on regaining profitable share and we are making progress. We grew share quarter-over-quarter in home and in office. Importantly, we gained share year-over-year and sequentially in big tanks and business ink. We also grew in key growth areas like consumer services. We saw growth in revenue and in subscriber numbers across instant ink and our new all-in plans. In industrial graphics, we continue to accelerate the adoption of digital technologies. In Q2, we grew year-over-year and for the third straight quarter. We also expanded our portfolio, adding new end-to-end automation processes leveraging AI and robotics. These are on full display right now at Drupa 2024, the largest trade fair for the printing and graphics industry worldwide. 3D continued to be impacted by elongated purchasing cycles in Q2, reflecting constraints on capital spending. The decline in hardware was partially offset by growth in services and supplies. Overall, in Q2, we made good progress against our future ready strategy. We continue to execute according to plan and we are on track to deliver on our three-year annual growth run-rate, structural cost savings target of $1.6 billion by the end of fiscal year 2025. We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and expect to return approximately 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal year 2024 and over time as long as our gross leverage ratio remains below two times and unless higher ROI opportunities arise. Looking forward to Q3 and the second half of fiscal year '24, we expect the demand environment will remain dynamic and that our markets will continue to be very competitive. That said, we're encouraged by the progress we have made delivering a solid first half and we expect a stronger second half. The anticipated commercial PC refresh as well as early gains from the AI PC, together with our plans to gain share in Print, gives us confidence we are well-positioned to drive growth in our core businesses. At the same time, we see significant opportunities to accelerate in our key growth areas. As you have seen repeatedly, we are delivering to expectations and will continue to maintain our focus as we enter the second half. We remain confident in our strategy and we'll continue to execute on our plan. Let me now turn it over to Tim. Tim Brown : Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid financial results in Q2, driven by disciplined financial management and focused execution while navigating a dynamic and competitive environment. We are pleased with our continued progress we made in Q2 toward delivering on our financial commitments. Total revenue decline slowed further. Our gross profit dollars and margin, our non-GAAP operating profit dollars and margin, and our non-GAAP EPS, all improved both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. In addition, we generated solid free cash flow. We achieved these results while simultaneously reinvesting in our key growth areas and in AI and managing through a mixed market environment characterized by slightly stronger PS commercial performance, balanced against continuing Print market demand challenges. Now let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was $12.8 billion in the quarter, down 1%, both nominally and in constant currency. In constant currency, Americas increased 2%, EMEA declined 3% and APJ declined 5%. APJ was impacted as soft demand in China continued. Gross margin was 23.6% in the quarter, up one point year-over-year, primarily due to lower commodity and logistics costs and cost savings, partially offset by unfavorable mix and competitive pricing. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion or 14.8% of revenue. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by continued investments in higher variable compensation partially offset by cost reductions. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, up 2%. Non-GAAP net OI&E was $158 million, down primarily due to lower interest expense driven by a decrease in debt outstanding. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.03 or 4% to $0.82 with a diluted share count of approximately one billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $205 million, primarily related to amortization of intangibles, restructuring and other charges, acquisition and divestiture related charges, non-operating retirement related credits and other tax adjustments. As a result, Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.61. Now let's turn to segment performance. In Q2, Personal Systems revenue was $8.4 billion, up 3% or 2% in constant currency, driven by higher volumes led by commercial, partially offset by a decline in ASPs and continued weakness in China. Total units were up 7% with consumer down 1% and commercial up 12%. Personal Systems revenue returned to growth exceeding our expectations. We are encouraged by the positive momentum exiting Q2 as we head into the seasonally stronger second half of the year. Drilling into the details, consumer revenue was down 3% and commercial revenue was up 6%, representing greater than 70% of Personal Systems revenue. ASPs were flat quarter-over-quarter driven by a favorable mix shift toward commercial and increased consumer pricing, offset largely by an increased mix of lower end devices. While our market share declined in calendar Q1, as competition intensified, we drove share improvements in high value categories, including mobile workstations and commercial premium. We remain focused on driving profitable revenue and share growth in both our consumer and commercial markets. Last week, we announced the launch of our next-gen AI PC, which is part of a series of launches planned for this year that will expand our portfolio of AI PCs as we enable our customers to deploy advanced AI technology at the edge. Personal Systems delivered $508 million of operating profit with operating margins of 6.0%. Our margin increased 0.7 points year-over-year, driven by lower commodity and logistics costs and cost savings, including Future Ready savings, offset partially by competitive pricing and investments. In Print, our results reflected our focus on improving execution and diligently managing cost as we continue to navigate a very competitive Print market. In Q2, total Print revenue was $4.4 billion, down 8% on a reported basis and down 7% in constant currency. The decline was driven by declines in both hardware and supplies. Hardware revenue was down 18% year-over-year, driven by lower volumes attributable primarily to continued weak demand, especially in China and EMEA as well as share loss in both home and office due to aggressive pricing, partially driven by further depreciation of the yen. Total hardware units decreased 17% year-over-year. Industrial Graphics grew revenue for the third consecutive quarter, driven by supplies and service, offsetting softer hardware demand as we believe our customers delayed purchasing decisions in anticipation of Drupa, which started yesterday. By customer segment, commercial revenue decreased 12% with units down 17%. Consumer revenue decreased 16% with units down 17%. In big tank, we increased our volumes and market share sequentially, partially offsetting continued market softness and competitive pricing in the traditional home ink market. In consumer services, we drove revenue and subscriber growth in both our instant ink and all-in plans. Supplies revenue was $2.9 billion, down 5% on a reported basis and down 4% in constant currency. This was in line with our outlook. Print operating profit was $829 million, down 8% year-over-year and operating margin was 19%. Operating margin was flat year-over-year, driven by disciplined cost management, including Future Ready savings and favorable mix offset by competitive hardware pricing. Turning to our Future Ready transformation plan. We are on track to achieve our fiscal year end '24 goal of delivering a cumulative 70% of our year end '25 goal of gross annual run-rate structural cost savings of $1.6 billion. We expect to achieve this by driving efficiencies in our core businesses. We are pleased with our progress in reducing our costs across Print and PS. We continue to see the benefits of initiatives we launched in prior quarters. For example, we continue to optimize our location strategy with plans for additional site actions this year. In our digital transformation initiatives, we are accelerating our generative AI capabilities, including rolling out AI tools such as GitHub Copilot to approximately 60% of our developers as well as implementing HP specific large language models to improve efficiencies across our sales and service organizations. In marketing, we continue to optimize and in house our digital media capabilities and maximize programmatic investments. Specifically, we are delivering savings through AI-enhanced capabilities, scaling content production and working towards translation cost efficiencies, helping us improve our NPI marketing efficiency with lower agency costs and next-gen market insights and measurement. In PS, we are simplifying our portfolio as we announced last week, our brand simplification strategy across our consumer and commercial portfolios. Now let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q2 cash flow from operations was approximately $581 million and free cash flow was $481 million, driven by net earnings. The cash conversion cycle was minus 31 days in the quarter. This decreased two days sequentially due to days inventory increasing nine days, days payable increasing 16 days and days receivable increasing five days. The increase in DOI was driven primarily by an increase in strategic buys and sea shipments, both of which drive economic value. The strategic buys continue to allow us to take advantage of attractive economic offerings from suppliers to reduce the near-term financial impact of rising commodity costs. The increase in DPO was driven by an increase in accounts payable due to purchase timing and higher strategic buy inventory. In Q2, we returned approximately $369 million to shareholders, including $100 million in share repurchases and $269 million in cash dividends. We finished the quarter within our target leverage range and expect to return approximately 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in FY'24 and over time as long as our gross leverage ratio remains below two times and the less higher ROI opportunities arise. Looking forward to the second half of FY'24 keep the following in mind related to our FY'24 and Q3 financial outlook. As Enrique said, we expect performance in the second half of fiscal '24 will be seasonally stronger than the first half. We continue to model multiple scenarios based on several assumptions. For FY'24, we are narrowing our non-GAAP EPS outlook range to $0.30, but we continue to see a range of potential outcomes for H2 '24, which is reflected in our updated outlook. We remain focused on improving our cost structure and our performance while continuing to invest in our growth businesses. Regarding OI&E expense, we now expect it will be approximately $0.6 billion in FY'24. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.6 billion for FY'24, improving sequentially in both fiscal Q3 and Q4. As a reminder, our free cash flow outlook includes approximately $300 million of restructuring cash outflows. Turning to Personal Systems, specifically for Q3, we expect Personal Systems revenue will increase sequentially by a high-single-digit, though slightly less than typical seasonality. We expect Personal Systems margins to be towards the high end of our long-term target range of 5% to 7% in Q3, augmented by disciplined cost management actions. For FY'24, we expect Personal Systems margins to be solidly within our long-term target range, driven by improved PC revenue in the back half of the year, continued mix improvements and cost efficiencies. In Print, we expect Print to stabilize in the second half of the year, consistent with the market outlook. For Q3, we expect Print revenue to decrease sequentially by low-single-digit, in line with typical seasonality. We continue to expect supplies revenue in FY'24 to decline by a low to mid-single-digit in constant currency. For Q3, we expect Print margins to be in the upper half of our 16% and 19% range and now expect FY'24 margins to be at the high-end of the range, driven by rigorous cost management. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook for Q3 and fiscal year 2024. We expect third quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.92 and third quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.77. We expect FY'24 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.60 and FY'24 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.90. I'll stop here so we can open the lines for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today will be Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Erik Woodring : Great. Thank you guys very much for taking my questions. Enrique, maybe if I turn to you first. At the start of the year, you had talked about the Print business kind of performing in line with the market at roughly flat this year. Year-to-date, it's declining, let's call it mid-single-digits. You're telling us supplies will continue to decline low to mid-single-digits, but you expect the market to stabilize in the second half of the year. And so maybe my first question is, why do you believe other than easier year-over-year compares, the Print market will stabilize in the second half of the year? Are there any of the underlying factors that have impacted the Print business? Are any of those changing as you look to the second half like yen competition and broader market trends? And then as we think about hardware seasonality in the second half of the year, should we still be thinking about an improving trend sequentially there? How does that translate to year-over-year growth? If you could unpack all of that just for Print, that would be super helpful. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Enrique Lores : Thank you, Erik. It's a long question, so I'll try to cover all your points. So, first of all, in terms of what do we see from a competitive perspective, as you mentioned, we continue to see fairly strong competition in the consumer side, similar to what we were seeing in Q1 where we have seen an intensified competition is in the office space, driven by the main -- similar reasons and what we have -- what has happened in consumer. But this clearly has evolved. When we think about the second half, we expect the market to stabilize. And you mentioned one of the key reasons, which is an easier compare to what we had in the second half of 2023. Our underlying drivers that give us some confidence in this number, first of all is what we are seeing from a usage perspective that usage has been fairly stable, especially in the office space per printer, which is always a good indicator of what is going to be the overall performance from a printer perspective. And then in terms of our own projections for HP, as we shared last quarter, we have been working to reduce our cost structure to be able to be more competitive. So we expect to have some share gains in the second half, again because of the cost actions that we have been driving during the previous two quarters. So in our performance, you should see that reflected. And again this doesn't mean that we have changed our strategy. Our strategy continues to be profitable growth. It's just that we will be able to sell more units in a profitable way and capture share in this way. Erik Woodring : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe if I just -- if I stay on the printing side, again really strong Print operating margin performance. It was down about 90 basis points sequentially. And I think Print -- as a Print supplies as a percentage of Print mix was up sequentially just given the weak Print hardware trends. So, I deduce that would mean supplies margins were lower sequentially. Can you maybe just unpackage, one, if that's the correct way of thinking about it? And then two, what drove that trend and how is it impacting your view on Print operating margins for the second half of the year? Thanks so much. Tim Brown : Yeah, Erik, this is Tim. I'll maybe take that. From a quarter-on-quarter perspective, you're right, it was down about 0.9. It wasn't so much driven by supplies gross margin rate. We made some additional investments, most notably in variable compensation and that was a bigger driver. Enrique Lores : Margins for the second half? Tim Brown : Oh, I'm sorry, margins for the second half. Yes, from a Print perspective, as I said in the prepared remarks, we expect to be in the upper half of the long-term 16% to 19% range in Q3 and for the full year at the upper-end of that range. I think a couple of the key drivers that you should think about is, one, the 2H sequential improvement we do expect to see in hardware, both from a market and a share perspective. We'll continue to focus on driving operating profit dollars as well through new business models and cost management. And then just to reiterate, as we said before, our forecast for supplies is to decline low to mid-single-digits in constant currency for the full year. And again, from a range perspective, just keep in mind, we provide these for modeling purposes, but we really are trying to drive OP dollars. Erik Woodring : Great. Thank you so much guys. Enrique Lores : Thanks, Erik. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Ng : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. Within Personal Systems, we saw inflections in both consumer and commercial units. You talked a little bit about a recovery that you're seeing in commercial PCs. I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit more on that? Are there any specific verticals where you're seeing that spend improve? Do you think this is an indication of a broader IT spending recovery? And then are there any comments you can make on the slowdown in consumer unit growth? Thank you. Enrique Lores : Sure. So let me start and maybe Tim wants to make a few comments afterwards. So I think you highlighted the key points. We saw for the first time in eight quarters growth in the PC business. And really commercial is the highlight of the quarter that performed even better than we were expecting. It was fairly consistent between North America and Europe and between enterprise and SMB. So probably the key thing is that was not one segment, was across this segment while we continue to see weakness in Asia, especially in China. Probably some of the underlying factors that we have seen, the drivers of this is the need to refresh the installed base as it has been aging and especially as we look at the second half, when we look at the funnel of opportunities that we see that is significantly bigger than what we had last year. And also the fact that we are starting to see some deals driven by Windows 11 Refresh. This is what we are reflecting in the projections that we have for the second half where we expect this momentum to continue. Also on the -- for the second half, we expect the federal business and this is how US focused comment will also improve because during the first half, the business was impacted by the budget discussions and as some of them have been released, we expect the federal business to also be stronger in the second half. Michael Ng : Excellent. Thank you for all that color, Enrique. And then just as a quick follow-up, it was helpful to hear about the inventory increase due to strategic buys. I was just wondering if you could refresh us on your philosophy and strategy around those component purchases. Said differently, how far in advance are you buying some of these components? When would we see more market rate component flow through the P&L? Thank you. Tim Brown : Yeah, sure. This is Tim. I'll take that one. We haven't changed our philosophy or our strategy with respect to strategic buys. We'll continue to kind of evaluate them based on the opportunities that present themselves. And if it makes financial sense for us, we'll take those. I mean, certainly that is something that we try and do and offset from an operational standpoint by making our operational inventory more efficient and utilize that more efficient. So I think that just underscores our commitment to efficient inventory management. And I think as we look forward, we'll continue to do that. Enrique Lores : And there is not a predetermined view in terms of how many months or really looking at the impact they will have in the P&L and our ability to consume those products in a reasonable amount of time. Michael Ng : Great. Thank you, Enrique. Thank you, Tim. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. This is Chen on for Amit. I just had a question on the commentary about AI PCs that you talked about on the call. We're obviously hearing a lot about AI PCs across the supply chain heading into the second half of the year. How are you thinking about the adoption curve of these AI PCs? And really because there hasn't been a killer app introduced yet, how should we think about the mix of AI PCs versus non-AI PCs and your units shipped in the back half of the year? And how should we think about the AI -- the ASP tailwinds from these AI PCs in fiscal '24 and '25? Enrique Lores : Sure. We've seen that the penetration of AI PCs is going to be growing over time. This year, we have products coming both from the first-generation that we announced in January and February and for the next-generation that we just announced a couple of weeks ago. If we look at the total of both, we expect that the -- they will represent around 10% of the shipments for the second half. That's how we are quantifying that. But really, the impact will be more relevant in '25 and in '26. In fact, we expect that AI PCs and at that point will be our new-generation will be between 40% and 60% of our sales three years after launch. That's kind of how we're looking at that. And as we have discussed before, we continue to believe that they will drive an improvement in average selling price of between 5% and 10%. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks for the color. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you so much. Enrique, I was wondering if you could expand a little more on the comment on signs of commercial recovery in PS. I think you said partially driven by adoption of Win 11. How much would you characterize? Have you seen any real traction yet on Win 10 end-of-life support driven strength or perhaps if you could characterize it even from a COVID refresh perspective or anything else, any color there would be helpful. And I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Sure. As you know, Wamsi, this was one of the assumptions that we had at the beginning of the year that Windows 11 Refresh would be impacting the results on the second half. And we are starting to see that, not so much on the numbers for Q2, but yes, in the funnel that we are starting to see and the opportunities that many of our large enterprise customers are starting to bring us. It's clearly starting to happen. During Q2, Microsoft published dates and cost to support the previous operating systems and this always creates an acceleration of the process and this is what we have started to see. In parallel to that, as you mentioned, clearly, the installed base has been aging during the last two, three years and we think this is also impacting the strength that we are starting to see on the commercial side. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thanks, Enrique. As a follow-up, I was wondering if you could touch a little bit on the seasonality? I think you said you're expecting in PS revenue up high-single-digit, slightly below typical seasonality and then continuing to grow into Q4. Just wondering maybe if you could put that in perspective of maybe second half versus first half, how that might compare to a typical year seasonality half versus half? And just on the margin side, clearly very impressive margins here and you're on track on your Future Ready program. Would you say that like is there any sense you can give us on how those savings are flowing across PS and Print just so we would understand sort of cost savings and things that you're doing on your Future Ready side versus pricing and mix? Thank you. Enrique Lores : Tim, do you want to take the seasonality one? Tim Brown : Yeah. So, hey, as you said, Wamsi, from a Q3 to Q2, excuse me, Q3 perspective, we do expect to grow sequentially high-single-digits, but slightly below normal seasonality. I think your question is really about the full half. I think you could think about the seasonality be slightly stronger than historical for the full half if you think about Q4 in PCs. Enrique Lores : And basically between Q3 and Q4, traditionally Q4 is a stronger quarter, so as this is how we have built a guide for the second half and the guide for each quarter. And then in terms of savings, Tim? Tim Brown : From a Future Ready savings perspective, we do see the Future Ready across both businesses. I don't know that it's more pronounced in one versus the other. We're definitely focused from a core perspective where we're driving some of those efficiencies. I think the important thing to note about the Future Ready savings is it does help us deliver our margin rates even in a challenging demand environment. It is allowing us to reinvest in some key growth areas in key areas such as AI and our people. I'll leave it at that. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thank you so much. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ananda Baruah : Hey, yeah. Thanks a lot. Hey guys. Good afternoon. Appreciate you guys taking the question. I guess let's, well, yeah, just sticking with PCs, what's a good way to think, Enrique and Tim about, I guess, kind of margin as you go through the Refresh cycle given that it sounds like you think Gen AI PCs are going to -- and AI PCs are going to be a sort of disproportionate amount of the mix? And then just a quick follow-up also. Thanks. Enrique Lores : Well, from a margin perspective, Ananda, we are not changing the guidelines that we have provided in the past. We expect the PC business to stay in the 5% to 7% range. And Tim mentioned where we expect this to be for the second half. On the -- and this is I think what at this point is the projection that we have. We have multiple variables, ups and downs, but this is our view at this point. Ananda Baruah : Cool. And just a quick follow-up is have you guys, I'm just interested in if you have any thoughts yet, Enrique, on battery -- battery power, battery capacity, battery life over the next, let's say, 36 months. As GenAI PCs start to make their way into the world, the battery drain that comes with the use of GenAI capability, any thoughts there on battery? And that's it for me. Thanks guys. Enrique Lores : Sure. Let me make two comments. First of all, we -- in the next-generation AI PCs that we introduced a couple of weeks ago, actually battery life is one of the key differentiators. In fact, battery life is over 30 hours and this is driven by the fact that both we are using ARM technology in the PCs, which is more efficient from a cost perspective, but also because one of the enablers of AI PCs is that we are building in our PCs large language models that optimize the utilization of the PC based on how each user is going to be using that. What this means is the PC will learn what applications we are using, what applications we are not using and how to optimize consumption based on that. There is really a personnel device based on your own utilization, which over time is also going to have a significant impact on battery savings, not only on ARM products, but also on x86 products is one of the big differentiators of AI PCs. Ananda Baruah : That's a lot of great context. Super helpful. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Enrique. Enrique Lores : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for the questions. I guess, if I can just start, Enrique, you had in your prepared remarks just in terms of the outlook or what you're seeing in the China markets looks overall from the momentum perspective that overall demand is not strong in that market. We've seen some of the more, I guess, macro data come out a bit more positive in recent weeks. Anything more you can share in terms of how you're thinking about the geography sort of that particular region progressing through the rest of the year? Are things getting a bit better or do you see further downside from where things are in terms of demand? Any more recent sort of commentary that you can see in terms of your order trends there? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you. Enrique Lores : Yeah. So we didn't see an improvement of demand in the second quarter, not for Print, nor for Personal Systems. And then we haven't built any improvement in our projections for the second half. We think that the economic situation will continue to be challenged and this is what we are building in our plan and this applies to China. In other geographies, we are seeing great momentum, great progress, for example, in India, and this has been a very positive market for us in the last quarter. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. Great. And on the poly business specifically, I mean, it seems like overall demand trends are starting to improve, but when you think about sort of overall enterprises and their willingness to go back and spend on video collaboration again, what you're seeing in relation to sort of reengaging in terms of making that a priority in relation to their office space and investments in their office space? Thank you. Enrique Lores : Yeah, thank you. On the overall hybrid systems business, which is how we call it, we continue to see from one side the demand has been limited. And as you said, enterprises have been limiting their investment. At the same time, quarter-on-quarter, we started to see some momentum and we expect it to continue in the second half. And this was especially true in video conferencing systems. From a long-term perspective, we continue to believe that this is a -- that this is going to be a growth opportunity for us. We think that the flexibility that the hybrid world means brings is important for companies and is important for employees. And therefore, this opportunity is going to continue to be very real in the years to come. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. I just had a couple of quick clarifications and then a question. Just to clarify, you sound very constructive on the recovery in PCs and some further tailwind from AI PC. So I'm a little surprised you're actually guiding below normal seasonal for Q3. Can you explain why that is? And also just on the buybacks, the buybacks are only $100 million this quarter, quite a bit lower than first quarter. Again, could you just clarify? And I have a follow-up, please. Enrique Lores : Sure. Let me take the question on PCs. We are -- we saw strength on the commercial side in Q2 and we are projecting that in the second half. At the same time, we're more cautious on the demand side on consumer and we are also projecting that to continue in the second half. And this is what has some impact from a seasonality perspective, because as you know, from a seasonality perspective, consumer has a stronger seasonality in the second half and this is why we're being a bit more conservative in our assumptions for the second half. In terms of share buybacks, probably the most important comment to make is we have not changed our approach. Our goal continues to be to return 100% of free cash flow to investors unless we identify better ROI opportunities. And while our leverage stays below two, an investor should expect that we will continue to return 100% of free cash flow over time. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. Thank you. And just if I could zoom out and just try and level set, like I think revenue this year and last year for HP overall is going to be $53 billion to $54 billion. Pre-COVID, the two years, it was about $58 billion. The PC market is going to be about the same level of units this year. I suppose the printing market is down a little bit. But why do you think -- why do you think revenues are still almost 10% below pre-COVID levels? And do you think like there actually should be some snap-back to pre-COVID levels or do you think there's been some share loss over the last few years? How do I reconcile those data points? Thank you. Enrique Lores : Yeah, I think we will have a more detailed conversation about '25 in the coming quarters and what are the projections there. I think you touched on some of the key points. The Print market, both on Print and Office is smaller than it used to be, so this has an impact on size. Also on PCs, even during the last quarter, we have been recovering share. We are still not at the level where we were before the pandemic and our goal is to continue to grow share. So there are multiple factors. And in Q4, when we'll talk about '25, we will give kind of the projections and what we expect to see versus '19 and previous years. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. Enrique Lores : Thank you. I'm looking forward to see you tomorrow, Toni. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Michael Cadiz : Hey, good afternoon. This is Michael Cadiz for Asiya at Citi. Just one question. I know you've given some good points on commercial versus consumer into second half. But through the lens of AI PCs as they gain traction starting in the back half, can you review those comments on commercial versus consumer and how we should look at them through that AI PC view? Enrique Lores : Yes. I think the key thing though is from especially on the next-generation AI PCs, we expect a fairly small impact in the results of the second half. With the products, the products were just launched. We've -- and we will continue to expand the portfolio, but the impact in the second half is going to be fairly small. Of the products we just launched, we expect a stronger traction in consumer because commercial requires some evaluation done by customers that take some time. But over time, we expect the penetration in commercial to grow and to be more relevant in '25 and in '26. Michael Cadiz : Excellent. Thank you. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Steven Chin : Yes, hi. This is Steven calling on behalf of Krish. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one, if I could, I guess, Enrique, could you talk about what percentage of your revenues today are coming from subscription based revenues whether it's Print related or also the newer all-in programs. And kind of do you have like a longer-term view on what that mix could be for next year? And are you also willing to quantify what the operating margins might be for the subscription based revenues versus what you normally sell through the retail and distribution channels? Enrique Lores : Sure. We don't disclose the specific numbers of our subscription business, but let me make a few qualitative comments. First of all, in Q2, we continue to see growth both of net subscribers and also of revenue in the consumer services space that integrates all the subscription models. During the last quarter, we have been expanding our portfolio to first paper and then in Q2 to also include the printer in what we call the all-in model and we keep making good progress in the three subscription programs that we have at this point. Our goal is, of course, to continue to grow this business because both enables us to offer a better value proposition to our customers, but also because allows us to capture more value per customer as the value proposition seems stronger and you can approximate that to profit that we get from customers, so we really think this as a way of building a more accretive business. Steven Chin : Great. Thank you for that. And as my follow-up question, maybe for Tim. I had a question on the balance sheet and specifically inventories as well. I was wondering if there's a major structural change that is going on in terms of inventory dollar levels. If I look at your current revenue run rate and also the current inventory levels, I would have, and comparing to pre-pandemic levels in fiscal '17 where revenue levels were similar to today, your inventory levels are much higher in terms of dollars. I'm just kind of wondering, is this all just due to buy aheads or strategic buys or is there also some element of the change in your current business mix whether it's higher commercial PC mix and also the shift to more subscription model-based revenues, is that having a bigger impact on how much inventory you have to maintain? Thank you. Tim Brown : Yeah. First on the subscription comment, no, that doesn't impact the inventory levels that we're taking. From a structural standpoint, we haven't changed our structural inventory meaningfully. Most of what you see is related to strategic buys and sea shipments as we choose to put those on the ocean. And that has -- that will change over time at times. So there's nothing more than those two things. And what I would say is, the only thing I would add is what I said before is, partially offsetting some of those decisions we make, we are continuing to actually improve our operational inventory to help fund those other items. Steven Chin : Thank you so much. Enrique Lores : Thank you, Tim. Let me thank you everybody for joining the call. As you saw, Q2 was a solid quarter that closes a solid first half of the year. And the more relevant thing is the recovery that we saw in PCs, especially in commercial PCs, which makes us being positive about the second half, where we expect a stronger second half than what we have seen in the first half. And the combination of the progress on the execution side and the growth that we continue to experience in the, what we call the growth businesses, gives us confidence in our ability to continue to create value long-term. So thank you again everybody for joining. I'm looking forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Enrique Lores : Thank you, Orit, and thank you all for joining today's call. Let me start by welcoming our new CFO, Karen Parkhill, who joined HP earlier this month. Her expertise and background are a great addition to our leadership team and we are delighted to have her on board. And a big thank you to Tim Brown for stepping in as Interim CFO over the last three quarters. Today, I will cover our third-quarter results, a few of the new innovative experiences we have introduced, how we are tracking against our strategic priorities, and our expectations for Q4. Karen will provide additional details on our financials and outlook. Starting with our results, let me first focus on revenue. I am pleased to share we are building solid momentum. The company returned to revenue growth for the first time in nine quarters, up 2% year-over-year. This was driven by strong performance in Personal Systems in our key growth areas. Commercial PC recovery was strong, in line with our expectations and a signal of ongoing market stabilization. That said, the recovery of the print market was slower than expected, which impacted print revenue. Non-GAAP operating profit was down 7% and non-GAAP EPS was within our previously provided outlook range, but below our expectations. We have been taking decisive actions to address this. We see an immediate opportunity to drive additional structural cost savings in Q4 as part of our Future Ready program. We are accelerating our plan raising our exit goal for fiscal year 2024. We expect to reach 80% of the three-year structural cost run-rate target by the end of this year. We will also keep executing our plan to strengthen momentum and drive long-term profitable growth. This includes investments in support of our growth businesses. And these combined efforts will help us win in the market, drive profitable growth, and build a stronger HP. Turning to new innovations, Q3 was another strong quarter. We continue to deliver industry-leading experiences by putting our customers at the center of everything we do. In the AI PC category, we are charging ahead. Our next-gen AI PCs are empowering everyone from knowledge workers to data scientists to unlock the power of AI. In May, we launched our first generation using the latest Qualcomm processor. As the world's thinnest next-gen AI PCs with the longest battery life, they are made for mobility. And in July, we introduced a new premium model powered by the latest AMD processor. It is the most powerful AI PC in the industry with up to 55 TOPS of NPU performance. It delivers personalized experiences like real-time translation, personal communication coaching, and quick professional video creation and to help protect against AI-assisted cyber-attacks, the new OmniBook Ultra includes the industry-leading protections and capabilities of HP Wolf Security. We are doing even more to raise the bar for data scientists and AI developers. Our HP AI studio is the world's most comprehensive workstation solution for AI development, in Q3, we made it even stronger by being the first and only to build Gen AI trust into our solution. This means developers can more effectively detect, correct, and monitor inaccurate outputs from AI models, making it faster and safer for companies to deploy AI-powered applications. In Workforce Solutions, our proprietary workforce experience platform is exceeding our expectations. Customers are now leveraging our AI capabilities to manage over 250,000 devices and growing. We also recently added several managed devices wins and deployments, including larger companies like Eaton. Our continued partnership with this global intelligent power management company will help support their IT journey in serving more than 90,000 employees around the world. We set a new standard for industrial printing at DRUPA, introducing advanced digital presses and intelligent automation solutions. This included autonomous mobile robots that save up to two hours of production a day per press. We also enhanced our print OS platform, giving customers the ability to monitor their entire production floor from jobs mission to delivery. We were honored to take home more best of awards than any other exhibitor at the show. We also announced a new partnership with Canva. Their 185 million monthly users can now similarly design and create online and print locally. We also secured major deals with print and digital industry leaders like RR Donnelly, All4Labels and SYNTHES. We are excited about what's ahead. In September, we will host our second annual HP Imagine event. Here, we will unveil even more new experiences that help our customers drive growth and professional fulfillment. In Q3, we further invested in our long-term success. We acquired Cybercore Technologies, a leading provider of secure supply-chain management and cyber solutions for the US Federal Government. The addition of Cybercore to the HP family will help further strengthen our security expertise and enhance our offerings. And just yesterday, we announced we have received a $50 million award from the US Department of Commerce. This funding from the CHIPS and Science Act will help modernize and expand our microfluidics semiconductor fab in Corvallis, Oregon. It will also help us further explore the potential of our microfluidics technology in new areas such as life sciences. In Q3, we released our Annual Sustainable Impact Report, highlighting the important progress we have made. In 2023, our initiatives helped us reach a 27% reduction in value-chain greenhouse gas emissions. We continue to roll-out easily recyclable packaging created from recycled content. In 2023, we've reached a 62% reduction in single-use plastic packaging. And our digital equity efforts have reached 45 million people since 2021. We know there is always more that can be done, but we are proud of our progress. And we are honored to be ranked first in our industry on Time Magazine's World's Most Sustainable Companies list. Now let me share more details on the performance of each of our businesses in the third quarter. In Personal Systems, revenue was up 5% year-over-year, the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Operating profit was 6.4%, in line with our expectations. Globally, our PC share was flat year-over-year, but up 1.3 points quarter-over-quarter. This was driven by growth in high-value categories, including workstations and consumer premium. We continue to see strong progress in key growth areas with revenue up year-over-year in Personal Systems Services and in Hybrid Systems, driven by strong demand for video collaboration. And we grew gaming revenue quarter-over-quarter in line with normal seasonality. We remain very excited about the AI PCs opportunity. Shipments are ramping and initial reactions are overwhelmingly positive. We have a strong portfolio with an unprecedented level of HP engineering. Our growing ecosystem of developers and AI software providers are a huge competitive advantage. Forbes declared HP owns the AI PC crown and they are right. Our focus is on delivering new AI experiences for our customers. Overall, our AI PC expectations across shipments, higher ASPs and premium mix remains on track with our expectations for the second half. Shifting to Print, net revenue was down 3% year-over-year. We delivered print operating profit of 17.3%, which was below our expectations. We saw a softer demand, unfavorable geo mix, and a more aggressive pricing environment. Even in this type of challenging environment, I expect us to do better. And as I said earlier, we are taking actions to accelerate our structural cost-savings for this year. We have made progress on gaining profitable share with growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter in home, and in office when excluding China. We gained share in our strategic areas, especially a big thanks, A3 and A4 value. Key growth areas in print continue to make progress. Consumer services revenue and subscribers grew year-over-year. Industrial graphics did as well and we have strong momentum coming out of DRUPA. And supplies continued to perform as expected., overall, we generated strong free-cash flow of $1.3 billion in the quarter and returned $0.9 billion to shareholders. We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy. Our Board of Directors urged us to increase the total share repurchase authorization to $10 billion. This reaffirms our commitment to deliver strong and sustained capital returns to our shareholders. Looking forward to Q4, we expect the demand environment will remain dynamic and that our markets will continue to be competitive. We expect the PC commercial momentum to continue and our key growth areas to make progress. At the same time, the competitive pricing environment will remain in Q4 and the print market recovery will continue to be slower. As a result, we decided to moderate our expectations for Q4 and the full year. We will maintain investments and progress in high-value and key growth areas and accelerate our cost-reduction plans. We are confident in our strategy and well-equipped to drive meaningful progress as we round out fiscal year 2024. Across our entire portfolio, leveraging AI and enabling hybrid work experiences will remain central to creating solutions that deliver growth and fulfillment for all HP customers. I will pause here and turn it over to Karen. Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Enrique, for the warm welcome. I'm thrilled to join HP, and I'm eager to meet you, our analysts, and investors in the months ahead. Though I've been here just a few weeks, I'm incredibly impressed by the innovation all around me. HP is an iconic company and I'm excited to work with Enrique and our leadership team to create an even stronger future ahead. Building upon our market-leading portfolio, attractive growth businesses, and culture keenly focused on delivering value for our shareholders. Now, on to the quarter. Starting high level, we are building on the progress we made in the first half. And as Enrique said, are pleased with our return to revenue growth for the first time in nine quarters. Solid performance in Personal Systems, which grew for the second quarter in a row and in our key growth areas drove our Q3 revenue growth. And double-digit sequential growth in Personal Systems drove strong free-cash flow in the quarter. We also returned nearly $870 million to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends and remain focused on returning approximately 100% of our free cash flow this fiscal year. Looking across the company, the print market was softer than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. And both print and PS saw a dynamic pricing environment that put some pressure on our margins as did our focus on continuing to invest for long-term sustainable growth. As a result and as Enrique mentioned, we are accelerating our Future Ready plan and intend to deliver savings sooner than expected. As a reminder, our plan incorporated our goal to deliver gross annualized structural cost-savings of $1.6 billion by the end of fiscal year 2025, with approximately 70% or $1.1 billion achieved by the time we exit the fiscal year. Given our focus to mitigate near-term market challenges and just as importantly, maintain investments to drive longer-term growth, we have accelerated our efforts and now expect our cumulative savings target exiting the fiscal year to be approximately $1.3 billion or 80% of the planned target. Now let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was up 2% nominally and up 3% in constant currency. In constant currency, revenue increased in all regions with Americas, EMEA and APJ each growing 3%. Gross margin at 21.5% in the quarter was up slightly year-over-year. Our cost-saving efforts offset both competitive pricing in the face of rising commodity costs and a mix-shift given the strong PS performance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were up year-over-year from continued investment in key initiatives and our people. And of course, we continue to drive cost reductions, including the Future Ready cost-savings. All-in non-GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, down 7% year-over-year. Below the op profit line, non-GAAP net OI&E was down year-over-year, benefiting from less short-term financing activity and lower interest expense from the debt tender we completed last year. Finally, with a diluted share count of roughly 1 billion shares, our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.83, a year-over-year decrease of $0.03 and GAAP-diluted net earnings per share was $0.65. Now let's turn to segment performance. Personal Systems revenue was up 5%, both nominally and in constant currency. With higher commercial volumes and increased ASPs as we worked to adjust pricing where possible to mitigate increased commodity costs. Total units were up 1% year-over-year with strength in commercial. And sequentially, revenue was up 11% and units were up 14% with seasonal strength and overall share gains. Of note, hybrid systems revenue grew in the double-digits year-over-year, including strong growth in video collaboration. Drilling more into the details, consumer revenue was down 1% with units down 6% and commercial revenue was up 8% on 6% unit growth. Improved pricing in consumer, along with a favorable commercial mix and a shift to premium consistent with our strategy drove higher overall ASPs. In fact, we continue to see commercial representing greater than 70% of personal systems revenue. And while calendar Q2 market share was flat year-over-year, we gained share sequentially, driving improvements in high-value categories. And of course, we remain focused on driving profitable revenue and share growth in both our consumer and commercial markets. Personal Systems operating margin of 6.4% was down slightly year-over-year. We had higher commodity costs and purposely continued our strategic investment, offset in part by Future Ready savings. In print, our results reflected the slower pace of market recovery and an incrementally aggressive pricing environment as our Japanese competitors continued to benefit from the weaker yen. Overall, the market came in below expectations, particularly in China. Total print revenue was down 3% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency. And while hardware units declined 2% year-over-year, total print market share increased both year-over-year and sequentially. And momentum in industrial graphics continued with supplies and services driving the fourth straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. By customer segment, commercial revenue decreased 5% with units down 4%. And as mentioned, we felt the impact of market declines, most notably in China and competitive pricing. Consumer revenue returned to growth, increasing 2% on flat units with favorable mix offsetting pricing. Of note, hardware units grew 5% sequentially, driven by strength in consumer and supplies revenue was down 2% nominally and 1% in constant currency, in-line with our outlook. Print operating margin of 17.3% was down year over year with headwinds from pricing and increased investments, not fully offset by savings from our Future Ready actions. On our Future Ready transformation plan, we continue to drive greater effectiveness and efficiency across the company. For example, we're using generative AI capabilities to reduce customer call times in workforce solutions. And in our commercial organization, our move to more end-to-end processes is enabling much faster deal quotes for contractual customers and allowing customers to more easily buy and renew on hp.com. There is more to come as we accelerate and complete this program, particularly in print, where we are driving further reductions across the core, including business consolidation, supply-chain optimization, and reductions in platforms. Now let me move to cash flow and capital allocations. We generated more than $1.4 billion in cash from operations and $1.3 billion in free cash flow. We continued to improve our cash conversion cycle this quarter, driving inventory days down with seasonally higher volumes in Personal Systems, offset in part by an increase in strategic buys as we focused on reducing the near-term impact of rising commodity costs. Lastly, we returned close to $870 million to shareholders through both share repurchase and dividends and finished the quarter within our target leverage range. Just as a reminder, unless higher ROI opportunities arise and as long as our gross leverage ratio remains below two times, we expect to return approximately 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders over time. Looking forward to the fourth quarter and our fiscal year-end, we will continue to navigate a dynamic environment and have therefore modeled multiple scenarios based on several assumptions. In Personal Systems, we expect Q4 revenue to increase sequentially low to mid-single digits. We are expecting continued strength in commercial, but given the lingering softness in the consumer market, we are expecting less seasonal growth than we have seen historically. We anticipate Personal Systems operating margin to remain in the upper half of our long-term target range of 5% to 7% in Q4. As we work to offset increased commodity costs through pricing and disciplined cost management, while continuing to invest in strategic priorities. In print, we see improving trends in the market, but the pace of recovery is slower than we expected with continued competitive pricing pressure. For Q4, we expect print revenue to increase low-to mid-single digits sequentially, driven by typical seasonal strengths as well as strong momentum in our industrial business coming out of DRUPA. We expect supplies revenue in FY 2024 to decline low-single digits. And we anticipate Q4 print margins to be near the top of our 16% to 19% range, given seasonal strength and acceleration of Future Ready cost-savings. Taking all of these considerations into account, we are moderating our guide for Q4 and fiscal year 2024 and we are narrowing our non-GAAP EPS outlook range to $0.01, which is reflected in our updated outlook. We expect fourth-quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.89 to $0.99 and fourth-quarter GAAP-diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.84. For the full-year, we now expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.45. And FY 2024 GAAP-diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.62 to $2.72. Lastly, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.6 billion for FY 2024. As a reminder, our free cash flow outlook includes approximately $300 million of restructuring cash outflows. At this point, we want to open the lines for your questions. But before we do, I want to express my gratitude to my HP colleagues for their help in making my onboarding as smooth as possible. And in particular, I want to thank Tim Brown for his leadership in the interim and his continued help these past few weeks with me. Tim is also on the call with Enrique and me to help answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today will be David Vogt with UBS. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, hi. This is Andrew for David. Wanted to ask about the print margins in fiscal 2024. Can you disaggregate some of the pressure you saw in this quarter? What was the -- what were the primary drivers, what were the bigger drivers? And why do you expect that to reverse next quarter? Is it entirely on the cost cuts from the Future Ready plan or are there other drivers that you're expecting to improve margins in Q4? Thanks. Karen Parkhill : Thanks for your question, Andrew. Our Q3 print margin was below our expectations, although I would note that supplies did come in as expected in the quarter. So our margin was impacted by more aggressive pricing as we talked about, as well as a challenging market environment, particularly in China. And that was driving unfavorable geographic mix. And against that environment, we took the opportunity to place hardware units that are profitable long-term but dilutive to the current overall margin rates. And despite the headwinds, we also maintained our investment in the key growth areas that are going to generate long-term value. And then as we look ahead to Q4, we expect to be seasonally stronger on revenue. We're also, as we talked about taking more aggressive actions to drive that margin improvement. We said we're accelerating our Future Ready plan. We're driving further reductions across the core. That includes business consolidation, reduction in platforms, and supply-chain optimization. And with all of this taken together, we're confident in our ability to deliver the print margins near the top-end of our 16% to 19% target range. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. And I have a couple, if I can just start with maybe AI PCs, which you referred to in terms of the momentum you're seeing with the customers and the launches that you've done. If you can share how you're seeing that flow-through when you look at the segments between consumer PS and commercial, what are you seeing in terms of activity there? Where do you expect it will make a more material impact in the coming quarters? And how do you sort of see that feeding into maybe a bit of the recovery on the consumer PS side as well? Any thoughts on that would be appreciated. And I have a follow-up. Thank you. Enrique Lores : Sure. Thank you. Let me take that question. So first of all, when we talk about consumer AI PCs, if we use the IDC description, we had said that we expected sales to be around 10% during the second half and we think we're going to be slightly above that number. So they are performing well. Where we really are also focused in what we call next-generation AI PCs that we have just started to launch. We announced our first products with Qualcomm and with AMD only a few weeks ago and shipments are starting to -- are beginning now. So we haven't seen a significant impact from those yet. The reaction has been positive. The experiences that we are able to generate are very compelling. We had an event with many of our software providers a few weeks ago in New York when we were able to display that. So the reaction is positive, but the impact on our results has been very, very small yet. In terms of adoption, we think that in the very short term, adoption in consumer will be faster because adoption in commercial is always limited by the evaluation process that many of our customers have to go through and those evaluation processes are only starting. So it's going to take some time until they have an impact in our results. And in terms of the projections that we have for the future, we maintain the projections that we have been sharing over the last quarters. We expect next-generation AI PCs to represent around 50% of shipments in 2027, three years after launch, and they drive an average selling price increase between 5% and 10%. This has been the projections we have been sharing before and we are confident that we will continue -- we will deliver on those in the future. Samik Chatterjee : Got it, got it. Thanks for that. And if for my follow-up, I can just ask you on the print business. I understand the sort of headwinds and the competitive landscape that you're calling out, but how should we think about what's the sort of what are you seeing in terms of market-share play-out, particularly as the competitive landscape sounds like it's tougher, would you sort of look at it from a market-share perspective and say the Japanese competitors are more competitive and you're giving up some share in certain segments? Or do you think it's more just the underlying market that's a challenge here relative to market share? Thank you. Enrique Lores : Okay. Let me take this opportunity to share a bit more about what we are seeing on the print market and then how do we project this going forward. As we said in the prepared remarks, clearly the print market was challenged and we didn't see the recovery that we were expecting. But within that, we saw some signs of positive change. For example, we saw positive growth on the home space. The decline in the office category was lower than the declines we had seen in previous quarters. And as Karen said before, we have seen supplies performing as expected and especially usage is a good predictor of what is going to be happening in the future. This is why we think that the slow -- slower recovery is temporary and we expect it to see changing going forward. The majority of it was in the office space and this is really what drove it from a demand perspective. From a pricing perspective, what we have seen is a continuation of what we have shared before. Many of our competitors are taking advantage of the weak yen and this is allowing them to be more cost -- more aggressive from a price perspective. We have been working to reduce the cost structure for our products to be able to place profitable units. And this is what we did this quarter. We placed units, we hold our share. We grew share in the home space. And as we continue to drive cost, we will continue -- if we see the opportunity, we will continue to place profitable units, which continues to be our goal. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Erik Woodring : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Maybe Enrique, for you something that you didn't necessarily allude to in-depth in your prepared remarks on the PC side was the kind of commercial/enterprise recovery that we've been talking about for a few quarters. So, can you maybe one, just help us understand as you look at commercial -- excuse me, consumer versus SMB versus large enterprises, kind of, how you would characterize PC demand across each of those end-markets? And second to that, how does that influence your view that whether there is or is not a large commercial refresh cycle still in front of us or is that behind us? Would just love to know where you think we are in that phase? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Enrique Lores : Sure. So, let me go there. But we -- I think what the market evolution on our results confirm is that we have seen a recovery of the PC market. And this recovery is mostly driven by the commercial side of the business. Trying to provide some more specifics on -- about your question, we saw market for enterprise growing close to 5%, government between 6% and 7%, SMB 3% and education 1%. So, we saw significant growth on the commercial space, especially in enterprise. And this is really supported by the trends that we had discussed before. The installed base has been aging and the companies are seeing the need to refresh that. Windows 11 is starting to have an impact and especially since Microsoft announced the -- when they will stop supporting Windows 10, and it's not only we have seen in sales, we continue to see that in the funnel of new opportunities that we see that continues to grow and it is much stronger this year than it was last year. So we think that the refresh is still ahead of us. We have only started to see that and we continue to believe that this opportunity is coming. Erik Woodring : Thank you. That was really helpful, Enrique. Maybe, Karen, if first, nice to meet you looking forward to working together. It's great that you guys are accelerating some of these cost-saving initiatives this year. If I just look year to date revenue through the first three quarters, revenue was down about $400 million year-over-year. OpEx is up about $300 million year-over-year. So can you just help me understand how much of these cost-savings as we look forward you want to flow through to the bottom line versus it seems you are more prone maybe to make investments for longer-term growth? Can you just help me understand how with this new view on your cost-savings, how you expect to balance that drop-through versus reinvestment? Thank you. Karen Parkhill : Yeah, thanks for the question, Erik, and I look forward to meeting you in person too. In terms of flow-through, our savings are flowing through and reflected really in our ability to deliver the margins within or above our target ranges for both PS and print despite the fact that we've got this challenging macro backdrop. Just a reminder, our savings are reflected in both OpEx and COGS. And as -- and we are reinvesting. And so as we reinvest, we're seeing a bit of a geography shift in our P&L with some higher gross profit offset by higher operating expenses because much of our investments are going to be in the OpEx area. And we've talked about the fact that we're focused on driving these savings so that we can both offset our headwinds and continue to invest in our important growth drivers for the future and you can expect that to continue. Erik Woodring : Thanks so much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. Thank you. Hello, Enrique, and welcome, Karen. I have two questions as well. First, just for the full year, I think one of your objectives was to grow revenues for the full year. Do you still expect that to be the case? And if I could just follow up on the last question. If I look at what your guidance is implying for this year, revenues are close to flat, and operating profit dollars are expected to be close to flat despite reaching $1.3 billion in run-rate savings. So, should we be thinking of Future Ready as really just providing air cover to make investments rather than structurally changing your profit profile, because certainly, the 2024 results don't really seem to suggest that there's any expected overall improvement in operating profit despite the cost cutting? And I have a follow-up, please. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks for your question, Toni. And as we look-ahead in Q4, we are expecting some seasonal growth ahead. Personal Systems, we expect to increase sequentially low-to mid-single digits. And we said given the lingering softness in consumer, we're expecting some less seasonal growth than we've had historically. And for print, obviously, we've got improving trends in the market, but the pace is slower than we initially expected and we've got some continued pricing pressure. So, we expect print revenue to increase low-to mid-single digit and that's driven by typical seasonal strength along with some seasonality coming out of industrial with DRUPA. And obviously, we expect supplies to increase sequentially in line with last year. I would say on the Future Ready, we are focused on driving savings to offset our headwinds and ensure that we can maintain our investments. And what you saw this quarter was us having some headwinds hit us, taking some action that's going to help us more in the quarter ahead than it did in this quarter and purposely continuing our investment because we're focused on the longer-term. Enrique Lores : I think, Toni what is important also, if we look at year-to-date operating profit growth for the different businesses versus the plan that we had at the beginning of the year, we have seen operating profit growth in Personal Systems and this is a combination of both the savings and the progress that we have seen in the market. We have not seen operating profit growth in print and we -- this was -- this is not what we were expecting at the beginning of the year. But this is the major change that we have seen. And the major driver for that is the smaller market that we see, especially in-office, and the more aggressiveness that we see especially driven by the weakness in yen. We think both things are temporary. So we don't see this as structural changes, but definitely they are impacting our performance in 2024. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you for that. And just a follow-up, Karen, I would imagine that capital allocation is probably one of the biggest decisions that you need to think about as a new CFO. I saw the increase in authorization to $10 billion. I think last time HP increased the authorization in February 2020 was actually $15 billion. A, should we read anything into that? And Karen, as the new CFO, what -- do you have a firm opinion yet on what capital return should be on an ongoing basis and whether 100% is really the right thing for the business over the next three to five years? Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks for the questions, Toni. First of all, I would say, don't read anything into the new authorization. We did have a $15 billion authorization that we are near expiration and pleased that the Board increased the authorization to $10 billion at this stage. And it shows our commitment to continuing to return roughly 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. I think that is the right commitment for our shareholders at this stage. We're not changing any of that commitment longer-term. We are still committed to that capital allocation policy of returning 100%. And of course, we said unless higher ROI opportunities arise and as long as our gross leverage remains below two times. But what you've seen is that is really returning roughly 100%, and we're committed to that this year too. Enrique Lores : Let me emphasize that, Toni, nobody should read anything on the number. $10 billion is close to a third of our market cap. It's a very big number and this is going to take us several years to get there. So no, nothing important behind the number except our commitment to continue to do it. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you so much. Two for me as well. First, if you just look over the last three quarters and it's kind of been asked in different ways, but I just thought I'd asked it a little differently here. If you look at the last three quarters, you've shown revenue overall company-level revenue acceleration. But in the same timeframe, you've also seen EPS growth deceleration and decline this last reported quarter. But are you hitting some type of inflection where the cost-savings impact is no longer able to offset arguably where you've been operating in terms of maybe unsustainably high print margins this year? And as we carry the thought process into next year, does it really mean that given some of the efforts that Karen alluded to in terms of acceleration of cost-savings into this year, that there was incremental flow-through into next year? And can we see revenue and EPS growth be in sync or is there something more structural that's kind of causing this dislocation? And I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Yes, we don't think there is anything structural. I think it's more the result of what we see from a competitive perspective. And I will go back to some of the data I was sharing with Toni before. Year-to-date, Print PCs are growing operating profit. We are not seeing that growth in print and this is really driven by the softness that we see on the office space and the aggressive pricing that we see because of the weakness of yen. On the positive side, we have seen the home business recovering and probably more important than that is the fact that supplies and our supplies business is performing as we were expecting. So really no changes in supplies. And always supplies is a good indicator of what we would expect to see in the print side going forward because it talks about the usage that our customers are using and how really our devices and the printers are being utilized. If you look at the guide and the midpoint of the guide, we expect EPS to grow this year. So from that perspective, we expect growth. But yes, it's slightly lower than we were expecting because of the competitive environment that we are facing, especially in print, Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thanks, Enrique. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Wamsi Mohan : And Karen, I look forward to working with you. I guess if I could just follow up on this on the free cash flow. When you look at sort of the lower -- coming in at the lower end of the EPS range, your free cash flow range has been unchanged. You also called out some acceleration of the Future Ready program. So should we take that there is no incremental cash impact because of Future Ready program in this fiscal year? And should we think also that despite that wider range, you're more likely to come in at the lower end of that free cash flow range as well? Or are there other puts and takes that would maybe drive it higher than that? Thank you. Karen Parkhill : Thanks, Wamsi. I would just start with, we're pleased with our free-cash flow this quarter. It did come in better-than-expected and it really reflects the strength of the sequential growth in PS that drives working capital improvements. And remember that our PS cash conversion cycle is negative. And so, we're going to continue to expect projected sequential PS revenue improvement and you can expect that to contribute to Q4 free-cash flow as well. So, our outlook remains unchanged to deliver $3.1 billion to $3.6 billion for the full year, we're confident in our ability to deliver the remainder that we've got in Q4. And keep in mind that our free cash flow is stronger in the back half. And so we just expect that strength to continue. Tim Brown : I think it's also important to put in context the change of overall guide for the year. We are talking about $0.05, which represents $60 million, $70 million. So you put that in the context of the cash-flow guide, you will see that the impact of the small change that we are driving is really small. Enrique Lores : Yes. Just related to the future-ready, I don't know if this is part of your question,, but the cash outlays for Future Ready expect to be roughly the same as we've been saying about $300 million. Wamsi Mohan : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Michael Ng : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I was just wondering if you could expand around some of the comments you made around placing more hardware at print, potentially at the expense of margins. And could you talk a little bit more about the strategy there? And then maybe you can just update us on some of the print KPIs what's the current percentage of revenue that's profit upfront? And what are some of the latest figures on the Instant Ink or other plans like all-in-a-hardware subscription today? Thank you. Enrique Lores : Yes, thank you. So when -- let's see, first of all, our strategy has not changed and it continued to be placed profitable units. And as we had said before, we were expecting to be able to be more aggressive in the second half as we were driving cost reductions at the hardware level and this is what we did. And this is why at the overall print level, we grew market share this quarter, and especially in the home space and also in A3 and in A4 value. So this is what drove our ability to place more units and to gain some share, even if the environment was more competitive than what we were expecting. We continue to make good progress in driving the business model changes that we have been sharing before. Instant Ink revenue continues to grow. Net subscribers continue to grow. The number of subscribers in the all-in program continues to grow. So, we continue to make very good progress on that front. And also we continue to be in the 50% range of profit on front units similar to what we have shared before. So good performance in that level and nothing relevant to share in those areas. Michael Ng : Great. Thanks. And if I could just follow up on the Personal Systems revenue seasonality up low-to-mid sequentially. I appreciate there are some lingering headwinds in Consumer. Is something getting worse sequentially? And is some of that consumer weakness concentrated in certain regions or industry verticals? Thank you. Enrique Lores : No, I think it's a consequence of the softness that we see. And this really is when we compare to previous quarters, we think that Q4 is going to be a stronger quarter than Q3 from a consumer PC perspective. But we think that the growth is going to be lower than what we had seen in previous years, given that we expect to see this softness in consumer, nothing else behind that this assumption. Michael Ng : Thank you, Enrique. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Irvin Liu : Hi, thank you for the question. This is Irvin Liu on for Amit. I have one and a follow-up. So, on the personal systems side, can you just give us a sense on how durable your recent price increases are? Understandably, some of this was commodity-driven, but in the event that we see some of these commodity prices stabilize, how do you think about your ability to maintain your ASPs? Enrique Lores : I would say we are still in the process of adjusting our prices up, as I have shared in previous calls, we cannot adjust prices immediately because there are contracts that have been signed or deals that have been done. So it takes us some time to adjust. And also this quarter, given the competitive environment that we are seeing, probably we are not able to adjust them as much as we wanted, but you should expect us that we will continue to do that in the coming quarters. If we look at the PC business, from a historical perspective, we are always able to adjust prices, but it takes some time until we fully adjust them based on all the drivers that I mentioned before. Irvin Liu : Got it. Thank you. For my second question, I was hoping you can provide us an update on what you're seeing in the Federal Government customer vertical. I think during the first half of the year, budget discussions did weigh on your business a little bit. But with that sort of in the rearview mirror, how has your federal business trended? And how should we think about budget flush dynamics through the balance of the year? Enrique Lores : Yes. I mentioned that slightly before, when I talked about government, the Federal Government is part of that and it was actually the segment where we saw the strongest growth this quarter, it grew between 6% and 7% and we think that -- we think that this is going to continue in the second-half. It will be a source of growth in the commercial -- in the commercial space. And for example, we signed a deal -- we have been signing deals with many of the large businesses. We signed one with NASA that we are especially proud of because it was a big replacement and a great mix of both workstations and notebooks. So very good deals and very good funnel in this space. Irvin Liu : Thanks for the color. Enrique Lores : Thank you. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Steven Chin : Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. This is Steven calling on behalf of Krish. Enrique, the first question for you regarding personal systems and the commercial refresh cycle. With the Windows 10 end-of-life schedule to occur in about a year from now or four quarters, I was wondering just based on historic patterns whenever certain Windows is in its end of life, any thoughts on how the refresh cycle might look from a quarterly basis? Do you expect fairly steady purchases from now until to next year? Or is there sort of like a stronger ramp-up towards that deadline? And also related, do you think, I guess the ramp volumes of Intel's new Lunar Lake if customers might be waiting for that in conjunction with the replacements? Enrique Lores : Sure. Let me let me go through both. So first of all, the majority of the refresh is still ahead of us. If we compare to previous cycles, it has probably started in a slightly slower way, but we are clearly picking-up momentum. And when we look at the funnel of opportunities that we have and the growth of the funnel compared to where we were a few quarters ago is definitely growing and definitely supporting the opportunity that we see. And in terms of customers waiting for the Intel refresh, this is not something that we are seeing the opposite. We are starting to see good momentum in commercial as the results this quarter reflect and the projections that we have shared for Q4 and for the coming quarters. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call-back over to Enrique Lores for any closing remarks. Enrique Lores : So, let me just start by -- close by saying thank you to all for having joined today. A big welcome to Karen to the business and to the team. A big thank you to team for the great work that they have done over the last quarters. And going back to the business, I think Q3 confirms the momentum that we have. We are pleased to see the company growing again after nine quarters. So I think that's a great change. And we also know that the competitive environment continues to be difficult, especially in print, especially in office and that -- and we are accelerating our cost actions to compensate for that, but we remain very confident in the long-term opportunity that the company has, especially integrating AI into our portfolio and redefining the future of work. This is where the company is focused and this is where we are really investing to continue to have profitable growth in the future. But thank everybody and looking forward to seeing all of you in the coming weeks. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Enrique Lores : Thank you, Orit, and thank you all for joining today's call. Today, we will cover our Q4 performance and 2024 full year results. We will also discuss expectations for the year ahead and how we are sharpening our strategic focus to lead the future of work. Let's start with our Q4 results. For the second consecutive quarter, revenue was up 2% year-over-year. Both Personal Systems and Print demonstrated steady progress. In Personal Systems, commercial units and share gains were strong contributors to revenue growth. In Print, we drove revenue growth for the first time in fiscal year 2021. Our growth businesses also performed well, significantly contributing to our growth in the quarter.Non-GAAP EPS grew 3% to $0.93 in line with outlook. We accelerated our future ready structural cost-saving plans, while continuing to invest in our growth businesses. In short, we did what we said we would do. Q4 also capped off an exceptional year of innovation. At our annual HP Imagine event in September, we showcased breakthrough experiences and platforms with new AI powered capabilities. Our expanded AI, PC portfolio is now equipped with HP AI Companion, a bespoke application. The app uses generative AI to help analyze private files, create content or respond quickly to key tasks. Through partnerships with our growing number of software companies, we are bringing to life even more experiences for our customers. For example, we are collaborating with Zoom to power AI Companion with on-device capabilities that can streamline meeting preparation, quickly locate relevant documents and automating key tasks based on in meeting decisions. These types of experiences illustrate how powerful next gen AI compute will be in the workforce. We also launched HP Boost, a solution that allows data scientists and AI developers to share GPUs remotely. And we continue to enhance our workforce experience platform, adding the ability to monitor and manage printers and integrating popular business applications from Microsoft and ServiceNow. Our recent acquisition of Vyopta, a provider of collaboration management solutions will strengthen the platform. It will offer customers comprehensive control over their digital ecosystems from a single dashboard. In the AI PC category, we continue to lead with performance and security. We are delivering powerful experiences, industry-leading battery life and flexible form factors. Building on our consumer launches last quarter, we introduced the most powerful next-gen AI business notebook. The EliteBook X is ideal for tech experts and business consultants who run large applications for analysis. It is powered by an industry-leading 55 TOPS of NPU performance. At the same time, it offers AI enhanced protection to secure the most sensitive data. Freelancers and creators can also power their work with the Omnibook Ultra Flip, our first 2-in-1 AI PC. With it, they have the ability to design with AI, whether sketching, editing or collaborating. And with the power of HP Wolf Security, they can keep data secure and protected. Beyond the PC, we showed how we are making printing smarter with HP Print AI. It is the industry's first AI-powered intelligent print experience that simplifies and enhances printing. The perfect output feature uses AI to deliver the perfect print, solving universal frustrations like spreadsheet and tables printing over multiple pages. Our innovations this quarter underscore our commitment to delivering impactful customer driven solutions to define the future of work. Before I continue, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the incredible teams across HP delivering these experiences. Your commitment to innovate for our customers, partners and the planet is inspiring. Let me now turn to business unit performance. For the third consecutive quarter, revenue in Personal Systems was up year-over-year with 2% growth driven by strength in commercial. We saw continued pressure on commodity cost, which impacted operating profit. And we will continue to take actions on pricing and cost to mitigate this over time. We saw gains in worldwide PC market share year-over-year, particularly in high value categories, including commercial and consumer premium. We believe, there is more opportunity here and we will continue to prioritize these categories. AI PC units this quarter were more than 15% of our shipments. In fact, as recently published by Canalys, we have the number one market share of AI PC in the Windows ecosystem, and we intend to maintain this position. Looking ahead, the power of AI coupled with the strength of our portfolio will enable us to deliver new levels of efficiency and security critical to the future of work. We expect AI PC penetration to continue to further strengthen our commercial leadership. And since the Windows 11 refresh has ramped lower than previous industry transitions, we expect to see the impact of the upgrade to be more pronounced in 2025. In the growth areas, hybrid systems and PS services delivered strong performance with revenue up year-over-year. And we grew gaming revenue quarter-over-quarter, in line with normal seasonality. Turning to Print, revenue grew 1% year-over-year. The increase was fueled by strong performance in supplies and industrial graphics, offset in part by a competitive pricing environment. In both home and office, we gained share year-over-year. In home, we continue to gain share across all categories, especially in big tanks. And we delivered on our commitment to regain share in office. In growth areas, consumer services and industrial performed strongly with revenue growth year-over-year. We believe sustainability is core to our long-term growth and we continue to operate with a sense of purpose and intentionality. For example, in Q4, our HP Renew Solutions team received industry recognition for making it easier for customers to purchase high-performing refurbished hardware. We were also recognized on Newsweek's World\u2019s Most Trustworthy Companies list. Let me now talk about the full-year performance. Revenue was flat year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS grew 3%. While the market recovery was slow, especially in the first half. We had a strong second half recovery with positive momentum going into the new fiscal year. We are pleased with our key growth areas, which collectively grew faster than the rest of the portfolio and drove approximately 20% of our total company revenue for the year. We generated strong free cash flow aligned with our annual guidance. We returned nearly 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in line with our long-term commitment. Over the past year, we have continued to drive solid progress with our future ready strategy. We said we would invest in innovation, focusing our portfolio on growth and integrating new AI capabilities and we have done that. We have successfully implemented new business models as we shifted more offerings to subscriptions and solutions, increasing value per customer. We told you we were continuing to improve our operational capability. Here we have taken steps to ensure a more resilient supply chain, improve our order-to-delivery time and reduce customer call time using AI. Overall, fiscal year 2024 was a year of steady progress. We know our plans are working and we are well-positioned to capitalize on new opportunities that drive sustained growth. We are looking ahead with a clear focus on leading the future of work. With the proliferation of AI and flexible work, customer expectations have continued to evolve. Employers want to drive growth, while employees are seeking professional fulfillment. At this intersection, it's an attractive opportunity for HP. With our powerful portfolio of solutions and the right team in place, we believe we have what it takes to lead the next era. Here is how. First, we are investing and innovating aggressively in new AI-powered capabilities and software. We will focus on delivering a cutting-edge AI-powered tech stack. This is an exciting shift for our customers everywhere. It will provide them with new insights and automation, personalized experiences and foster team collaboration. Our recently established Technology and Innovation Organization, TIO brings together all our software resources into a single team. The TIO will accelerate our move from a transactional hardware company to a more experienced-led organization. Second, we are leveraging the power of our portfolio to capture growth opportunities in commercial and solution. Commercial segments are growing faster than consumer segments and we are prioritizing accordingly. In Personal Systems, for example, commercial TAM is expected to grow 3x faster than consumer. And in print, contractual office and industrial TAM are expected to perform better than consumer and transactional office. Thirdly, we are maintaining our focus on capturing profitable growth in premium consumer and gaming. For example, we are taking measures to increase growth in consumer services, building on the success of programs like our HP all in subscription plans. And in operations, we will continue to evolve our supply chain capabilities to support our future of work strategy, while ensuring supply chain resiliency, end-to-end process automation and continuous improvement in our cost structure. Looking forward to fiscal year '25, we assume that the PC market will grow faster than in fiscal year '24, fueled by multiple catalysts for refresh, including AI. And we expect the print market to decline low single-digits. We expect revenue for both Personal Systems and print to perform at least in line with the respective market. We have significant opportunities to accelerate in our key growth areas, especially in commercial, where the market is growing faster than consumer. We also remain committed to returning approximately 100% of free cash flow over time, unless opportunities with a higher return on investment arise and as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x EBITDA. We are confident our strategic focus and operational capabilities will enable us to deliver solid growth in fiscal year '25 across revenue, non-GAAP earnings and EPS and free cash flow. I will pause here and turn it over to Karen. Karen Parkhill : Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid financial results in Q4 with growth across both Personal Systems and print, driving a year-over-year increase in revenue for the second quarter in a row. We grew non-GAAP EPS year-over-year and delivered strong free cash flow in the quarter, solidly within our full year guidance range. And as committed, we returned nearly 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders for the full fiscal year. Taking a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was up 2% nominally and in constant currency. In fact, we grew in constant currency across all regions with Americas and EMEA growing 2% and APJ growing 3%. Gross margin was 21.4%, flat year-over-year, as we offset rising commodity costs with pricing and cost actions. Non-GAAP operating expenses reflect continued investment in key strategic initiatives, offset in part by cost reductions, including the acceleration of Future Ready cost savings. All in, non-GAAP operating profit was $1.2 billion in line with our expectations. Below the op profit line, non-GAAP net OI&E was down year-over-year with lower currency-related losses and reduced levels of short-term financing activity. Finally, with a diluted share count of approximately 970 million shares, our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.93 a year-over-year increase of $0.03. Now let's turn to segment performance. Personal Systems revenue was up 2% nominally and 3% in constant currency with higher commercial volumes and increased ASPs, as we continue to adjust pricing where possible to mitigate increased component costs. We outperformed the market in commercial with total units up 1% year-over-year, and we continue to see progress in key growth areas, particularly in hybrid systems that delivered strong growth for the second straight quarter. Drilling more into the details, commercial revenue was up 5% on 4% unit growth with improved pricing and favorable mix. We increased our market share with gains in high-value commercial premium. In fact, our gains in commercial more than offset continued market softness in consumer, where revenue was down 4% with units down 3%, particularly in China and as expected. Our PS operating margins were a little lower than expected, reflecting the headwinds from higher commodity costs and continued investment in strategic initiatives. Not fully offset by repricing efforts and future-ready savings. In print, our results reflected our focus on execution in a market that is showing signs of stabilization. Total print revenue increased 1% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency, driven by supplies and key growth areas. Momentum in industrial graphics continued with growth in hardware, supplies, and services. We also saw double-digit growth in consumer subscriptions revenue. By customer segment, consumer grew 3% year-over-year on 10% unit growth, with share gains across all categories. In commercial, while revenue declined 1% in a competitive pricing environment, units increased 9% with share gains across all markets except China, as we purposely focused on profitable long-term unit growth. Print operating margin of 19.6% was not only up year-over-year but above the high end of our range with favorable mix and savings from our accelerated future ready cost actions.Looking holistically at our future ready cost plans, we are pleased with the progress we made in the quarter to accelerate our actions and at this point are ahead of the plans we initially laid out. In fact, with one year to go on our three year plan, we have driven roughly 80% of our total program goal of $1.6 billion of annualized gross run rate savings. As part of Future Ready, we have modernized our data infrastructure across the company, reduced platforms and Personal Systems by over 1/3, allowing for reduced commodity complexity and driven further portfolio and resource reductions across core print. We look forward to completing these plans to drive further effectiveness and efficiency across the company in the next year. Now, let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated more than $1.6 billion in cash from operations and $1.5 billion in free cash flow and free cash flow for the fiscal year was $3.3 billion, solidly within the guidance range we set at the beginning of the year. We continue to improve our cash conversion cycle this quarter, driving days payable up as a result of improving payment terms and higher manufacturing activity, and inventory days down with lower strategic buy activity. Lastly, we returned approximately $1.2 billion to shareholders through both share repurchase and dividends and finished the quarter within our target leverage range. For the year, we returned close to $3.2 billion to shareholders, nearly 100% of our free cash flow. Our Q4 and FY'24 results reflect the consistent progress we are making to drive profitable growth and maintain our leadership position in a steadily improving market. And we intend to continue this momentum into next year, as we drive further growth and investment in strategic areas, including the future of work. As we look ahead in FY'25, let me start with our segments. In Personal Systems, as Enrique said, we are aligned with industry experts, projecting the PC market to increase mid-single-digits in 2025 with the commercial market growing faster than consumer. We expect our fiscal year '25 revenue to grow at least in line with the market and to be stronger in the second half of the year, driven by normal seasonality, timing of the Windows 11 refresh and increased penetration of AI PCs. At this point, we anticipate AI PCs will make up approximately 25% of our PC unit shipments in FY'25. On operating margins, we expect to be in the upper half of our 5% to 7% range for the year, but to remain in the lower half in Q1, given continued pressure on our commodity costs. And while we have put in place cost reduction and pricing actions to offset these pressures, they will take time and will ramp through the year, leading to stronger margins expected in the second half. In Print, we expect to perform at least in line with the overall market. And as Enrique said, we are aligned with industry experts projecting the overall market to decrease low single-digits in 2025. We expect the pricing environment to stabilize and our ASPs to benefit from our focus on driving profitable share gains in strategic categories. Particularly in office, we see the opportunity to capture share in the contractual segment, where we are under indexed. We expect supplies revenue to decline low to mid-single-digits in FY'25 in constant currency, consistent with our long-term outlook. And we expect our operating margin to continue to be near the top of our 16% to 19% long-term range, including in Q1, as we continue to exercise disciplined cost management and execute on our Future Ready plans. Beyond the segment, we expect Corporate Other to be relatively flat year-over-year at approximately $1 billion. Keep in mind that due to the timing of our stock compensation expense, we expect approximately one-third of our annual corporate other expense in Q1. With all of this, we expect FY'25 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.45 to $3.75 and FY'25 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.06 to $3.36. For Q1, we expect first quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.76 and first quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.63. Overall, we expect EPS to be stronger in the second half with sequential improvements in each quarter. On FY\u201925 free cash flow, we expect to deliver between $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion with growth in line with earnings. As typical, we expect the second half to be stronger than the first. Consistent with our net earnings and recognizing that our first quarter is typically lower given the timing of our prior year incentive comp payment. On capital allocation, we remain committed to returning approximately 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders over time as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x and there aren't better return opportunities. In closing, we are excited for our future and also pleased to announce today that we are raising our annual dividend by 5% to $1.16 per share. This is the ninth consecutive annual increase since our separation in 2015, and reflects the confidence we and our Board have in our long-term outlook ahead. With that, I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questioner today will be Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Hi. Thank you so much. Your -- typically your first quarter EPS is about 25% of the full year. This year you're guiding to EPS that's closer to 20%. Can you talk about some of the puts and takes over there? I know you called out the timing of stock comp. But is there anything else that's driving the delta over there as well? And I have a follow-up. Karen Parkhill : Yes. Thanks for the question, Wamsi. In our Q1, EPS is typically down sequentially. So keep in mind, we have seasonal volume declines in the first quarter. And yes, we do have a sequential increase in corporate other expense in the quarter and that's really driven by the timing of our stock compensation expense. I said we expect roughly 1/3 of it to hit in Q1. Wamsi Mohan : I guess my follow-up is really around your Future Ready transformation plan where you've done a lot of cost optimization already. But when we look at the EPS guide for next year, presumably most of that's really coming from share buybacks, which would mean that your organic operating income is roughly flat despite all these cost optimizations. Why should we not see a higher improvement in free cash flow next year? Especially as you're starting to expect PCs to grow and you're also lapping some of these restructuring charge, the magnitude at least is going down on restructuring charges as well. So, why isn't free cash somewhat materially higher range closer to a couple of years ago? Karen Parkhill : Yes. We're pleased with the free cash flow we delivered this fiscal year and we do expect it to continue to grow roughly in line with earnings. We intend to drive continued improvement in working capital and free cash flow just as we have in the past few years. We expect that to continue. And as we enter the third year of our Future Ready cost plan, we expect to spend a little less on restructuring charges, but we will offset with some slightly higher capital expenditures to support our growth plans. But again, we expect free cash flow to grow roughly in line with earnings. Enrique Lores : And also another comment about your first observation, when we look at EPS growth year-on-year, it's driven both by share buybacks but we are also expecting growth of operating profit and this is really what is supporting the midpoint of the guide. Operator : The next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Erik Woodring : Awesome. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Enrique or Karen, I guess maybe Karen this one would be for you. You've done 19% print operating margins effectively three years in a row now, all in years in which revenue \u2013 print revenue has been down low to mid-single-digits. So maybe my question is why is 16% to 19% the correct range and why wouldn't it be higher or has there been a degree of over earning that at some point should normalize in the future? I'm just trying to understand the relative outperformance versus the target. And then I have a follow-up. Karen Parkhill : Yes, thanks for the question. You've seen us operate at this high end of the range both in Q4 and the full year, and we do expect that to continue in FY'25. We are focused on protecting our profitability in print. We've been reducing unprofitable units through our shift to Big Tank. We've also been increasing the lifetime customer profitability with growth in our subscription business and we're gaining share in some of the higher value categories in office. As we think about the guide, the range going forward, we're maintaining the lower end of the range, just so we can have flexibility to lean in where we find opportunity. But we're also going to remain cognizant of the dynamic market conditions that we've seen in recent years. Enrique Lores : And Erik, this is very consistent with previous conversations. As Karen just said, we want to have flexibility to lean in in case we see opportunity to place more positive hardware units. And if we do see the opportunity, we're going to have that and this may put some pressure on the margin on specific quarter. But nothing has changed from previous conversations. Erik Woodring : Right. Okay. Very fair. Thank you, guys. And then my follow-up. Enrique, after a strong 4Q in which you gained share in both print and PCs, can you maybe just help us understand maybe why you don't expect to gain share next year talking about growing in line with the market? Is there any kind of competitive pressures that are rising maybe from, for example, where the yen is today, or are you just trying to be a bit more conservative in setting expectations so early in the year? And that's it for me. Enrique Lores : I would say it's more the latter. Erik, we want to be conservative in the assumptions. Of course, our goal is going to be to grow share. But as we always say, grow share in profitable categories. Our goal is not to grow share for the sake of growing share. It's really about focusing on those areas, where we see opportunity to do it in a profitable way. This year we have grown share in PCs, especially in commercial. And as we have said during the prepared remarks, commercial is going to continue to be our priority. Operator : Up next, we'll take a question from Amit Daryanani, Evercore ISI. Irvin Liu : Hi. Thank you. This is Irvin Liu on for Amit. I have one and a follow-up as well. So if I heard correctly, AI PC units were 15% of shipments during your fiscal Q4 and expected to expand to 25% next year. As this mix expands, what sort of implications will this have for all - AI PCs have for ASPs and your PS margins? Enrique Lores : Yes. We have not changed our view on the impact that AI PCs are going to have and current results support the assumptions that we have seen. The AI PCs are going to drive an improvement of average selling price. What we have been saying until now when we confirm is three years from now, we expect them to be between 40% and 60% of the mix and half around between a 5% and a 10% impact on the overall category. That\u2019s the direction that we are taking and the current shipments and pricing supports what we have seen until now. Irvin Liu : Got it. And then for my follow-up, with the upcoming change in administration and potential for tariffs, can you just talk about how you are positioned to mitigate any potential impacts to your supply chain? Enrique Lores : Perfect. Thank you. And first, let me say that we are really willing to collaborate with the new administration to reach the best solution for both our customers and our shareholders. If you think about what we've been talking about in the last few years, we have done a lot of work to make our supply chain footprint more resilient and we have been building factories in different parts of the world to be able to respond to changes in the geopolitical environment. So today, we're in a much stronger position than we were three years ago. We think that compared to other companies in our industry, we are in a strong position. At this point, it's hard to know what exactly the new tariffs are going to be. What I can say is we have a strong team that knows how to manage this type of environment. And as we know what the final policies will be, we will build best plan for the company. Operator : Our next question today will come from Toni Sacconaghi, Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : I just wanted to follow-up on the last question first. My understanding is outside of inkjet printer cartridges, essentially everything HP makes is outside of the country and imported. So, if we did have a tariff on all incoming goods, which is sort of the current statement from the administration. How does HP respond to that? I understand you may have less time exposure, but you're still making essentially all of your products aside from inkjet cartridges, I believe, outside the U.S. So how would you address a global tariff on imported goods specifically? Enrique Lores : We have said Toni at this point, we don't want to speculate on what the final tariffs are going to be. We will respond to whatever the final decisions are and actively manage our supply chain to do that. You are correct, we have a small percentage of production today in the U.S. is a bit broader than the inkjet cartridges, but as you said, we produce most of our products outside the US. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. And if I could follow-up, maybe you could just describe what's your Mexico exposure because there actually has been a policy statement on that. So what is your Mexico exposure? And then, as my follow-up, Enrique or Karen, as we look forward to next year, it sounds like you're expecting supplies to decline 3%, 4% low single-digits, but potentially the printing business to grow, which would mean that hardware would be positive. Why would that shift not pressure margins? And what's the offset to keep margins at the high end of the range? Enrique Lores : Let me take both questions, Toni. First of all, on Mexico, we don't disclose the specific percentage of products that we get from them. So I will defer the answer to that question. In terms of print, what we have said is in fiscal year '25, we expect the market to decline and this should be consistent to what you see also from the HP perspective, our goal is to do at least as well as market, but we are going to see some pressure on revenue from the print perspective. And as you said, our guide, our expectation is that supply is consistently with what we have been saying in the past will continue to decline low to mid-single digits or no change in our view on that. Operator : Your next question will come from Samik Chatterjee, JPMorgan. Samik Chatterjee : I guess for the first one, if I can go to the outlook that you shared for the PC market. I think you said commercial in particular, growing higher than mid-single digit. I know that's sort of the consensus right now in the industry analysts, but just curious how you sort of thinking about that outcome sort of playing out in terms of the confidence in enterprises sort of refreshing ahead of that deadline in terms of Windows end of life, but particularly given that we've all been a bit surprised that enterprises haven't refreshed as much this year. How are you thinking about sort of the validity of that growth expectation as well as the likelihood that they don't really deprioritize when they're investing towards AI infrastructure, they don't end up deprioritizing PCs as a part of that spending sort of overall bucket that they're looking at. And I have a follow-up as well. Enrique Lores : Yes. So I think, first of all, if we look at what has happened in Q4, we have seen revenue growth in the commercial space of 5% and unit growth of 4%. So we are already at a fairly significant growth in the commercial PC space. And when we think about next year, first of all, we think that the fact that the winter retrench has started in a slower way than previous transitions as we shared last quarter, just makes the opportunity in '25 bigger because there is a deadline in the fall next year where support costs for Windows 10 is going to significantly, significantly increase and therefore, company will have a strong incentive to change. On top of that, we continue to have an aged installed base that needs to be refreshed, which has been driving the growth that we have seen in Q4. And we -- the mix of AI PCs will continue to grow, which also is going to create a tailwind for the business. But these are the key assumptions that we have. And on top of that, as we have done this year, we will continue to prioritize premium categories we have been growing share and this continues to be the goal for us as a company. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. And for my follow-up, I mean, Karen, maybe this is for you, just going back to Wamsi's earlier question on this. What's driving the seasonality for earnings in 1Q? I understand the sort of drivers that are impacting earnings, but are you expecting anything different from a typical seasonality when it comes to the revenue outcomes for the quarter as well. If you can just clarify that. Karen Parkhill : Yes. So for revenue, we're expecting growth both year-over-year in the quarter and for the full year at the total company level with strength in PS offsetting a likely decline in print. In terms of just our ramp through the year on EPS, we said that we expect a stronger second half and that Q1 should be our lowest quarter with improvement throughout the year. And I would say the main drivers of that are more pronounced PS revenue seasonality tied to the PC recovery along with the actions that we're taking to improve PS margins in the back half. And as we already mentioned, we expect that step down in corporate other costs as we move past Q1. And I would say, lastly, we're also expecting this higher penetration of AI PC models as we move through the year. So those, along with our growth segments really drive an improvement to our margin profile. Enrique Lores : And let me add a comment on cost. As we shared in the prepared remarks, we have seen pressure from commodity costs in Q4. We expect that this pressure will continue in Q1 but that through the year to repricing and through additional cost that we are -- actions that we are taking to qualify lower components to concentrate volumes in a few specific SKUs, we will be able to compensate for that. And this also creates an improvement quarter-on-quarter that is what is supporting the guidance. Operator : The next question will come Asiya Merchant Citi. Asiya Merchant : If I can just double click on your growth services. I think it was 20%, and I believe you said it grew mid-single digits. How should we think about the expectations for these growth businesses to perform into next year? What are some of the drivers that would potentially accelerate growth here? Because I think at the analyst event, you guys did share higher growth actions. And if you could talk about some of the drivers for the growth business. Enrique Lores : Yes. Thank you. So it's early work that we talked about a few of them to explain and what are the expectations that we have for next year. But the overall is that they will continue to grow faster than the overall company, which is why for us are very important going forward. If we think, for example, about growth that we expect in consumer services, we expect the number of subscribers to continue to grow. And also, we are expanding the portfolio of services that we offer. During this year, we offered a print as a service program. We offer the all-in program, and we will see the adoption of these two programs to continue to increase. We also have seen solid growth, especially in the second half on our Workforce Solutions portfolio, especially in the print as a service devices a service and conference room as a service and we expect these businesses to continue their growth next year. We have a strong second half on hybrid systems, but the market -- commercial recovers we see growth in the category and we expect it to continue to grow in '25. Most of them, we see opportunity to grow driven by the market and also driven by the innovation that we are going to continue to bring to market across many categories. This is why, for us, going forward, we see this strong opportunity in commercial in redefining the future of work, which is basically integrating AI into our full portfolio and allowing customers from an enterprise perspective to drive productivity and from an employee perspective to increase the fulfillment that they get with the activities they do. And this is going to be more and more the overall focus of the company. Operator : We'll take the next question from Krish Sankar, TD Cowen. Krish Sankar : I have two of them. First one, Enrique, thanks for your color on next year and AI PC and all the good stuff. I'm kind of curious, what exactly is the definition of AI PC? Does it have a higher silicon content like NPU, CPU memory? How do you describe AI PC because it was 15% of last quarter mix? And if there is a higher silicon content, what is the bond cost impact to margins? And then I have a follow-up. Enrique Lores : Sure. So when we talk about the 15%, we view the official definition that IDC is using, which are PCs that have an NPU built-in. And this is what we are using for 15% to be consistent with the rest of the industry. Our focus really is more in what we call next-generation AI PCs that are defined by, first, being a stronger more powerful NPU of above 40 tops. Second, of being able to run what we call our AI companion, which is our own model designed to accelerate productivity in the office when running at the edge. And third, especially in the commercial space, PCs that have enhanced security capabilities because of having the NPU and some of the software and models that we are building into them. This next gen AI PC, we just started to ship during Q4. So the impact they have had this year is limited, but what made them very exciting is we have been able to give them to software companies to start developing new solutions. We displayed some of them in our margin event and the impact in productivity that they are going to have is very significant. But if you ask me how confident I am about the impact the AI PCs are going to have is even more than before because I have seen them in action. I see the opportunity that they bring, and I think it's going to be a very, very strong part of our portfolio in the coming years. Krish Sankar : Got it. Very helpful. Enrique for the clarification too. And one other quick follow-up. You mentioned that commodity cost pressure is going to be there into the early part of next year. Typically, what is the lag effect you see? Because the reason I'm asking is that if you look at most forecasts, memory, DRAM and NAND, which is a big part of your commodity cost is expected to decline in calendar Q1. If that is true, when do you see the benefit of that? Enrique Lores : Yes. We expect to continue to see pressure from commodity costs through the first half of our fiscal year. So our calendar Q4 and calendar Q1 and then this to be mitigated in the second half of the year, especially because of all the work that we are doing first on repricing. We did repricing in Q4. We will continue to do that, but there is always a difference in time between cost increases and price increases. But over time, this gets compensated. And also, as I mentioned before, the work that we are doing from a cost perspective to qualify lower components to integrate or to increase the volume on some specific SKUs, simplifying our offering so we can buy more of a single component. The three actions should help us to mitigate the impact in the second half of our fiscal year. Karen Parkhill : And I would just add, Chris that our strategic buys helped us when commodity cost pressures first started. And now we're working on repricing and cost-down actions. It just takes time to take hold. Operator : Up next is David Vogt, UBS. David Vogt : The first one is maybe Enrique on print. I just want to go back to the competitive landscape because the yen has been such a headwind for so long. It doesn't sound like you were that concerned or that impacted this quarter. Kind of what's going on in that margin? How does that play out into fiscal '25? And then I'll give you my second question at the same time. So given sort of the improvement that you're thinking about in the top line next year and the really strong margins in print, given the Future Ready plan, any thought to why the capital return policy still fixates around sort of cross leverage at 2 turns, given the structural margin improvement that you've made in the print business despite the revenue decline. And I'll just turn it back. Enrique Lores : I'll take the first one, and then Karen will take the second. In terms of competitive environment in print, we have not seen a significant change. We continue to see our Japanese competitors taking strong advantage of the weakness of the yen and the ratio has not changed. What has changed is that during the last two quarters, as we announced at the beginning of the year, we have been working to aggressively reduce the cost of our products so we could compete more aggressively and we have started to gain share, both in home and in office. But it's not so much a result of the competitive environment getting easier, is really a consequence of all the work that we are doing as part of our Future-Ready plan as you said. Karen Parkhill : And just on the cap allocation policy, returning capital to shareholders is a priority for us. And our capital allocation policy has not changed, where we still expect to return approximately 100% of our free cash flow over the long-term as long as higher ROI opportunities aren't there, and we maintain our leverage ratio of 2x, just under 2x. On the leverage ratio, we do evaluate it every year. And our analysis continues to indicate that this is the optimal level for us. And it's aligned with the credit rating that is also aligned with our peers and provides us ample access to short-term liquidity. Operator : Next question is Michael Ng, Goldman Sachs. Michael Ng : I just have two as well. Just a follow-up on David's question regarding print. It was great to hear that you're working to reduce the cost and price of your products, you see it in the unit growth this quarter. I was wondering if you expect to see continued unit growth as we head into next year as a result of some of your price actions. And then, I'll give you the second one as well. Just on the PC refresh, it's widely understood that this October 2025 is a hard deadline. I was just wondering, in prior cycles, have you seen enterprises do much by way of extended support? Or does that not really kind of impacting at all? Enrique Lores : In terms of print, our expectation is that next year market is going to slightly decline. And this is our expectation and also the expectations from most of the industry analysts. Our goal is going to continue to grow share if units are profitable at the system level. So this continues to be our goal. But at this point, it's hard to predict exactly how competitors are going to be responding. Of course, we are going to maintain our effort to continue to reduce costs as we always do. And then in terms of the PC refresh, what we have seen previously is the companies respond to the deadline. And this is why we are saying that we expect this to accelerate through 2025, given that compared to previous refreshes, the refresh is going a little bit slower. And this is why in '25 and especially in the second half, we expect an improvement for a further improvement of commercial demand driven by this transition. Operator : Next up, we'll take a question from Ananda Baruah, Loop Capital Markets. Ananda Baruah : Appreciate it. I guess Enrique sticking with print and market decline, can you give us a sense of what you're thinking for commercial relative to consumer? I'll get up to here. Commercial decline drove the consumer decline. And on the commercial side, what are the trends -- what are the sort of dynamics that are informing the market as you can best see them? How much is macro? How much it back off is anecdotally. And then so how much is, call it, maybe shift to digital and other things? Enrique Lores : Okay. Ananda, let me provide some color. So we -- when we look at the different segments in print, we expect that in '25, consumer will continue to decline. So no change from what we have seen. In the other side, we see two dynamics. We see traction that we expect that will decline. But we see what we call contractual office where Managed Print Services is part of it that will have a better performance than transactional. And when we think about areas to focus for us, clearly, this is an opportunity because the market will perform better and also because our share is lower than in other segments, you should expect us to really go after that category. And then finally, we expect to continue to see growth in the industrial space. We saw strong growth in the second half of this year, and we expect to continue to see that in '25. Operator : Next up is Aaron Rakers, Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : I'm going to throw two of them out right away. So I guess as we kind of start to focus or definitely shift our focus to the Windows upgrade cycle looking into next year. I'm curious, as you guys think about the market opportunity, any of the data that you look at just sizing how large this AI are, this Windows installed base -- aged installed base looks to be as we think about that going forward? And then I just want to be clear, like if you look at the PC market, my second question, if you look at your PC growth estimate of mid-single digits, I think that more or less is in line with where industry shipment expectations are? Why would we not see some ASP benefit from these AI PCs on top of that unit growth as we look into next year? I'm just curious how you're thinking about that. Enrique Lores : Sure. The first part of your question, the answer is definitely yes. We have a lot of analytics that support the opportunity about the refresh analytics that we have and also analytics at Microsoft has and that we share because we -- it's a common interest for both companies to drive. And this is what helps us to assess how much conversion has happened and how much opportunity we have going forward. In terms of ASP help from the PC side, we have seen for this year, we have seen revenue growth above unit growth and we expect a similar phenomenon to happen in '25. And this is part of the guide and that we have provided today. Karen Parkhill : Yes, we do expect that we will benefit from ASP growth next year and in the first quarter, and that's really just given the enhancement of premium offerings, including the richer mix of AI PCs. Operator : And everyone, at this time, there are no further questions. Enrique Lores : Perfect. Thank you, everybody for joining today's call. I know it's a bit later than other calls, especially for those of you in the East Coast. So thank you for being here. As you have heard, we are very optimistic about the plan that we have in '25. The company -- our expectation is that the company will be growing both revenue and operating profit. And going forward, we see a strong opportunity in defining the future of work, in helping companies to drive productivity improvement and helping employees to get more fulfillment from their work. A very exciting opportunity that is going to be driving the priorities that we use going forward. So again, thank you for joining today. And for those of you in the U.S., we wish you a very happy Thanksgiving Day. Thank you. Operator : Once again, everyone that does conclude today's conference. We would like to thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
