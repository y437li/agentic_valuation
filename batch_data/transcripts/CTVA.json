With that introduction, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Collins : Thank you, Megan, and thank you also to those joining our call today. Earlier today, we reported the second quarter results for Corteva, our first quarter reporting as an independent company. Two months ago, on June 1, we completed the separation of Corteva from DowDuPont, a culmination of 3.5 years of journey and a significant milestone for our milestone for our employees, our customers and now, we are pleased to say, our shareholders. With our spend, we created a new kind of ag company. A global pure play, built on a foundation of industry leadership and focused on bringing new and integrated solutions to farmers, enriching the lives of those who produce and those who consume, and ensuring progress for generations to come. That is our purpose. And in our early days, as a public company, have deepened our resolve on delivering on that purpose. The unprecedented market backdrop for the second quarter presented considerable challenges to our customers and, in turn, to us; flooding, planting delays, prevented planting, delayed deliveries, insect pressures, trade-related market disruptions, the list is long and exceptional when viewed from the lens of history. In 150 years of tracking data in our industry, the events that transpired in North America region this season are without precedent. Now amid these historic events, both our spend and market disruptions, we've worked hard to deliver progress this quarter on our priorities for shareholder value creation noted on Slide 4. These priorities continue to guide our actions and underscore the quality of the results that we are targeting. First, two announcements this quarter reinforced our commitment to return the excess cash to shareholders. In June, we announced the authorization of a share buyback program to return $1 billion to shareholders, which we expect to complete over the next three years. Additionally, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share, consistent with our earlier indications. These are proof points regarding our confidence in the strength of our long-term strategy. On our priority related to developing innovative solutions, I'm pleased to report that in the second quarter, we began recognizing licensing income related to our Enlist E3 trait, where we already have over 100 executed licenses to date. We also began seeing traction in the market in terms of units sold. Over 150,000 units were sold through our rep network in the quarter. Although, this represents a small percentage of our overall units, it highlights our early groundwork toward reaching our target of having this technology on 10% of North America planted acres in 2020. Now beyond Enlist E3 soybeans, new product launches overall are driving both sales and operating EBITDA improvement in the quarter with growth from Qrome and PowerCore Ultra in Seed and Arylex herbicides, Zorvec fungicides and Isoclast insecticides in Crop Protection. We continue to see solid momentum in our Crop Protection product portfolio with geographic label expansions for Arylex, Isoclast, Rinskor and Zorvec. This includes the very recent registration we received in Brazil for Isoclast and Rinskor. On cost advantage and our priority around best-in-class cost structure, we delivered $115 million in cost synergies in the quarter and approximately $200 million in cost synergies through the first half of this year, exceeding the original target set for this time frame by about $50 million. Overall, when you add up what we have delivered since the merger closed, we have realized cumulative cost savings of $700 million through the end of this quarter, which is approximately 60% of our $1.2 billion commitment. On top of that, we announced earlier this year that we are targeting an additional $500 million in operating EBITDA improvement over the next five years. To further our progress in this regard, we launched a company-wide initiative this quarter that we are calling Execute To Win, or E To W. This effort is focused on establishing an owner mindset for all of our employees to drive the cultural reinforcement that will be needed to deliver and sustain our growth and productivity gains long term. We look forward to providing additional detail on this effort and our productivity plans in the coming months. And finally, regarding our second quarter performance. Outside of North America, we've realized net sales growth of 10% and organic sales growth of 17% in the quarter, demonstrating the balance inherent in our global operating footprint today. Though our results were negatively impacted by the North American market, we capitalize on strong performance outside of North America and realize results that demonstrate our ability to set expectations and deliver what we promise. So moving to Chart 5 and a few highlights on our key performance indicators for the quarter. Net sales decreased 3% versus the same quarter last year. Market disruptions due to the weather in North America significantly delayed planting, resulted in volume declines in both segments from reduced planted acres and missed Crop Protection applications during the quarter. Sales were also impacted by ongoing currency headwinds and pricing pressures in Seed. Outside of North America, organic net sales were up 17% versus the same period last year on both volume and price improvement, demonstrating the strength of our new product launches and reflecting significant benefit to the quarter from an early start to the season in Latin America. Operating EBITDA decreased 6% for the quarter, largely driven by declines in the North American market. Demand for new Crop Protection products resulted in margin expansion in the quarter, which helped to partially offset the impact of currency, raw material cost increases and declines in North America. Selling, administrative and R&D costs declined 9% in the quarter on a net basis. This result highlights the benefit of our cost synergies as well as the discretionary actions our teams are taking to curtail spending in light of the impacts of the market-driven declines in our results. Slide 6 shows second quarter highlights by region. I'll start with our results in North America. North American sales declined 8% for the quarter due to the weather-related planting delays that drove reductions in planted area, a significant level of products switching and a loss of Crop Protection applications. Uncertainty remains on the planted acres, and the USDA announced plans to perform a broad resurvey in July that is expected to be released on August 12. The Crop Protection in North America, elevated channel inventories are impacting restocking. Additionally, competitive price actions, generic price pressure and large distributor inventory-reduction initiatives are impacting pricing. On a positive note, indications are that demand for Corteva Crop Protection products with Pioneer customers is strong, driven by joint offers like TruChoice and Corteva Cash. Moving to Latin America, we are seeing strong early demand with net sales up 39% on an organic basis. The trend toward an early season started in December of 2018 with the spring [ph] season and has continued with a very strong early start to the summer season. We estimate that approximately $80 million in sales, that would normally have occurred in the third quarter, have moved into the second quarter. Sales have also been bolstered by demand for new products, including year-over-year growth for picoxy, Dermacor and herbicides in Crop Protection in PowerCore Ultra and Leptra corn products in Seed.  In Asia Pacific, with organic net sales up 10%, the clear headline is Crop Protection volume growth due to higher pest pressure and pricing on supply-constrained, high-demand products across. The region is seeing broad-based volume and price growth in Spinosyn insecticides across several markets and crops. Corteva is pleased to have a strong solution to offer customers to address pest pressures evident in the region. Our Spinosyn's technology, while supply constrained, remains an important tool in the local market. In addition to the Spinosyn\u2019s growth, the launch of Rinskor rice herbicide in China and pricing growth in both corn and rice seed contributed to results in the quarter in Asia Pacific.  Finishing with Europe, Middle East and Africa, up 6% on an organic basis. EMEA has had a strong season, particularly in Seed. Share gains in our oil seed portfolio, particularly in sunflower in Eastern Europe and implementation of a direct agency model in Eastern Europe have delivered volume gains. The region also delivered organic growth in Crop Protection due to strong penetration of Lumiposa seed treatments. Increased demand for new Crop Production products, like Zorvec fungicide, recently launched in grapes and potatoes. And Arylex cereal herbicides are also contributing to growth in the region. Currency devaluation in the region has impacted overall sales growth by 9%. I'll turn now to Slide 7 and cover the drivers of our operating EBITDA results for the first half and updates to our guidance for the second half and full year operating EBITDA. Looking at the first half, pro forma operating EBITDA is down 13% compared to the same period last year. Our focus on controlling costs and realizing cost synergies delivered about $200 million in the first half, $50 million ahead of where we expected it to be. In terms of volume and price, there were several drivers that impacted our results. Starting with new products, we generated $50 million of EBITDA improvement in the first half, predominantly in the Crop Protection segment. Price and volume improvements across the rest of our portfolio contributed $120 million in incremental benefit to the first half versus last year before we factor in the impact of the North American market. We estimate that the North American market for the first half represents an approximate $350 million headwind, an estimate that reflects lower-than-expected planted area for corn, soybeans and canola, missed Crop Protection applications and shifts to lower margin products, including shorter-maturity corn products. This estimate also includes the impact of delayed sales, a Seed delivery shifted into the third quarter as well as early deliveries that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018. Netting with the seasonal shifts, the full year impact from the challenging market conditions in North America is estimated to be approximately $250 million. Looking ahead to the second half due to the late North American season, we see some Seed revenue shifting into the third quarter, primarily in soybeans. This impact is almost directly offset by the volumes that shifted into the second quarter due to the early-season in Latin America. Consistent with our statements earlier this year on the second half, we continue to expect strong price improvement year-over-year on supply constrained, high demand products, primarily in our insecticide portfolio. And we expect to have year-over-year improvement in Latin America in the second half. We will keep up our momentum to deliver additional cost savings from synergies in the second half, bringing our annual incremental savings to $350 million. On top of this, we are beginning to stage other productivity initiatives related to the additional $500 million in incremental operating EBITDA improvements, I mentioned earlier. We'll have more to share on specific actions as we work through them. In total, we expect to deliver operating EBITDA that's about breakeven for the second half by using the midpoint of the range provided. This represents an approximate $200 million improvement over prior year, which is in line with the improvement we guided to back in May for the second half. We add it all up, this means we are guiding to an operating EBITDA range of $1.9 billion to $2.05 billion for fiscal 2019, down about 5% versus 2018, using the midpoint. On net sales for full year 2019, we expect declines of roughly 3%, predominantly on currency headwinds. On an organic basis, we expect sales to be about flat year-over-year. Now before I turn the call over to Greg, I will summarize by saying that it is difficult to overstate how challenging this year has been to-date. However, our team has waited a long time for the chance to be a standalone company, and we intend to show the market what we can deliver. With that, I'll turn it over to Greg, who will get into the details behind our second quarter and first half results. Greg? Greg Friedman : Thank you, Jim. Turning now to Slide 8 for a summary of our second quarter results. Please note that all the periods, except for the three months ended June 30, 2019, are on a pro forma basis for operating EBITDA and operating EPS. As Jim mentioned, the effects of our North America business from unprecedented weather-related events continue to impact our overall results for the second quarter via delayed planting and lower-than-expected planted area in corn, soybeans and canola and missed Crop Protection applications. Net sales of $5.6 billion were down 3% versus prior year on currency headwinds of 2%, a 1% decline in local price and volumes that were essentially flat. Excluding North America, Rest Of the World volumes were up 14%, led by strong early demand in Latin America Crop Protection products, including 73% year-over-year growth in sales from new products worldwide. This includes products, such as our Isoclast insecticide and Zorvec fungicide. Competitive pricing pressure in North America soybeans coupled with higher replant in corn, more than offset the price improvements we achieved in Asia-Pacific from broad-based demand from new products across several crops and market. For Rest of the World, we recorded organic sales growth of 17% in the quarter versus prior year. Turning to operating EBITDA, we reported $1.45 billion or a 6% decline versus the second quarter of 2018 on a pro forma basis. Overall, declines were led by lower margins in Seed from the impacts of replanting corn and pricing pressures in soybeans. We delivered $115 million of synergies in the quarter, and currency was a headwind in the quarter. Our operating EBITDA margins were equally pressured by headwinds within Seed, driven by the overall North American market. This more than offset the 150 basis point margin expansion we delivered in Crop Protection in the second quarter. Overall, we delivered an operating EBITDA margin of 26%, down 80 basis points from the prior year on a pro forma basis. This translated into operating earnings per share of $1.42, down 9% from the second quarter of 2018 on a pro forma basis. Turning now to Slide 9 for a year-over-year comparison on our operating EPS. Realized cost savings from synergies contributed $0.13 to operating EPS in the quarter, while volume and price improvements across the rest of the portfolio of $0.06 were offset by the impact of the North American market. Currency was a $0.05 headwind in the quarter. In addition, the impact of changes in our base tax rate on pretax income was a hurt of $0.07. Our base tax rate for the quarter, which excludes exchange gains and losses, was 17.4%, up from the second quarter of 2018 rate of 13.8%. And lastly, we generated $0.04 of benefit from foreign exchange gains, related to our hedging program to offset exposures for the foreign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities that we carry on our balance sheet. Turning to our segment results, Slide 10 highlights the performance for the quarter and the half in both our Crop Protection and Seed segments. In Crop Protection, net sales were $3.3 billion for the first six months of 2019, down 2% from the prior period. The decrease was primarily due to a 5% decline from currency, partially offset by a 2% increase in local price and a 1% increase in volume. For the quarter, our top line was impacted similarly by currency, offsetting the strong growth that we experienced in Latin America. Crop Protection operating EBITDA was $670 million for the first six months of 2019, down 10% from the first six months of 2018. Unfavorable currency, volume declines in North America and a higher input costs drove the decline in operating EBITDA, while the segment delivered on cost synergies. In the quarter, Crop Protection delivered 150 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion. In Seed, we reported net sales of $5.7 billion for the first six months of 2019, down 8% from the same period last year. The decline was primarily due to weather-related impacts in North America and the impact of early deliveries of corn seed in the fourth quarter of 2018, which were partially offset by a favorable corn seed demand in the EMEA. Currency was a headwind of 3%. In the quarter, we saw similar impacts from the North American market, partially offset by strong early demand in Latin America. Seed operating EBITDA of $1.4 billion for the first half of 2019 was equally challenged by the impact of the North American market, down 15%. Our results reflect pricing pressure and lower volumes from weather, coupled with unfavorable currency and the delivery of cost synergy benefits in the quarter. Our second quarter Seed operating EBITDA was equally impacted by the North American market. Turning now to Slide 11 for a closer look at our operating results on a seasonal or first-half basis. Starting with Crop Protection. Reported net sales were down 2%, primarily due to the impact of currency, partially offset by a 2% increase in local price and a 1% increase in volume. Organic sales growth was 3%. And outside North America, organic sales growth was 17%. In North America, organic sales were down 17% on lower volumes due to lost spring applications in nitrogen stabilizers and corn and soybean herbicides from the impacts of wet weather. Latin America sales grew substantially with 43% organic growth on 37% higher volumes with strong early demand for the upcoming season. Approximately $80 million of sales were realized in the half which typically occur in the third quarter. Early demand was concentrated in our insect management product portfolio, including Spinosyn insecticide and Seed applied technologies as we worked with growers on providing the best solutions to their current pest challenges that they face in that market. We also delivered a 6% price improvement for the quarter, and currency was a headwind of 7% for the region. In Asia-Pacific, organic net sales were up 16% on higher volume and price, our results reflect strong demand for insecticides from broad-based growth in several markets, coupled with continued traction in new products, like Rinskor herbicides and Isoclast insecticides. Currency was a headwind of 5%. In EMEA, organic sales were up 5%. Sales growth was driven by the strong and balanced season, coupled with continued demand for Zorvec fungicide. Currency was a headwind of 9%. Turning to Slide 12, where I\u2019ll cover the first half performance for our Seed segment. In Seed, reported net sales were down 8% on 4% lower volume, a 3% decline in currency and 1% lower price. Outside of North America, we delivered organic sales growth of 7%. In North America, Seed sales were down 10%. Volume was down 8% on weaker volumes from weather-related delays and reduced plantings, coupled with the early shipments of Seed that were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018. Price was down 2% due to the competitive pricing environment around soybeans as well as higher corn replant. In Latin America, organic sales were up 2% driven by 2% higher volumes. We delivered an increased early demand for corn seed in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Currency was a headwind of 5%. And in Asia Pacific, organic sales were up 3% driven by higher prices in the Southeast Asia market. Volumes were flat to slightly up as we did see some demand impact on corn due to dry weather in the region. Currency was a headwind of 7%. And lastly, in EMEA, we delivered organic sales growth of 9% from volume and price improvements for the half on balanced and increased demand in the local market. Our top line results reflect strong demand for corn in Southern Europe as well as volume and price improvements, together with expected share gains in our sunflower lineup in Eastern Europe. Currency was a headwind of 10%. Turning now to Slide 13, I\u2019ll provide an update to the modeling guidance that we shared earlier this year for 2019. Just to recap Jim\u2019s earlier comment on how we will see the second half of the year playing out, we are expecting about $200 million improvement in our operating EBITDA for the second half versus prior year. In terms of the quarterly split for the second half, we have historically run at a loss in the third quarter and generated a profit in the fourth quarter. In the 8-K we filed this morning, we have provided historical quarterly data for pro forma sales and operating EBITDA. For interest expense, given better visibility into our delevering of heritage debt, we have narrowed our range for interest expense to be $140 million to $160 million for 2019. The next few items remain unchanged from our prior guidance. Operating tax rate of 19% to 21%, and depreciation and amortization of $1 billion. Note that we exclude all amortization expense from our operating EPS, which is estimated at $400 million for 2019. Additionally, in terms of our $1 billion stock repurchase program, I would expect that we will capitalize on some opportunity in 2019 depending on the current market environment, cash levers and operating needs. We expect there will be more opportunity to expand on this in 2020. As it relates to costs and the current market environment, I will emphasize the focus the organization has on delivering on our commitments in light of the current market situation. This includes delivering on the synergy targets we have communicated, executing on the additional $500 million of operational EBITDA improvements over the next five years from ongoing productivity actions driven by Execute To Win, and reducing our standalone cost to achieve best-in-class cost structure as a company. And finally, I\u2019m pleased to announce that I will host a webcast on August 15 to cover certain topics related to our standalone financials. Here, I will take a deeper dive into the modeling considerations and address some of the questions that we\u2019ve received. More details to come, and I hope you can join us. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Megan to open the Q&A. Megan Britt : Thank you, Greg. With that, let\u2019s move on to your questions. I\u2019d like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both in our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Jim, just in 2020, I know it\u2019s early, but on a very high level, could you just help us think about how the EBITDA might look in 2020 versus 2019, given the benefits from some cost savings, productivity and some maybe higher planted acres? And maybe some headwinds from some higher costs? Thank you. Jim Collins : Great. Thanks, David. Yes, directionally, we think about going into 2020. Obviously, we\u2019ve got to factor in what it \u2013 what\u2019s the impact of the North American market in 2019 and what return we can expect as that market comes back to us. Clearly, we\u2019ll continue to have the synergy programs, that we talked to you about, flowing through the momentum that we\u2019re carrying through from 2019, and we\u2019ve given guidance on kind of what to expect year-over-year in that area. It comes down to also then the market backdrop, what can be expect around commodity prices on corn and soy, and given the focus on planting intentions. And as we sit here today, we\u2019ve got a couple of big markets still to clear through. We\u2019ve got to finalize the North American market that we have in the ground right now. There are obviously going to be questions about the actual harvested quantities of grain versus the acres that got planted. So quality as well as yield is still a big question. And then we have a strong Latin American market to work through, both the summer and the spring seasons down there. So all in all, it could be shaping up to be a strong season as we see some snapback and a few of the things that I\u2019ve talked about really start to add to our results in a very positive way. So we\u2019ll \u2013 we\u2019ve obviously not given any guidance for 2020 here at this point, and we\u2019ll be back as we close out the year to kind of set that up. I don\u2019t know. Either, Greg, anyone else add anything. Great. Operator : Our next question we\u2019ll come from Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Thanks very much. So two questions. What are the key regulatory approvals that you\u2019re awaiting? And when do you expect them, in rough terms, to occur? And secondly, you talked about doing $1.9 billion to $2 billion in EBITDA. What kind of operating cash flow does that generate? Or on a normal basis, what\u2019s your target for operating cash flow divided by EBITDA? Jim Collins : Great. Thanks, Jeff. We had a number of new registrations that occurred for us here in the first half of 2019. So we\u2019re carrying some good momentum. Some of those were key active ingredients in our Crop Protection business. We got the full and unrestricted registration in North America for Isoclast insecticide, which will allow us now to start to ramp that product as we go into 2020. Your question on what are the big ones that we\u2019re waiting on, I\u2019d say the one that would kind of be at the top of my list right now would be Conkesta, which is the protein for aboveground insect control in Brazil. And from like in-country cultivation perspective, that product is ready to go. What we\u2019re really waiting on is that really important China as well as European grain import tolerance. And in my conversations with folks that are involved in that trade negotiations with China, we know that these traits are on the list and have been discussed as opportunities once a trade deal gets finalized, there\u2019s an opportunity for China to go ahead and approve the import of those, and that would really give us the green light. So that\u2019s really it. We\u2019ve got another \u2013 number of other, small or minor registrations that we\u2019re still tracking, but we feel really good about the status of that regulatory portfolio and our teams around the world are executing really well. Maybe I\u2019ll ask Greg to take the cash flow question? Greg Friedman : Yes. Sure. Thanks, Jeff. The cash flow conversion ratio that we\u2019re targeting is above 50% and that should be \u2013 and we plan to achieve that in 2020 as our cash flow normalizes. As you would expect, in 2019, we did have some onetime cash needs that are reflected, regarding our spend as well as our integration. Those are one-time cash uses that will be completed in 2019. So moving to 2020, we should see a more normalized cash flow. We will have some seasonality in our cash flow, just driven by our industry. But we are targeting that 50% cash conversion ratio. Operator : Our next question will come from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Jeremy Rosenberg : This is Jeremy Rosenberg on for Vincent. Thanks for taking my question. I want to start on Seed. If we expect yields to be lower, let\u2019s say, in the U.S. maybe there\u2019s going to be more demand in LATAM. I mean some kind of pull forward the demand in North America in the fourth quarter. Just looking at your existing Seed inventories, whatever is produced this year, are you at all worried about a potential shortfall in Seed production in the U.S. that could potentially force you to do some winter production in South America? And just more generally, how are you thinking about your Seed production cost into next year, just given these moving parts? Thanks. Jim Collins : Great. Thanks for that question. You\u2019re right. The early part of this season as we were working to shore up our planting plans and working with key growers across the North American market to kind of nail down acres and get our production \u2013 kind of our production plants up and running. The good news about kind of our approach is, we\u2019ve been doing this a long time, and we have a pretty broad footprint of production facilities kind of across North America. So as we saw those early rains starting, I can\u2019t say enough about our production team and how quickly they were able to relocate acres out of some of the hardest-hit states, Indiana, Illinois, even that Western Ohio area where we\u2019re pretty hard hit. And that allowed us to go in favor Seed production markets where we can take some of those extremes out of play. And \u2013 so we\u2019ve got good footprint in Nebraska, Iowa and other markets. So at this point right now, we feel like we\u2019ve got the right amount of Seed in the ground for production, given where we think the market will turn out to be in 2020. And our early monitoring would suggest that the quality of that production is about where we would expect it to be. And so right now, we\u2019re not factoring in any big changes to our cost of goods on the Seed side, going into 2020, except maybe for the commodity price impact that might flow through. And in terms of winter production, right now we don\u2019t see any need or any plans to do that. But part of the reason why we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need that in corn is we\u2019ll have some carryover. We got returns back early enough. We got it into storage to help protect the germination rate. And so that will allow us to make sure we\u2019ve got some additional quantities of Seed beyond our production out there. And on soybeans, we were right on top of the season there. So we feel good about where we\u2019re sitting. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Thank you. Yes. I wanted drill into seed pricing a bit. How much was soybean seed pricing down year-over-year? And what\u2019s driving this? Is this just a mix shift down the price card? Or is this competitive dynamics between the various oversight tolerance traits that are out there that could actually worsen with the entrance of Enlist E3? Jim Collins : Yes, Steve. Thanks for the question. So North America, obviously, was a really tough market. And as we \u2013 as the season unfolded. And so you had a few dynamics going on there. You did \u2013 we did have that weather affects, replant rates, seed that we were swapping out as we tried to help with maturity ranges. And so you see some of that effect clearly in our corn pricing. On soybeans, the key \u2013 one of the key factors there was a really strong competitive environment that unfolded as you had quantities of seed out chasing fewer and fewer acres as that season unfolded. And we feel pretty good about the way we performed but we also felt like we needed to meet some of that competition, some of that demand to essentially hold where we are in the marketplace. The A-Series soybeans performance continues to be kind of at the top of the pack in terms of the comparisons. And we feel really good about the competitive side of that from the product performance. So we weren\u2019t going to let a lot of acres walk away from us. And then the other thing we talked about in our results is, we actually have a little more of our soybean business left report as we had seed deliveries that occurred into first part of the third quarter and you know from our revenue-recognition approach that we deliver \u2013 when we deliver seed, we report that revenue. I\u2019ve got Tim Glenn here with me obviously, our \u2013 Head of our Commercial Teams, and he was right out there in the middle of all that. Tim, you got anything else us to add? Tim Glenn : Yes. Jim. I think you hit on many of the big points. But I\u2019d emphasize that last fall we had really exceptional product performance with our A-Series soybean. So we had strong demand. One thing you\u2019ve got to remember, when we were actively selling soybeans in the season, farmers were at a really difficult spot. Soybeans were really out of favor and a lot of uncertainty because that was kind of maybe the most severe impact from the trade disruption. So it was a tough environment. We definitely had some aggressive competitive actions. And I think part of that was a result of some of the \u2013 really strong performance that we saw on our product line. And I would emphasize one other part is, it was a tough production season for us. And so we ended up selling more, what I would describe as, reduced quality soybean. So that we had to make a price concession on that. So we definitely felt competitive pressure. We definitely had a difficult environment in terms of farmer\u2019s attitude towards soybeans. But that \u2013 the fact that we did have to sell some lower germination beans and make a price concession impacted our price. The one my thing I would emphasize is, from a technology adoption, we didn\u2019t see farmers trade down on technology. We saw them sticking with our leader products. And our technology mix actually ended up very close to what we had anticipated. So we didn\u2019t see necessarily a behavioral change from farmers but it was definitely a challenging season on multiple fronts for soybeans. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Don Carson : Jim, a couple of questions on corn. This was the first year of your new, multichannel strategy in North America in corn. What was the impact of this change in channel strategy? Did you see an increase in share? And given how big you are in \u2013 with the Pioneer brand in terms of going direct to growers, you must have a pretty good feel for what actual acres are? Some of the fertilizer companies are talking about acreage planted as low as 85 million to 87 million and maybe a snap back to 95 million next year. Would you agree with that assessment? Jim Collins : Yes. I\u2019ll start with your \u2013 second part of your question and maybe, I\u2019ll toss it over to Tim to talk about the multichannel results here. So on acreage, you\u2019re right, with our Pioneer brand, we do get a good sense of what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s really hard for us to talk about that number, we\u2019re still waiting on USDA survey data. They\u2019ve gone out and decided that they wanted to completely resurvey because some of their information coming in didn\u2019t make sense. And a lot of that is caught up between the actual what was planted versus their intentions to plant versus previous year. So we\u2019re sort of trying to sort through what is the basis that we\u2019re working off of here, is it intention? If I just keep it really simple and I think about what was planted last year versus this year. In corn, we could be down a couple of million acres year-over-year. I think when it all sorted out, there were strong intentions early. But when it actually settled, I think we could be down just a couple of million or so, a few million. And in soybeans, again, we still have a little bit of business to finish up here as we closed out the first part of the third quarter. So we\u2019re still getting data on that. But we could be down as much maybe as 10% in soybeans, which will be helpful around carryover and other things like that. So \u2013 but it\u2019s still too early to really call it, and we\u2019re all waiting to see what USDA says here in a couple of days. And then, Tim, do you want to talk about multichannel a little bit? Tim Glenn : Yes, I will. Don, good question. The \u2013 how \u2013 what I\u2019d emphasize is, we \u2013 as we went into the season, we were going through a very insignificant reorganization of our regional brands, that multichannel approach. And \u2013 so we reduced the number of brands, we did some consolidation and that created disruption in the marketplace in terms of existing relationships in terms of dealers and customers. We had anticipated that we would lose some volume through that process. And I would describe what's happened through the process is very consistent or maybe even a little bit better than we had anticipated in terms of retention of our dealer network as well as retention of customers. So I think it's going well. On the retail side, this year was really about preparation for the future. So, we were actively repositioning the Mycogen brand in retail. Part of that process is kind of turning over the product portfolio, and we're mid step from that. Last week, I had the opportunity to participate in a kickoff meeting with several of our key channel partners at the western Corn Belt there at Johnston and we were in \u2013 we were kind of reintroducing the Mycogen brand to them, sharing what our plans for the future are for the brand. We introduced 42 new hybrids, so really excited about the products that we're putting on the table for them, and also working on building our business plans for 2020. So, 2019 was really a transition year for Mycogen and 2020 is about really going out there and aggressively ramping up in the channel as we build that brand. And the thing I would emphasize is, as we think about 2019 and how the Seed here turned out, we've had very good insight, as you say, into kind of our relationship with farmers. We felt very comfortable how our order activity for both corn and soybeans have proceeded throughout the year. And as we went through the changes in the spring, obviously a lot of farmers, they were switching hybrids, potentially switching crops or flat-out going into prevented planting. We feel comfortable with how things have turned out. So we have a good understanding of the numerator when you talk about share, the denominator is a little uncertain right now but we feel like we've fared very well through the transition this spring and all the changes. And I think that direct relationship with farmers really played out in our favor. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Joel Jackson : Hi, good morning. One of your Seed competitors was talking about a bit of a price compression in some of the Xtend premiums. Could you give us a little bit of update on what you're seeing on pricing for Xtend? And maybe how that will carry through for pricing for E3? Thanks. Jim Collins : Thanks, Joel, for the question. Great to hear from you. We were talking a moment ago about pricing and competitive pressures that went on in the market. And it really was about, kind of, tied to that whole Xtend portfolio. So \u2013 and we feel good about our conversions, we feel good about our product performance. And as we've talked before, we're about 65% or so of lineup converted over to that. So when I look overall kind of at soybean pricing, we were probably down 0.1% kind of year-over-year and that is a direct response to that competition that was going on in that market. So hard for me to talk about kind of what \u2013 where others were, what motivations were. But I can tell you we have some of the best-performing products in our A-Series lineup. And that really allowed us, I think, to hold our own in a lot of cases when things got really tight.  And then on your pricing around Enlist, it's a little early for us to be talking about how we're going to price that product. We \u2013 we've got some great demonstration going on out in the marketplace. We have a lot of really strong pent-up farmer demand that's coming to us about their excitement about the system, and we'll take a fresh look at that here at the year-end and compare that to, okay, what varieties are we going to have available, what are their performance attributes in terms of yields and Seed packages that will be on board. And then we'll set the price accordingly along with all the benefits that the Enlist system brings in terms of convenience, ease of use, peace of mind, those type of things. Operator : We'll go next to Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Christopher Parkinson : Thank you. Just given the optimism for 2020 that everybody's talking about. Just how should we think for the potential sets on your 4Q order book versus what will actually end up boosting 2020? On one hand, I think we're facing a very tight fall application, which may limit preliminary decision making. But on the other, farmers are naturally going to what the best hybrids as early as possible and lock those in. So I know it's tough to calibrate, but just any initial thoughts on this evolution will be appreciated. Thank you. Jim Collins : Thanks, Chris. Yes, as we think about the second half of 2019, we've factored in, what we believe, is an appropriate level of \u2013 we've got some great tailwinds coming from product pipelines. We've still got synergies to deliver it at the end of the year. And that is then tempered by some concerns that as this season will very naturally go long, just because everything got in late and farmers are going to \u2013 they'll keep crops in the ground as long as they possibly can to milk as minute degree days right out to the end as possible. And that could close windows that would allow for fall-applied Crop Protection as well as nitrogen product.  So \u2013 but we feel like we've called that right, and that's the second half that we've outlooked basically around sales \u2013 about reported sales down about 3% versus previous year. And it puts us on a full year basis of about flat when you look at just price volume. So we think we've got that dialed in. In terms of cost for setup for 2020, and question earlier was about, if you have any issues around winter production, we don't think so, we think we've got the right seed in the right place for what we're going to need for 2020. And then all the other reasons why we might see a return to something more normal in North America Operator : Our next question will come from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Jonas Oxgaard : Hi, good morning guys. Two parter on Enlist, if you don\u2019t mind. The first one is just a technical. What is a unit? And how many of those do you sell in total? But then the real question is, what kind of pricing did you see on Enlist so far, premium over the other varieties? And do you expect that to maintain or improve next year? Jim Collins : Great. Yes, Jonas, a unit that we talk about, that\u2019s a bag of seed. In corn 80,000 kernels, in soybeans\u2026 Greg Friedman : 140,000. Jim Collins : 140,000 kernels are seeds per bag. And in soybeans, a unit of one bag of soybean seed will plant about one acre of field. So the seed industry typically talks in terms of units. It\u2019s a standardizing way to talk about our lineup and our products. And when it comes to product lineup, maybe I\u2019ll start. But I\u2019ll ask Rajan or Tim \u2013 maybe Rajan to say a few words. We\u2019re clearly in the mode right now of exploring the integration of that trait into the elite Pioneer and Corteva germplasm that we have in house due to the timing of the merge and any trust windows. We were sort of precluded from having any really good conversations and understanding of that technology until the deal closed last \u2013 in September of 2018, so we \u2013 2017. So we really have \u2013 now just had this one first good season to take a strong look at that. And so as we begin to ramp in 2020, we\u2019ll utilize germplasm that that Dow already had, that our scientists had and had began that work in the Mycogen brand. Some of our partners out there are \u2013 the other regional brands have had a look at that and had begun working with it, and we\u2019ve got some partnerships with others there we can in-license technology for a few years until we can get that breeding engine that everybody really knows and respects out there in the market. So we can get that breeding engine up and running and start those conversions. So we might go through a couple of years where you\u2019re going to see a Corteva branded, Pioneer, Mycogen branded lineup in Enlist that won\u2019t compete with the elitist of products that are out there, but it won\u2019t take as long to get right back up on that curve. I don\u2019t know. Rajan, anything else you\u2019d add? Rajan Gajaria : So, Jim, I think you\u2019ve covered it. Just a couple of things to add. One is, Jonas, just do want to reinforce the importance of Enlist as a system. So when we think about our product lineup, we need to talk about our [indiscernible] chemistry, and they\u2019re very excited about that. From a capacity standpoint, the product is working very well in the field for cotton, as you know. From a germplasm perspective, Jim covered it. I think really, we\u2019ve got top-quality germplasm. We\u2019re progressing Enlist with that and even the partnership that we have with MS Tech I did want to reinforce. We get very good quality germplasm, working with our partner, MS Tech. So excited about the entire system. The portfolio that we will be able to bring to the market and seeing how we can ramp up enlist starting next year. Operator : And our final question will come from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Thank you. Can you hear me? Jim Collins : Yes. Good morning, John. John Roberts : Good morning. Last night, on the results for CF Industries, they indicated the damage to the U.S. corn market spend so unprecedented that it could take more than one-year for the U.S. markets to recover? I don't know if you would agree with that, that maybe we are headed for a couple of year\u2019s above-average planting and maybe above-average trend on pricing for the foreign input market? Jim Collins : It\u2019s a great question John. We\u2019ve seen years before where we had maybe not as late and as big a decline as we saw in 2019. And I've seen the next year every bit is good, if not even better. So given the amount of work that growers have done to improve drainage and the equipments that they have and the performance of our products, it feels like to me that almost every year, short of anything on the downstream market demand side of all of this, it feels like that we've got a lot of capacity and a lot of capability. And there's a little bit of land, I would say, in that Nebraska market where you had the horrific flooding and you had some sandy \u2013 some sand that got up out of the rivers and kind of got into some pretty good farmland and growers are working hard to try to save that. But when you think about that total of all the millions of acres that are out there, you won't really feel that piece nearly as much. So I would say, no, I would believe that this market could come right back to where it has been previously and it's really just a function of how many acres go in the ground and the yield that will able to get out of those acres. Megan Britt : So \u2013 just I wanted to let you know that we can take another question. Jim Collins : Okay. We probably have time for one more question. Operator : Great. And that will come from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. Jim Collins : Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. Thank you for taking my question. Good morning Jim and Greg and Megan. Just a quick question on CPCs you mentioned high inventories and pricing pressure. I mean have you already seen that pricing pressure? Or do you think that is yet to come for the next season? And then secondly for Rajan, how big is your seed treatment business today? And how big you think it can get? Thank you. Jim Collins : Great, P.J., yes. So on Crop Protection Chemistries, clearly, inventories in North America are going to be a little bit elevated just because we didn't create the pull through on those early spring-applied chemistries as well as \u2013 we've got a really strong business in the nitrogen-fixing area. So on inventories and quantities and volumes, we'd say, we're probably a little elevated going into the fourth quarter. And we've dialed in the fact that if acres go long and late, you may not get some of that late-season prep work that growers have traditionally tried to do to maybe take some of the heat off of the spring season, get some fall-applied chemistry that goes out and get the fall-applied nitrogen and our nitrogen-fixation products. But we think we've got that dialed in about right for our outlook. The thing about price, if I think about the rest of world, we had a great start in Latin America, channel inventories there don't appear to be elevated and are right about where they need to be. And you look at our results in rest of the world, we have some pretty strong overall performance. And when I think about value and pricing and how that business really turned out pricing Crop Protection was about flat for us globally and cut me up mid single-digits, if you just look at the rest of the world. So overall value there. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of the question? P.J. Juvekar: Seed treatment? Jim Collins : Yes. Seed treatment. Rajan, you want to talk a little bit about our seed treatment business. Rajan Gajaria : Yes. I just mentioned that. Very exciting actually, I think, seed treatment continuing to grow. We are expecting more than a double-digit growth this year and the first half, we have seen that growth across the globe but definitely pronounced in Latin America. And \u2013 so very excited about that, P.J. And just building on Jim's point about pricing, where we see the new products being launched, we are able to capture value in all parts of the globe and North America, given the market dynamics, it was tough but I think there is cautious optimism on Crop Protection pricing across the globe. For example, if you see Asia Pacific, the products of Spinosyn, which we are seeing there, they have seen as much as 10%, 11% price increase, a double-digit price increase, as a data point. So where there is value for new, differentiated product across Crop Protection, across the globe, we are seeing price increases. Megan Britt : So that\u2019s our last question for this conference call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. Operator : That does conclude our conference for today.

And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Megan Britt. Please go ahead ma\u2019am. Megan Britt : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the third quarter 2019 earnings conference call for Corteva Agriscience. The call is available to investors and media via webcast. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our comments during this call. These slides are posted on the Investor Relations section of Corteva website and through the link to our webcast. Speaking on the call today are Jim Collins, Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Friedman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Rajan Gajaria, Executive Vice President of Business Platform; and Tim Glenn, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer will join the Q&A session at the end of the call. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future. I direct you to Slides 2 and 3 of our earnings release for our forward-looking statement disclaimers. All statements that address expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current expectations that are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainty regarding assumptions. We urge you to review our SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause material differences and actual results. We are providing information on a pro forma basis, prepared in conformity with regulation FX to provide the most meaningful comparison. So please take note of the pro forma basis discussion in our earnings release and slides. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items, which can be found in the schedules that accompany our earnings release. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure were available and other associated disclosures are contained in our earnings release and on our website. Turning to the agenda for the call today, Jim will review highlights for the third quarter including progress on our priorities for our shareholder value creation, results by region and key drivers of second half and full year operating EBITDA. Greg will then review our third quarter financial results in more detail including segment performance highlights and a comprehensive lock of operating earnings per share. Following this review, we will take your questions before concluding the call. With that introduction, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Collins : Thank you, Megan, and thank you to everyone joining the call and online. Earlier today, we reported third quarter results for Corteva delivering solid earnings improvement relative to the prior year despite the emergence of currency headwinds in Latin America and additional weather related impacts in several key regions. As we consider the market backdrop for this quarter, uncertainty regarding North America yield production and ending stock levels for the 2019 season has persisted as an unprecedented planting season has now given a way to an extraordinarily that late harvest. To some extent large carryover supplies have moderated market reaction to North American production problems, especially as markets expected Latin America to respond to elevated commodity prices with additional production. However, recent planting progress reports from Brazil where markets were poised for a strong row crop season indicate lack of rainfall is delaying soybean planting, which may have an impact on the timing and size of the second crop or safrinha. Coupled with production disruptions and delays, recent softening in the Chinese economy, African swine fever and slower growth in other emerging markets are impacting the demand outlook for commodity grains and oilseeds. On trade, while China has resumed purchases of some U.S. agricultural products, the timing of a full resolution is still unknown. In the face of this considerable market turmoil, our teams have remained focused on the levers in our control, taking self-help actions and driving execution in the marketplace, while setting the stage for a solid 2020 when we expect more normal conditions to arrive in many sectors of the ag markets. Now, as we did last quarter, we would like to start our update today with some longer term perspective where we can look beyond the market uncertainty that has continued to challenge our day to day operations to evaluate the progress we are making as a company relative to our priorities for shareholder value creation, noted on Slide 5. As I said last quarter, these priorities continue to guide our strategic actions and underscore the quality of results we are working to achieve, particularly as we work dynamically to adjust to short-term market disruptions, starting first on culture. We highlighted the launch of Execute to Win last quarter. With this, we are establishing an owner mindset for all employees to drive the culture reinforcement that is needed to deliver and sustain our gains long-term. So far we've engaged more than 25% of our employee base in the initiative identification, planning and execution that we expect will ultimately contribute $500 million in incremental operating EBITDA over the next five years. On capital allocation, we remain committed to delivering cash to shareholders in the form of quarterly dividends and share repurchases, while continuing to invest in innovation and growth. In June, we announced the authorization of a share buyback program to return $1 billion to shareholders, which we expect to complete over the next year three years. This quarter, we've purchased $25 million in shares. Additionally, Corteva paid its first quarterly dividends of $0.13 per share on September 13 and has declared its second continuous quarterly dividend payable on December 18. In total, our actions so far will return approximately $220 million in cash to shareholders by the end of the year. On a priority related to developing innovative solutions, we delivered over $30 million in operating improvements from new products in the quarter, consistent with our commitment to deliver over $100 million in improvements in the second half and greater than $150 million for the full year. Crop protection and new product sales increased 56% versus the same period last year and are on track to grow to 12% of our overall crop protection sales by the end of the year. Products driving net sales and operating EBITDA improvement in the quarter included PowerCore Ultra in Seed and Arylex herbicides, Vessarya fungicides and Isoclast insecticides in crop protection. We continue to see momentum in our crop protection portfolio with notable geographic label expansions for Arylex and Rinskor herbicides, Isoclast insecticide and Zorvec fungicide this quarter. On our priority around best-in-class cost structure, we delivered $100 million in cost synergies in the quarter and are on track to deliver approximately $150 million in cost synergies for the second half of 2019. Overall, we have now realized cumulative cost savings through the end of this quarter of $800 million out of the $1.2 billion commitment expected by 2021. Finally, seasonal shifts during the period and currency obscure several positive signs of operational momentum. Based on the current USDA acres, we are confident that we gain share in Pioneer brand corn and soybeans in North America. We also gained share in summer corn in Brazil and insecticides and fungicides globally. Further in support of our growth in the Spinosyn insecticides, we announced today a project approved by the board of directors to add manufacturing capacity are key Spinosyn insecticide products to release supply constraints and grow our leadership in natural products aligned with our market growth expectations in insecticides and natural products over the mid-term horizon. Moving to Slide 6 and a few highlights of our key performance indicators for the quarter. Net sales on a reported basis decreased 2% versus the prior period, primarily due to currency. Organic sales were flat for the quarter as weather drove offsetting shifts at the segment level. As we reported last quarter, market disruptions due to the weather in North America delayed planting and shifted seed sales into the third quarter, while strong early demand moved crop protection volume for Latin America into the second quarter. Further pressuring third quarter performance, a lack of seasonal rainfall in Brazil delayed soybean planting and crop protection applications, shifting crop protecting volumes into the fourth quarter primarily for Vessarya fungicide. Our operating EBITDA improved 18% compared to prior year, largely driven by the margin benefit from the shift of seed volumes and the continued realization of cost synergies. Demand for new crop protection products also resulted in margin expansion in the quarter, which helped to partially offset the more than $40 million hit to quarter from currency. Margin declines from higher corn and soybean replants and the seasonal shifts of Latin America crop protection volumes due to early demand coupled with the delayed seasonal rains, further pressured operating EBITDA results for the quarter. For North America, when we exclude the impact of replant and despite the mixed shift we experienced to shorter maturity products, we held corn price in our Pioneer brand. We have reduced selling, general and administrative and R&D costs 2% in the quarter on a net basis due to cost synergies as well as the discretionary actions taken to curtail spending. Our Slide 7 shows third quarter highlights by region. North America sales improved 16% for the third quarter due to weather related planting delays that shifted seed sales corn and soybeans into the period. While seed sales were up 102% compared to prior year, crop protection sales declined 7% as both delayed planting and delayed harvest impacted the timing of fertilizer and crop protection applications. Historically slow 2019 planting season in the U.S. has contributed to delays in harvest, fall field preparation and fall fertilizer applications. The most recent crop progress report indicated that only 41% of the U.S. corn and 62% of the U.S. soybeans were harvested. For corn this percent harvested is the fourth slowest in the last 39 years and the soybean percent harvested is the sixth lowest. Delayed planting and now harvest have contributed to elevated channel inventories and crop protection combined with large distributor inventory reduction initiatives restocking rates have slowed delay in the timing of fall crop protection sales. While harvest slowly progresses, momentum is building in North America for the 2020 season. Our seed pricing for the 2020 North America season was released to our sales teams in September and demonstrates our confidence in the strength of our new product performance. We price for the value created by new technology and we provide growers\u2019 choice with high-performing seed offerings delivered through our multi-channel multi-brand approach. We are preparing for an aggressive ramp of Qrome corn products, which are expected to be approximately 20% of our lineup in 2020 and the launch of Lumialza seed treatment, our new proprietary bio-based nematicide, which will be launched in the Pioneer brand. In corn, considering the mix benefit from new technology, we expect to drive low single-digit price gains year-over-year in our Pioneer and multi-channel brands. We are also expanding the Enlist E3 soybean offerings in our commercial product lineup next year and expect the technology will penetrate 10% of the market. On price for soybeans, we expect to be flat due to continued market competitiveness. Moving to Latin America, reported and organic net sales declined for the quarter, largely due to the impact of weather related volume shifts in crop protection and currency. As we noted last quarter, the strong early demand shifted approximately $80 million in sales that would normally have occurred in the third quarter into the second quarter. The delay of seasonal rains in Brazil in the third quarter slowed the soybean planting progress and resulted in the shift of approximately $15 million in expected crop protection sales into the fourth quarter, primarily from the bizarre of fungicide. Seed reported net sales up 7% for the third quarter in Latin America, largely due to the year-over-year price improvement. Strong performance of Leptra and PowerCore Ultra corn products drove a 14% year-over-year increase in seed price. Seed volumes were down for the quarter due to the lack of seasonal rain delaying summer planting progress and input purchases in preparation for the safrinha season. We are paying close attention to the development of the crop season in Brazil as continued challenges may impact planting : crop protection applications, crop input technology selections and the size of the safrinha corn crop. We have also been following the presidential elections in Argentina and the decline of the Argentine peso, which has lost 35% of its value against the dollar as of the quarter-end compared to the start of the year. Approximately 20% of our Latin American net sales come from Argentina and we are relatively insulated from the currency devaluation as sales are predominantly done in U.S. dollars. However, government policies unfavorable to agriculture will impact our outlook for 2020 and beyond. In Asia Pacific organic next sales were down 6% due to drought and key countries in the region, which significantly lowered planting and treated acres and drove lower crop protection volumes in the region for the quarter. Deep reported net sales were up 19% year-over-year on strong volume in corn in Philippines and improved pricing in India due to high demand for other crops. Finishing up with Europe, Middle East and Africa up 3% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic basis. Continued increased demand for new crop protection products like Arylex cereal herbicides contributed to growth in crop protection sales for the region in the quarter. In seed declines in canola due to drought conditions in North and Central Europe impacted volumes. Firstly, devaluation in the region lowered overall sales growth by 5%. Recent regulatory developments in Europe, particularly the announced ban of Chlorpyrifos insecticide in several countries have not had a meaningful impact on the quarter. We are still quantifying the impact to 2020 but expect the impact for all regulatory challenged products to be only $10 million and offset by expanded registrations for new crop protection products like Arylex and Rinskor herbicides and Zorvec fungicides. So now I'll turn to Slide 8 and cover the drivers of our operating EBITDA for the second half and full-year 2019. Last quarter we shared our expectation to deliver operating EBITDA about breakeven for the second half. Due to further negative impact from currency operating EBITDA is now expected to be a loss of $70 million compared to the same period last year, which is the lower-end of the previous range. Currency, particularly the devaluation of the Brazilian real is expected to reduce second half results by about $80 million overall. Other drivers that we outlined last quarter as part of our second half guidance are on track to deliver. Due to the late North America season we recognize seed revenues in the third quarter, which offset the crop protection volumes that shifted into the second quarter due to the early demand for products in Latin America. We continue to expect strong price improvements year-over-year on supply constraint, high demand products primarily in our insect management portfolio and we expect to have year-over-year improvement in Latin America largely due to the expansion of new products like the Zorvec fungicides, as well as Leptra and PowerCore Ultra corn products. We have also maintained our momentum to deliver additional cost savings from synergies in the second half, targeted to deliver over $150 million in incremental savings, which will bring our annual incremental savings to $350 million. In total the second half guidance represents an approximate $130 million or 65% improvement over the prior year. Full-year pro forma operating EBITDA is now expected to be about $1.9 billion, the low-end of the previous range and down about 8% versus 2018. We are affirming the full-year indication for net sales as a decline of roughly 3% predominantly owned currency headwinds. On an organic basis we still expect sales to be about flat year-over-year. Before I turn the call over to Greg, I'll summarize by commending our teams around the globe for an extraordinary effort in the quarter to support our customers in the face of numerous challenges. Corteva about achieved solid earnings improvement relative to the prior year and made ongoing progress on our priorities for shareholder value creation. We remain focused on driving operational discipline and committed to setting the stage or solid net sales and operating earnings growth in 2020. With that I'll turn it over to Greg. Greg Friedman : Thank you, Jim. Turning now to Slide 9 for a summary of our third quarter results. Please note that the prior year period is on a pro forma basis for operating EBITDA and operating earnings per share. As Jim covered 2019 continues to be a very dynamic and complex operating environment, particularly in North America and Latin America, which was evident in our third quarter results. Net sales of $1.9 billion were down 2% versus prior year on a 3% increase in volumes offset by 3% decline in local price and a 2% headwind from currency. North America volumes were up 31% in the quarter as a result of soybean and corn sale that shifted from the prior quarter due to delayed planting. Offsetting this was the early demand we experienced for crop protection products in Latin America in the prior quarter and delays in the Brazil soybean season which shifted expected crop protection sales into the fourth quarter. Local price was impacted by competitive pricing pressure in North America soybeans. Higher replant in soybeans and corn and the impact of grower incentive discounts in North America. Turning to operating EBITDA we reported a loss of $207 million, which was an 18% improvement versus the prior year period on a pro forma basis. Overall improvement was driven by favorable timing shifts in North America seed sale and roughly $100 billion in cost savings from synergies that we delivered during the period. These were partially offset by shifts in crop protection sales in Latin America and currency with a headwind. We delivered expansion in our overall operating EBITDA margin in the quarter as a result of the timing shifts we discussed earlier and cost synergies recognized during the period. All in all operating EBITDA margin improved by more than 200 basis points led by our seed segment, this translated into a loss of $0.39 for operating earnings per share, up 35% from the third quarter 2018 on a pro forma basis. Turning to Slide 10 for a year-over-year comparison of our operating earnings per share. Realized cost savings from synergies contributed $0.14 to operating EPS in the quarter. Well, volume contributed $0.08 of improvement primarily due to the sales shifts in seed and new product sales we delivered in the quarter. A $0.12 headwind on pricing and cost was a product of increased replant in soybeans and corn and increased grower incentive discount coupled with higher commissions and new product launch costs. Currency was a $0.06 headwind in the quarter. In addition, tax was a benefit of $0.04 cents. Our base tax rate for the quarter was 11.8% up from the third quarter 2018 rate of 2.4%. Lastly, we generated $0.13 of benefit primarily from foreign exchange gains related to our hedging programs to offset exposures for the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liability that we carry on our balance sheet. Turning to our segment results, Slide 11 highlights the performance for the quarter in both our crop protection and seed segments. In crop protection, net sales were $1.2 billion for the quarter, down 12% from the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to an 11% organic decline, predominantly from volume shifts in Latin America coupled with a 1% headwind from currency. Crop protection operating EBITDA was $119 million for the quarter, down 25% from the prior year period. Volume declines in Latin America, grower incentive discounts in North America, new product launch costs and currency drove the decline in operating EBITDA while the segment continued to deliver on cost synergies. In seed, we reported net sales of $681 million for the quarter, which is up 24% from the same period last year. Higher sales were principally from a 31% increase in volumes as a result of the weather related delays in North America, which shifted seed sales from the second quarter into the third quarter. Local price was a headwind, up 5% in the quarter due to higher replant in soybeans and corn in North America Currency was a headwind of 2%. Seed operating EBITDA was a loss of $295 million and improvement of almost $80 million over the prior year period. Our results reflect the shift of soybeans and corn sales in North America and continued progress on cost savings recognized in the quarter. Unfavorable local price impacted by replant and currency headwinds partially offset the year-over-year volume improvement. Seed operating EBITDA margin improved by almost 25 percentage points. Turning now to Slide 12 and an update on our modeling guidance, including a bridge of operating EBITDA to operating earnings per share for the full year 2019. Touching first on net sales, we continue to expect to be down about 3% over prior year unchanged from prior guidance. This is due to unfavorable currency. Organic sales are essentially flat. We now expect depreciation expense to be approximately $575 million, and interest expense to be about $100 million for the year based on our current forecast. We have updated our estimate on exchange losses net of tax, which reflects our full-year estimates for the cost of the program now expect a $70 million to $80 million loss for the year. Based on the $1.9 billion operating EBITDA guidance for the year, this translates into an operating earnings per share range of $1.20 per share to $1.26 per share, at a midpoint of $1.23 per share. This represents about $0.04 improvement over the midpoint of our prior guidance on operating earnings per share. Before I turn the call back to Megan, I want to touch on the directional targets we provided for 2020 operative EBITDA back in August. We remain committed to executing against our cost synergies and productivity programs that we outline and fully expect to deliver on those targets in 2020. You will recall in August that we started anticipated headwinds of approximately $100 million for the next year and we continue to monitor market conditions that may alter that estimate. We are evaluating planted acres and costs for the next year. It is too early to provide definitive guidance. Our focus is still on delivering a solid year of growth in both net sales and operating EBITDA for 2020. We will provide more definitive guidance during our fourth quarter call and I look forward to sharing more at that time. We\u2019ll now turn the call back to Megan to open the Q&A. Megan Britt : Thank you, Greg. With that, let's move on to your questions. I'd like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both in our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instruction. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Jim and Greg just on your 2020 guidance, you initially called out normalizing North American marketing conditions about $250 million. Is that still on track? And how is that into play with the $100 million plus perhaps of other headwinds you might see for next year due to a planted acreage shifting? Thank you. Greg Friedman : Yes. Thanks David. This is Greg. You're right. In August, we updated our midterm targets for 2020 and included some expectations related to North America. Related to that we\u2019re monitoring several factors that will influence our 2020 outlook. But we feel that that $250 million is still a reasonable estimate. We're still planning on things like cost synergies, additional productivity, new products consistent with our indications in August and we're closely monitoring some elements here that we considered headwinds such as currency, trade negotiations, channel inventories, planted area, regulatory actions and things like that. There is a couple other elements here that I think would be helpful like \u2013 like maybe Rajan you can provide some color on seed production. Rajan Gajaria : Sure. Thanks for talking, Greg. No, excited about 2020, there is obviously a lot going on here with new product launches et cetera. But to answer the specific question, Greg, on the seed production, one of the biggest drivers for headwinds for seed production next year is the commodity prices. As we look at the commodity prices have increased year-over-year and that's being factored in. Harvests are delayed across the mid-west like we know and so we are looking at what the yield impact of that could be as we go in. But overall I would say that we are really excited about 2020 and the delivery of the $250 million that we have discussed in August. Like Greg said. Jim Collins : David, its Jim. Obviously complex market that we're looking towards, I think Greg did a nice job of summarizing all the elements. I'll reinforce that pipeline delivery going forward. You've heard a lot about from, we\u2019ll have a list out there. We're ramping up the products we launched this year, like Pyraxalt in Asia and Zorvec in Europe and Isoclast our newest insecticide. All the items that we've talked about probably the one area that that will have the biggest impact on 2020 will obviously be planted area. And so maybe to close off this question, maybe ask Tim to just give a little insight on what we're seeing out there in the field around kind of expectations for 2020. Tim Glenn : Thanks, Jim and good morning David. Well, as we look at 2020 in terms of the planted area in North America, I think the expectation we should have is that we'll return two more of a normal level and so that that would imply something in the neighborhood of about 11 million acres that would come back into production on corn and soy. And from that point when you determine the next critical thing is the mix between corn and soy. And so where we monitor closely the ratio between soybeans and corn prices \u2013 commodity prices and today that sit somewhere in the neighborhood of around 2.4. And at that level it would imply that somewhere in the neighborhood of about one-third of that around 11 million acres would come back into corn with the balance going into soybean. So now note that is very dynamic and that\u2019s changing every day and over the course of weeks or months and between now and planting that can vary quite a lot and that's one of the real key indicators that we're looking at. So today that would \u2013 that's the implications we see. We monitor it every day and we'll continue to do that all the way until farmers make their final decisions. David Begleiter : Great. Thanks, Tim. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. You have a very dynamic cost reduction program, but there really hasn't been much change in SG&A costs year-over-year and I think your SG&A costs were even a little bit higher in the third quarter. Can you discuss why that's the case? And you also have negative currency translation. So you would think that those numbers would be lower. Are you spending more on the SG&A line in order to promote products? And so that's adding to your cost or are there other factors? Can you discuss those issues? Greg Friedman : Absolutely. Thanks, Jeff. This is Greg. So yes, when you look at our SG&A line on the income statement there are some non-operating costs included in that line item. So those non-operating costs in fact are up year-over-year and those are costs that are specifically related to our discontinued businesses. There are things like increased litigation costs or increased costs related to remediation \u2013 environmental remediation. So if you take \u2013 if you take that piece out, we're relatively flat to slightly up as you said in SG&A and the key driver of that in the third quarter is commissioned. Commissions are variable based on our revenue. So in particular proceed to see, so with our seed revenues going up on as significantly as they did in the third quarter, there's a proportional element that increased our commission expense. There's also another component of commissions that that did increase as well and that is some competitive rate increases that we implemented earlier at the beginning of this year to bring our commission structure up to market rates. So if you take those increases yet you also take into account the cost savings that we executed relative to our synergy. And then also on some reductions that you see on the corporate line item, net-net SG&A for the quarter was about flat to slightly up. Operator : Our next question will come from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson : Hi. Good morning. Maybe you could expand a bit about your guidance that you expect soybean price mix or soybean seed price mix up to be about flattish. You talk about maybe what's going on in the mix versus like-for-like pricing and some of the data points out there in the market from competitors on some of the \u2013 on the Enlist type pricing? Jim Collins : Yes, Joel, Let me start and then maybe I'll turn it to Tim. We launched our price cards here back in September, and so he's probably got the latest and greatest. But as we launched those cards, we expected overall prices to be flat to up slightly. But there are some \u2013 there are some downsides in those cards due to competitive competition that's out there, but we have some new technology that's mixed in there as well. So we see a lift going on. So all-in-all we feel really good about the performance, especially in our A series soybeans and so that's going to carry a lot of weight in our pricing movement going forward. But Tim, do you want to give a little more color on soybean pricing? Tim Glenn : Yes. Joel on the pricing, obviously it is value driven and that we're in the time of the year, right now where farmers are evaluating the products that they use this past year with delayed harvest that probably take a little bit longer than we typically see. And at the end of the day, they're going to evaluate what their best options are. We price for value. Our approach this year is to have roughly flat on soybeans, and that is the combination of some existing products in our lineup that maybe flat with year-over-year or possibly adjusted down a little bit, and then new varieties that come into our lineup really driving some upside and pricing opportunity. So it's a highly competitive market, no question. We're very blessed that we've got a strong portfolio of products in both the pioneer and multichannel brands. We've got the \u2013 I feel very confident that we are setting the pace in terms of product performance on the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend segment. We've got extremely strong demand for Enlist E3 technology and those Enlist E3 products are priced comparable to our leading varieties. And so it's a combination of many things primarily mixed driven that\u2019s going to allow us to hold price as we move into 2020. But you're exactly right. It's a highly competitive market as it always is and farmers are going to make their choice based off of what delivers the most value to them. Operator : We'll take our next question from Christopher Parkinson with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead. Christopher Parkinson : Great, thank you. There have obviously been a lot of moving parts in 2019, and just with the ag market FX, input volatility, weather, trade time lines, you name it. But can you just really just boil down the Corteva story into three to four primary reasons on why investors should focus on the stock? Is it projected market outperformance in Seed and CPC, the cost cuts, et cetera? Just what can you \u2013 do you believe your global team could do better? And what should we be talking about midyear in 2020? Just a few puts and takes would be appreciated. Jim Collins : Yes. Chris thanks for the question. As we said earlier obviously, we're monitoring a number of factors as we head into 2020. The first of those that Greg mentioned, and others asked about is the \u2013 kind of the way that the recovery in the market in North America. So first and foremost, you have to acknowledge, 2019 was an unprecedented year we have not seen in the industry in a long time. So as we more normalize and move into 202, we'll expect to see a lot of that come back. And that's in our core market. It's in North America. It's where we have our largest lineup. And so obviously, it affected us disproportionately than \u2013 and our business around the world. If you then strip out North America and look at rest of the world, 2019 has been an extraordinary year. Year-to-date, we've got our \u2013 different regions are \u2013 like Europe, Asia, Latin America they're all up organically 7%. We've got insecticides growth. Our entire insecticide portfolio year-to-date is up 9%. So you strip out just what happened in North America and you can really see the energy and the momentum in the rest of the world and behind the scenes. On top of that, and as we said, going into 2020 we're going to carry \u2013 continue to carry through on the cost synergy momentum that we've had. We have good line of sight and visibility as well as additional productivity actions that we have taken to really respond to the market conditions that are going on, so we can be in a better position to support our customers. And then third on that list is new products, where you've heard Tim talk about Enlist. We're excited about that lineup now, really hitting that hard. We'd expect Enlist to grow to be about 10% of the overall market. We've got chrome coming in; there's been a nice lift on chrome. And then there's a lineup of Crop Protection products like Arylex in Europe, one of the strongest new herbicides being launched in cereals, Rinskor for rice, Isoclast and Zorvec in specialty crops that are doing really well. So that pipeline has to be the third marquee element of that. So a recovery in North America, continued great momentum on cost synergies and additional productivity actions and then our new product pipeline. As we take a step back from the income statement and really look at where we're going to sit with our balance sheet, obviously, we've got a strong commitment to returning cash to shareholders. And we talked a lot about that in the past around the dividend announcement, but also a continued commitment as we go forward around an appropriate amount of share repurchases. So I think that is a pretty compelling story as to why Corteva's a great vote here going forward. Operator : Our next question will come from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning everyone. If I could just ask about the Pioneer share gains in corn and soy in the U.S. One, if you could size it for us, 0.5 point, 1 point something like that. And secondly, if you can kind of help us understand how much of that just came from pure outperformance of the product versus, obviously, a tricky season with different maturity changes and so forth, were you able to be more nimble than some of the smaller competitors to serve the farmers' needs at the last minute? I guess, what I'm trying to get at is how much of that share gain are you very comfortable you're going to carry into 2020 and build on versus how much could have just been some good execution in a challenging season. Jim Collins : Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Vincent. Thanks for that. We \u2013 really, we start with the \u2013 based on the current USDA acreage forecast that we have. It's kind of the best data we have. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we believe we have gained share in both corn and soybeans in North America. And that's that service \u2013 the high-service, high-touch approach I think, is part of that really shining through. The fact that we're with those growers in their fields and as this market unfolded, our ability to move products around and meet demand as appropriate. I think our team out there really, really shined. I think there's a performance element to that, and maybe I'll kick it to Tim here to give you a little more color on it. And then I did add that Brazil, I think, based on the current intended acres and external estimates that we get, we believe we've done really well in that summer corn market also. And I think, again, that's product performance, that's the lineup that we committed to as we've been really driving that. So Tim, do you want to add some other comments? Tim Glenn : No, I think you touched on it well, Jim. I mean, I \u2013 what I would highlight is, Vince, and I think the point is, you have to have strong product performance and you have to be able to go out and execute, and the two go together. And in the year like this, I mean, as we went through the entire call, the selling season up to the point of planning. We had very strong demand for products. And so coming off a really strong performance in 2018, we carried a lot of momentum on the product side, a lot of energy from our sales team. And so, we felt very good about where we were prior to sort of the season breaking and chaos ensuing. I think the fact that we were able to be there, our route model is definitely working in our advantage, our ability to go out there and serve customers as they were dealing with some of the adversity, potentially changing from one maturity to another at corn, evaluating other crop options that hustle, that execution definitely made a difference. And I think that it helped to translate into a strong finish for the year. What we carry into 2020? To me I think that those actions that we made this spring and into the summer that strengthens the relationship. We expect the customers are going to have a very positive experience with our product. Again, you know, coming off that high-level of service. We believe it's sustainable. And we have longstanding relationships with farmer customers and this only builds off of that. So it was a tough year at times. It felt like our sales team was not making a lot of progress just because so many changes and so much uncertainty, but tough year is when you really strengthen those relationships. And given that with our product performance really excited about what we carry into 2020. Operator : Our next question will come from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead. John Roberts : Thank you. I'm looking at Slide 15, specifically the pricing in the seed marketplaces. Could you tell us what North American seed price was if you excluded the free seed given for replant of flooded acres? And then if you look at the Latin American seed pricing of 14%, it was flat last quarter. Could you tell us maybe what it was on a year-to-date basis because there must have been some strong mix effects quarter-to-quarter in the seeds and Latin America? Jim Collins : Yeah, I'll start. Again, Tim, he will close to this day to day. But, yes, we did have a slightly elevated level of replants in there year-over-year probably more replant in beans than we had in corn. But when you exclude the effects of replant, the pricing was about flat year-over-year. So and then on Latin America, Tim, I\u2019ll let you to comment. Tim Glenn : Yes, just to, kind of, close the door on the replants, I mean, this is a customary program that we would have in place to ensure that our customers are getting the most value out of our products. We ensure that they get a good stand. And I'd say it's \u2013 while there's different variations in the industry, fairly standard across the board and it can vary quite a lot between year-over-year. And what we saw this year more or less on corn was about a 10% increase versus the five year average. And then on soybeans, as Jim said, we were \u2013 we saw more replant. It was more or like 30% above what that five year average was. And if you look back at the season and obviously not surprising considering the weather counts as we had. And I would say in Latin America, a couple things that are driving our ability to price. One would be, we've got very strong performance and we've been able to effectively establish the Brevant brand and positioned the Pioneer brand appropriately, so very good overall product performance. And then we're getting a strong benefit from the continued increase in utilization of new technologies like PowerCore Ultra and our Leptra hybrid. So it's a combination of mix. It's a combination of strong performance. And I think again, very good momentum that we're hearing in the marketplace in both Brazil and Argentina. So it's really a Latin American story, not strictly a Brazil story. John Roberts : Thanks, Tim. Operator : Our next question will come from Jonas Oxgaard was Bernstein. Please go ahead. Jonas Oxgaard : Good morning. Jim Collins : Good morning, Jonas. Greg Friedman : Good morning. Jonas Oxgaard : You talked in the beginning of the call a bit about the outcomes of the harvest and all the uncertainty. Can you help us to think through what the impact is in these different scenarios? If we take two scenarios of one where corn price stays loosely where it is today and harvest is okay versus one where the harvest is much weaker corn price goes to four bucks. How does that impact next year's results for you? Jim Collins : Thanks. Thanks Jonas. Clearly, as Tim mentioned earlier, we watched that soybean to corn price ratio really closely because over the years that we've been watching this, there is an indifference point where the economics and the value of those two crops sort of balance. And so, as we see pricing differences, we see that ratio swing and we watch demand swing with that for corn. So, right now, the scenario that's out there to best data that we really have, the USDA estimates around yield, but also USDA estimates around intended planting for 2020. I would say that we will see a little bit more corn and we'll see maybe the balance one third, two thirds more of those acres that Tim mentioned coming back in to soybeans. So if you saw a big swing in price, more towards corn. You'd see growers respond to that. The way our portfolio sits today on a net margin basis, as we've said many times before, our profitability would favor stronger corn acres than soybean acres, but we're really starting to change that equation. You start to think about the penetration that we will have with Enlist going forward as we've added other products to our portfolio, the A series soybeans and the relative performance that we're having on that portfolio and our ability to price for the value that we deliver, it's starting to moderate that margin different slightly. So we're just going to put ourselves in a position to respond to the market with however it get turns out and we'll be ready depending on those two scenarios. Jonas Oxgaard : Okay, that\u2019s fair. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. You had a few of your crop chemical peers post results in the last couple of days. And one area that seems to reflect a differential result is Latin America, where you had peers that posted some pretty strong volumes in contrast to yours. And I just wanted to get your view on that. You did note that there was some volume pull into the second quarter and a little bit of a push into the fourth quarter. Is this a differential impact on Corteva because of your product mix or your crop focus? Or is there anything else going on here like capacity constraints in Spinosyns? Or is there any area where you might be losing some market share? Jim Collins : Yes, Steve. So let's just start with the Latin America message. You really can't just look here at third quarter and really compare what's going on. If I step back from that, our Latin America business, overall for the year organically is up 8%. So you said it accurately. There was a large portion of our crop protection business because of the products we sell and the timing of the market was really accelerated into the second quarter and we reported out on that very, very specifically. And then on top of that, we've got some of the leading fungicides for soybeans in Brazil and you're all reading about what's happening with the planting in Brazil. Due to lack of rains, we've had a slightly delayed planting. And so the setup for our products has shifted a little bit here into fourth quarter. And we've got good indications that that flow of products is happening, we've got October essentially behind us here and we can see good volume growth. So, when you step back then and look at insecticides overall, it again really is not a story year-to-date. Our insecticide business in Latin America is up as much as 30% and globally our insect portfolio is up 9% and we expect the market maybe is more like mid 5% range. So we're outpacing the market. Maybe I'll ask Rajan to talk a little bit about capacity and capacity constraints. We've done a lot in that. You saw some announcements we made today. So Rajan, do you want to talk a little bit about that? Rajan Gajaria : Yes, thanks a ton Jim and hi Steve. Related to the capacity like from a Spinosyn standpoint, like Jim said, a 9% growth year-over-year of three quarters on the insecticide business, it's continuing to meet our expectations. The good news is that as the market continues to grow and we continue to see more demand for our products, we are installing more capacity. And that was the capital project that we just announced earlier this week said that we are building more capacity in. So very confident about where the insecticide portfolio is despite some of the supply challenges across the globe on insecticides. We have actually continued to grow. The Brazilian market is one indication, but as Jim said, globally insecticide portfolio continues to grow and we continue to have high expectations of this portfolio for 2020 and beyond. Jim Collins : And Steve, I'll just maybe want to \u2013 I just clarify additional comment. The announcement that we made today is not the first expansion that we've had in that portfolio, almost the day of merge, the opportunity in our insecticides space was obvious to us as a leadership team. And so, this is another now succession or installment of capacity to carry us out now well into the 2020s, but thanks to some of those early steps. If we looked since merge, we've grown our Spinosyns portfolio by 27% through the end year of 2019. And if I just kind of look at the plans that we're talking about and have in place going into 2020, I mean, we're going to be up 50% from where we were at merge with that complex of Spinosad and Spinetoram. So, I could be prouder of the team and how we're executing. And clearly market demand is there for this chemistry that that really occupies a very nice space in the market. So we're going to keep driving it hard as we go forward. Operator : And our last question will come from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead. Don Carson : Yes, thank you. Jim, a question on your safrinha outlook. Typically, when soybean planting is late, sometimes seed grower shipped to lower quality seed because of the abbreviated safrinha season. So what's implicit in your $1.9 billion EBITDA guidance this year or what a short fall in safrinha be more of a 2020 item? And then just a housekeeping item, what's your total receivables exposure in South America? Jim Collins : Maybe Tim do you want to talk about some safrinha and Greg can give us receivables update. Tim Glenn : Hey, morning Don. A question on safrinha obviously, we look at that very closely as well in terms of the progress. That's one of the key indicators on how that safrinha season is going to go. And we got to look at two elements there. One is the area what gets planted and the second element is around technology that they're going to employee. So, we're monitoring that closely. And I'd say it's probably too early to call whether there is a major technology shift. I think at the area level, I don't think we're at risk in terms of seeing a reduced area for maybe what the original intentions were. So I feel pretty good about that. And in terms of the technology employed that probably will end up being more of a 2020 type issue because of the fact that that first planted safrinha seed will still be with our strongest hybrids of the highest technology. So, what we would typically move into customers hands in December of 2020 \u2013 December 2019 will be planted in a window where they should be able to get really good performance and it's not necessarily a late planted risky crops. So, we'll continue to monitor that. Again, we get reports on the ground most every day on what that progress and what the expectations are. And we'll be prepared to deal with that if we do see a technology shift. Greg Friedman : Great. And then related to receivables, I would characterize our current receivables position in Latin America today is on track with our expectations as we \u2013 as we're monitoring and focusing on collections right now. Our past dues year-over-year are better and in fact we are seeing our bad debt write-offs this year to be better than our expectations. So I would characterize that \u2013 just to be cautiously optimistic here I would characterize that absolutely as on track even though we are trending a little bit better right now. Jim Collins : So, thank you all for your questions. I did want to close with an update on the Chemours litigation. As you know, Corteva and DuPont jointly filed a motion to dismiss. We expect the matter to be fully briefed by November 8 subject to oral arguments that are really yet to be scheduled. A decision on our request for that dismissal should follow shortly thereafter. And as we've said before, we believe that claims made by Chemours are without merit and that Corteva will vigorously defend against the claims in the complaint, uphold our rights that were specified under the separation agreement. So with that, I want to thank you all for joining our call today. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Collins : Thank you Megan and thank you and welcome to the participants joining the call. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter and full year results for 2019. Our key operational performance indicators for the full year are captured on chart four. Net sales on a reported basis decreased 3% versus the prior year, primarily due to currency. On an organic basis, net sales were flat as weather-related declines in North America were offset by above market organic growth in other regions. Outside of North America, reported net sales were up 1% and organic sales were up 7%, demonstrating the strength of our pipeline, brands and multi-channel distribution strategy. Operating EBITDA declined 4% compared to prior year, largely driven by currency and weather-related price and volume declines in North America. Continued realization of cost synergies, disciplined spending actions, increased sales from new products and gains on divestitures were a benefit. Operating EBITDA margin declined 10 basis points for the full year for the company. In crop protection, new product sales and gains on divestitures resulted in margin expansion. In seed, weather-related price and volume declines in North America drove margin decline. Selling, general and administrative and R&D costs declined 4% for the full year due to cost synergy realizations and the benefit from disciplined spending actions. In total, we realized approximately $350 million in cost synergies, accelerating $50 million of savings into 2019 relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year. Overall, these indicators show that we capitalized on the strength of our product pipeline and realized above market organic growth outside of North America. We also delivered on our cost synergy commitments and intensified our productivity actions to support sustainable operating EBITDA expansion. Finally, we acted on our portfolio to divest products that are not aligned with our strategy moving forward. Turning to slide five. We have previously talked about ROIC as key performance indicator to assess our effectiveness in using capital to generate earnings. We are targeting a sustained mid to high teens percent performance on this metric. Using a four quarter average, we delivered a return of 19.8% for 2019. Now this result demonstrates our focus on driving effective risk management, reducing inventory carryover and maintain diligence on accounts receivable and collections. Going forward, our ERP implementation will be critical to maintaining performance at this level. Our harmonized ERP system will allow our teams to have real-time transparency and actionable data to drive continued working capital productivity. Side six highlights our progress on our five priorities for shareholder value creation. These priorities guide our strategic actions and underscore the quality of the result we are committed to achieve. Well, starting first on culture. Given the historic market backdrop, it is sometimes easy to forget that we launched a new pure-play agriculture company in June with the new Corteva brand, new values and a new purpose. In our first quarter as a public company, we put in place a cultural transformation called execute to win. This is an example of how we intend to operate differently as Corteva. In 2020, we are targeting $30 million in operating EBITDA benefit as we get started on delivering our target of $500 million in incremental operating EBITDA over the next five years. Moving to capital allocation. We look to invest productively in innovation and growth. An example is the project announced last quarter to add additional manufacturing capacity for key Spinosyns insecticide products. While continuing to invest in innovation and growth, we are committed to delivering value to shareholders in the form of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. In total, our actions returned approximately $220 million to shareholders in 2019. On our priority related to developing innovative solutions, we received regulatory approvals in 2019 for several proprietary traits. In February, we received the final import approvals necessary to launch Enlist E3 soybean products and Qrome corn products. in late December, China approved our Conkesta insect control trait in soybeans. Conkesta soybean import approval had been in progress in China since 2014. The receipt of China approval for Conkesta is a necessary step for commercialization of Conkesta E3 product in Latin America. This is another important milestone towards trait independence. Today, we announced our intention to accelerate product development and production of Enlist E3 soybean products along with Enlist One and Enlist Duo herbicides, ahead of the 2021 selling season. This decision reflects our focus on rapidly ramping up differentiated technology solutions that we expect will enable greater choice and value for growers over time. On our priority around best-in-class cost structure, we delivered $50 million in cost synergies in the quarter and approximately $350 million for the full year. Overall, we have realized cumulative cost savings through the end of 2019 of $800 million, out of the $1.2 billion commitment expected through 2021. In 2019, we also authorized and launched an ERP harmonization project that is focused on eliminating approximately $200 million in costs inherited with the spin. Finally, weather-related impacts and currency obscured several positive signs of operational momentum in 2019. Of note, our strong growth in insecticides and our positive organic net sales performance outside of North America. We took several actions in seed, like launching our global retail brand Brevant and restructuring our brands in North America to create a more powerful regional anchor brands that we expect to deliver above market growth in the future and continued momentum on share gains in local markets. And now, I will turn the call over to Tim to provide some details on our commercial performance. Tim Glenn : Thanks Jim. Starting on slide seven, I will provide details on how our teams executed around the globed in terms of topline performance. 2019 was a very complex and dynamic ag market, but through all of that, I am proud of how our teams positioned themselves to win in the market and deliver above market growth. In North America, organic net sales were down 6%. Due to the weather-related delays, approximately 11 million fewer acres of corn and soybeans were planted in the U.S. year-over-year. As a result, seed units were down significantly and reduced applications had a negative impact on crop protection. Pricing was challenged due to higher replants in both soybeans and corn, coupled with heightened competitiveness in the marketplace around soybean pricing. Despite a very challenging environment, our teams achieved share gains in both Pioneer corn and soybeans for the year. Additionally, excluding replant, we were able to hold price flat in Pioneer corn. In terms of crop protection inventories, we see elevated levels in the U.S. market, primary in corn and soybean herbicides. We also saw strong early demand in the fourth quarter for Enlist chemistry due to 2020 ramp-up. In Latin America, our teams delivered 8% organic growth led by strong demand for new product. We successfully implemented the brand positioning for Brevant and launched new technology like Powercore Ultra which resulted in share gain in summer corn in Brazil. We did see a more normal start to the second corn crop for safrinha season which limited volumes in the fourth quarter but we expect to see those sales in first quarter 2020. In crop protection, new products like Isoclast insecticides contributed to growth as we obtained registration for the product in Brazil and the overall insecticide market continues to expand. In Asia Pacific, we delivered 3% organic growth on improved pricing and volumes under challenging and dynamic market conditions. Insecticides continue to drive growth, particularly in our Spinosyns product offering, given strong local demand. Drought conditions limited our opportunity to drive fungicide sales particularly in South Asia and Australia. In seed, the launch of our Brevant brand in the India corn market and an integrated portfolio approach around rice continues to be a strategy that enables us to win in the market. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, gains in volume and price led to organic growth of 7% versus a market growth of around 1%. In Europe, strong demand for new products like Arylex herbicide and Zorvec fungicide continued to drive topline growth despite regulatory challenges for other products including chlorpyrifos. We believe that our seed and crop protection business gained share across Europe this year, primarily due to strong demand for new products. In particular, route-to-market changes in Russia and Ukraine drove market share growth in both corn and sunflower seed. Now before I turn the call over to Rajan, I want to quickly make a point on slide eight that I believe sets us apart in the marketplace and is at the center of how we operate each and every day and that starts with demand creation. Our ability to create demand or market pull for Corteva products and services through direct contact with farmers. At our core is the focus on servicing farmer customers and our ability to be on the ground working closely with them to find technology and agronomic solutions that meet their needs and address their challenges. We use multiple paths to reach farmers including strong collaboration with our channel partners and an increasing use of digital technology to support face-to-face contacts in the field. There are several illustrations on this chart including education of customers on solutions to manage a new insect pest that was threatening their crop and livelihood, the introduction of a new [indiscernible] production system that will deliver economic, [indiscernible] and environmental benefits and the introduction of a new solution that combines seed and crop protection technology to address one of the most pressing needs of soybean farmers. This relentless focus on the customer is something we believe we do better than anyone else in the industry as we engage with more than 10 million farmers worldwide. As a result, we gained share in Asia for insecticides, we sold more than six million units of Brevant branded corn after just launching a few years ago and have overcome portfolio changes in our Brazil corn business as a result of the merger through share gains, just to name a few. I will now turn it over to Rajan to review segment performance. Rajan Gajaria : Thank you Tim. Turning to slide nine, highlighting the performance for full year in both our crop protection and seed segment. In crop protection, net sales were $6.3 billion, down 3% from the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to 3% decline from currency. Organic net sales increased 1% from the prior year, partially due to volume improvement on new and differentiated product. The percent of sales from patented and differentiated products for 2019 was approximately 30%, up from approximately 25% in 2018. Crop protection operating EBITDA was approximately $1.1 billion, down 1%. Unfavorable currency, volume declines in North America and higher input costs, excluding synergies drove the decline in EBITDA. The segment delivered on cost synergies and realized a benefit from new products and gain on divestitures. For the full year, crop protection delivered approximately 30 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion. In seed, net sales were $7.6 billion, down 3% for the year. Currency was a headwind of 2%. Weather-related impacts in North America were partially offset by growth in other regions, particularly strong demand and pricing on Powercore Ultra corn products in Latin America, new route-to-market enhancements in Europe and market share gains in corn in South Asia. Seed operating EBITDA was approximately $1 billion, down 9% versus the prior year, reflecting the impact of the North America weather-related decline, market competitiveness in soybeans and unfavorable currency. Cost synergies, particularly in R&D and seed production, were a benefit to the segment. Turning now to slide 10 for a closer look at several products that contributed to the full year segment results and are helping to create a clear path for future above-market growth. Starting with insecticide, where the overall market grew 6%, Corteva net sales were $1.7 million, an increase of 10% from the prior year. Organic net sales were up 14%. This growth was led by our unique Spinosyns franchise. Outside of North America, Spinosyns contributed 40% of the organic net sales growth for crop protection despite supply constraints in several regions. As we expect strong market growth in insecticides to continue, we recently announced out intention to add additional capacity in support of our Spinosyns insecticide offering. The combined impact of our investment since merger close will essentially double our capacity at full utilization to address global market growth in insecticide. Looking next at corn. Net sales were $5.1 billion in 2019, down 1% from the prior year. With nearly 60% of global corn sales originating in North America, weather-related volume and price impacts in that region resulted in the decline. Though it was a challenging year, we are seeing green shoots sprouting. Qrome corn products received China import approval in February 2019 and were offered commercially across a broad range of geography. In November, we shared the result of our field trial. Pioneer brand corn products delivered nearly a seven bushel per acre average yield advantage, measured against all competitors and comparable technology segments. In 2020, Qrome products are expected to represent 20% of our online. With the demonstrated yield advantage, we expect Qrome products to deliver low single digit price improvements year-over-year. And today, we announced our decision to accelerate production of Enlist E3 soybeans, along with the Enlist One and Enlist Duo herbicide. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we finalized our breeding plans and large-scale product development timeline that enable the seed ramp-up. We believe Enlist E3 soybean launched in 2019 in the United States and Canada are the most advanced weed control trait technology for soybean. Following the positive on-farm performance of Enlist E3 soybeans in the fall of 2019, we received supportive feedback from growers, retailers and independent seed companies. So we have accelerated our ramp-up plans to deliver this important technology even faster than originally anticipated. We now estimate that Enlist E3 soybean penetration in 2020 will be 20% of total North America acres, up from the 10% previously indicated. These are just a few examples of tangible actions that underscore our target of growing 2% to 3% above the market over mid-term. With that, I turn the call over to Greg who will provide details on our financials. Greg Friedman : Thank you Rajan. Turning to slide 11 for a brief overview of our fourth quarter performance. Net sales, on a reported basis, improved 6% versus the prior year, primarily due to strong volumes in both North America and Latin America, partially offset by currency. Organic sales were up 9% with improvements in both segments. In seed, we delivered 13% organic growth led by both volume and price improvements, primarily in North America and Latin America. Specifically, we recorded higher sales in our multi-channel brands in the U.S. versus prior year due to improved supply chain performance. Continued penetration of new products in Latin America drove 8% pricing improvement for the quarter. In crop protection, organic sales improved 7% for the quarter on broad-based growth in most regions, which was led by North America with improved volumes from early demand for Enlist herbicide in advance of the 2020 season. In addition, continued ramp of new products, particularly insecticides, in Europe, Middle East and Africa and Latin America helped drive volume and price improvements. Operating EBITDA of $224 million improved by $174 million compared to prior year, largely driven by higher sales in both segments, continued realization of cost synergies and gains on divestitures. Margins benefited from improved mix from Powercore Ultra in Latin America and demand for new crop protection products like Isoclast insecticide and Enlist herbicide. Gains on divestitures aligned with our ongoing best owner portfolio strategy resulted in approximately $70 million of gains in the quarter. R&D expense was lower by more than $50 million in the quarter compared to prior year, due to cost synergies, timing as well as focused actions to control spending. Turning to slide 12 for a year-over-year comparison of operating EPS. Currency was a $0.19 headwind for the year, primarily from the Brazilian Real and the Euro. Volume and price amounted to a $0.04 decline year-over-year primarily due to weather-related impacts in North America and competitive pricing in soybeans. Costs were better by $0.08 on continued realization or merger-related synergies which were partially offset by higher input costs in seed. Our base tax rate for the year was 19.6%, representing a reduction of $0.06 compared to prior year. We generated $0.10 of benefit from foreign exchange gains related to our balance sheet hedging program. Lastly, other was a $0.02 benefit, primarily from gains on divestitures. Turning now to slide 13, I will provide our full year guidance for 2020. Considering our market backdrop, a few key areas that we continue to monitor include commodity price levels, near-term fluctuations in trade and expected farm level profitability. There continues to be uncertainties in each of these areas which impact customer planting decisions and input purchases. Our full year guidance incorporates caution relative to these uncertainties. Touching first on net sales. We expect reported net sales to be approximately $14.5 billion, up about 4% to 5% over prior year. This primarily reflects normalized conditions in the North American market coupled with continued ramp of new products globally in both our crop protection and seed segments. We expect global ag markets will grow at about 2.5% to 3% next year as U.S. corn and soybean area and production are expected to be higher in 2020 on a return to normal planting season weather. Global demand for agricultural products continues to be strong helping reduce ending stocks in both corn and soybeans. Market opinions differ on the degree of increase for both corn and soybean area and this will continue to materialize into the first half as growers make their ultimate planting decisions. At this point, we expect currency to be relatively flat year-over-year. However, we are closely monitoring currency movements in Latin America, particularly the Real as well as employing hedging strategies to help manage volatility. On operating EBITDA, we expect to deliver about 12% improvement year-over-year. With our expected topline growth and continued focus on delivering cost savings commitment, we expect to improve margins by approximately 100 basis points for the total company. Turning to operating EPS. We expect to deliver between $1.45 and $1.55 per share, which would represent a 5% improvement using the midpoint over 2019. We have provided detailed modeling guidance in the appendix of our presentation. Now as it relates to key assumptions incorporated into our guidance, slide 15 provides more detail. Starting with above-market growth, 2020 expectations are led by the recovery to normalized conditions and planted area in the North American market. We are assuming roughly 11 million acres returned with about two-thirds going to soybeans. We will update our assumptions when market data is available as part of the March prospective planting estimates published by the USDA. On pricing, we are confident we will realize gains in the low single digits for corn globally. This is a function of the technology we offer customers and the value it creates in the market. In North America, we expect pricing lift in corn due to improved mix, primarily from the launch of Qrome and proprietary seed treatment offering. In soybeans, 2020 will be a continuation of 2019 in terms of price competitiveness. We expect these trends to potentially amplify this upcoming year and believe soybean prices in North America will be an approximate $50 million headwind on operating EBITDA year-over-year. In crop protection, new products will continue to ramp globally as registrations expand. In total, we expect growth from new product sales in 2020 to be approximately $250 million. Turning to costs. We remain committed and fully expect to deliver on the incremental $200 million in merger-related synergies. In terms of productivity, we expect to capture approximately $30 million in operating EBITDA improvement in 2020 as we execute against projects to deliver savings. As part of this, we are considering a restructuring plan that is subject to Board approval. This program represents the necessary actions we need to take as an organization to build on a targeted cost structure that is best-in-class. We look forward to sharing more details as these plans further develop and we take action. We expect corporate costs to remain on target at less than 1% of sales. Cost of goods is estimated to have incremental cost of approximately $150 million, which includes higher unit cost in seed from lower yield and increased royalty costs, primarily due to the accelerated ramp of Enlist E3 soybeans. To close, we expect 2020 to be a year of strong sales and earnings improvement, in line with our mid-term targets and are confident we have appropriately dialed in risks based on uncertainties as we see them today and are fully committed to deliver on the guidance we are providing. In addition, the organization is focused on maximizing opportunities as market conditions firm and we look to provide updates on those as the year progresses and results materialize. I will now turn the call back to Jim. Jim Collins : Thanks Greg. Before we go to Q&A, I wanted to offer a few final comments on a remarkable year. Without a doubt, we will remember 2019 as a historic year for our industry and our company. As we look forward, I am encouraged by our accomplishments as we navigated unprecedented market conditions to deliver a solid finish to the year. We have also laid the groundwork to deliver on our commitments going forward. Now I have said that Corteva is a different kind of agriculture company and part of that difference is how we support our customers and partner with society. The agriculture industry has been facing one of the most challenging periods in history due to weather, trade and regulatory burdens, which have limited access to new innovations and safe and reliable seed and crop protection products. We are encouraged to see a resolution to the trade dispute with China and the passage of the USMCA. We worked closely with the U.S. government to advocate for more transparent and predictable regulatory approvals as part of the trade resolution with China, which helped to secure important approvals for Enlist E3, Qrome and Conkesta. I testified last July in front of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee in support of the USMCA as a vehicle to further expand and modernize North America trade and increase grower and consumer access to innovation. Both trade deals will be positive over the long term for growers and agricultural demand. We feel privileged to use our influence as a public company to drive positive societal impacts. It is our purpose to enrich the lives of those who produce and those who consume, ensuring progress for generations to come. With that, I will turn the call back to Megan. Megan Britt : Thank you Jim. Let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our cautions on forward-looking statements, non-GAAP measures and pro forma financials apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instruction. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Joel Jackson : Good morning, everyone. Jim Collins : Good morning Joel. Joel Jackson : Hi. You talked in the past about trying to hit a free cash flow conversion target in 2020 of 50% to maybe a little better than 50%. There wasn't anything on the release or the presentation about that or the remarks today. Maybe give an idea about the puts and takes on free cash flow conversion? Where you might be in 2020? Where you might be in 2021? Thanks. Jim Collins : Yes. Great. Joel, obviously all of that is still coming together and as we close our first full year, we are getting new clarity around those numbers. Greg, do you want to share some more specifics? Greg Friedman : Yes. Thanks Jim. As Jim mentioned, 2019 cash flow was a complex year with the first half incorporating cash flow elements from our heritage companies and the second half really represented Corteva's results. And that validated our ability to manage effectively our seasonal working capital movements. So we remain committed to our target of converting more than 50% of our operating EBITDA into free cash flow while continuing to grow the topline and improving our margins. Specifically for 2020, we are focused on driving working capital productivity. That will translate into cash flow improvement in a year where our business is growing. And also, you will notice in our guide, our capital expenses are lower by roughly $100 million than the prior year at the midpoint which is consistent with our commitment to manage capital. In 2020, as I mentioned, it will be the first year that we will have standalone cash flows without discontinued operation and spin related uses of cash. So we will continue to provide updates on our progress on free cash flow conversion for 2020 throughout the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you, Jim. Just on the soybean price headwind, I think before you were looking at perhaps soybean price mix to be flat North America with price down and mix up, maybe 2% each. Now I think we are looking at pricing in soybean to be down maybe 5% or more. One, is that correct? And two, what caused the change or the more severe pricing headwind in North America? Jim Collins : Great. David, thanks for the question. You are right. We do expect our soybean pricing, primarily in North America, to be down low single digits. And it is a direct response to the market competitiveness that's going on and the aggressiveness that is out there in the market. It is early and early in the invoicing process for soybeans. And we are taking a very selective approach to how we respond to that. And Tim, you are a lot closer to this on a day-to-day basis. Anything else you would highlight? Tim Glenn : Yes. Jim, I would highlight that very strong performance in our soybean product line, especially Roundup Ready 2 Xtend portfolio. And we did come out with the expectation of being flat. The year started where our largest competitor in the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend segment came out of the door by taking their prices down low single digits. So that was kind of the environment we entered the season in. And I think our value proposition and our performance advantage in services is holding up well. But it's important to know that we need to take this $50 million and use it on a very selective basis to shore up our position. So this is not a broad price adjustment. It really is a very specific competitive response and we can manage this on a customer-by-customer basis. So just to give you some idea, that $50 million really represents somewhere less than one-half of 1% price adjustment across that business. So it is very specific, very targeted and I think it's really important that we use that to shore up our position in what is a very highly competitive marketplace. Jim Collins : David, I would just add. As I step back and we think about overall pricing, we always put that in the context of three areas. The market backdrop is one of them. And I think we have dealt with that pretty well globally, understanding what our customers are facing. We always put that in the context of our product performance. And I think we have got about the best lineup in the marketplace from a performance perspective. So we are going to continue to price for the value that we deliver. And the third element that Tim mentioned is the competitive response out there. So it is really is, we are focused on one reason and really one product right now and everywhere else in the world, I would say across the board, I feel really good about where we are. Operator : Thank you. Next, we will hear from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Good morning. Jim, if I can just ask you on the Enlist rollout that you expect, when do you think you will have Enlist and Pioneer germplasm? And then as do this, can you help us understand sort of the SKU complexity and maybe inventory management decisions you are going to have to make and this is going to impact working capital at all? Jim Collins : Yes. Great. Vincent, thanks for the question. From the beginning of the creation of Corteva, we have talked about creating more choices in the marketplace. And so we are very excited about the announcement that we put out today about our plans to accelerate the ramp-up of Enlist. I think about that ramp-up over the next five years would be kind of the timeframe of where we would expect to get to peak penetration. And it's about a commitment that we are making to the technology and towards that longer term proprietary trait and brand strategy that we have been talking to you about. So a real big proof point here today that we are on that path. The other thing to remember is, we talk about Enlist. It is a system. It includes branded seed sales. So you are right. There is a Pioneer brand element to this. But also our other multi-brands and maybe I have Rajan share a little more about that around how we are going to manage to through the inventory cycle that you were asking about. Remember, this also gives us an out-licensing opportunity. So there is income and revenue from out-licensing. And it's part of that royalty improvement path that we have talked about. So with that, Rajan, we have got a project team up and running. We have got a detailed plan over the next three to five years to really manage all of those moving parts. You want to share a little more of detail there? Rajan Gajaria : Absolutely. Thanks again for the question. Just let's start talking about inventory. I think inventory management is a key area of focus from a seed productivity standpoint and we have got a lot of activity initiated as we transition platform. We start really with no carryover from Enlist into our germplasm. So we have got a very robust plan. So you should not expect increase in inventory. We will continue to work with getting the best Pioneer germplasm with Enlist trait in this. We are already launching Enlist in the pioneer brand and with our multi-channel brands this year. So we have got a very robust inventory management plan which will ensure that the transition doesn't result in any increase in inventory. So thank you for the question. Operator : We will go next to Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Jonas Oxgaard : Hi. Good morning. I was hoping to talk a little bit about the value of Conkesta. What kind of premium we are hoping, market share and ramp? And also, what happens to Conkesta if buyer looses the patent dispute on Intacta they are fighting right now? Jim Collins : Great. Thanks Jonas. You are right. We are very excited to have recently received the China approval that I mentioned. We will have that opportunity to stack Conkesta with E3 for something, for a product in the Brazil market that we believe will be differentiated and it's again one more step towards that trait independence that we have talked about. We need still a little bit of time for that product to kind of be ready for the full launch in Brazil. One of the things we are waiting on is EU approval for the stack. We have submitted and we anticipate that sometime in 2021 or so we will get those approvals. We also have to go through the same process that we went through on Enlist around the breeding plan, accelerate the introgression of that trait into our background germplasm and that process kind of starts now. So earliest commercialization could be the latter part of 2021 and it gives us a real opportunity to drive new market share. Our share, as you know, in soybeans in Brazil is kind of in the low single digit range here today. So Rajan, anything else you would add? Rajan Gajaria : Yes. I think just to add on the question, Jonas, about Intacta, we are watching that closely. But really, it comes back to a value proposition for the grower. We feel very confident about the value proposition that Conkesta will bring to the marketplace. The Brazilian farmers, historically, have been always willing to pay for the right technology which we bring there. And from a Conkesta perspective, we are very confident that we should be able to extract value for the technology that we are bringing there for them. So looking forward to a rapid ramp-up of Conkesta. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. On page four in your press release, in your crop protection area, you have good growth in your major subsegments but in your other category I think you go from $155 million in revenues to $70 million and for the year from $382 million to $253 million. What's behind that decrease? And because the decrease is so large, has it come to an end so that whatever is going on in that category will change for the better in 2020 as a base case? Jim Collins : Thanks, Jeff, for the question. You are right. That category covers a number of our other products in the marketplace. And as part of our portfolio work and we talk about our best-owner mindset, you see that we begin to rationalize pieces of those portfolios and some of those products would have been in there with revenue but very, very low margins or contributions to earnings. Rajan, anything else you would share about that category? Rajan Gajaria : No. I think, Jim, just bidding on what you said, I think on the other category, there are products, sometimes we have third-party products, et cetera that did not necessarily fir there. So we continued to reduce our sales in some of those products, which have no impact on us. There is also some categories which is like a catch-all where you have a miscellaneous bucket as we are working through our system to see what that is. So as that category reduces, I think the key message, Jeff, back to you is that we continue to expect a rapid ramp-up of our products as they move forward. There is a 30 basis point margin expansion in crop protection and that is all a reflection of how we are managing our portfolio actively. So feel very good about the commitment we have made of 2% to 3% above-market growth, which is going to be led by rapid ramp-up of lot of new technologies that cuts across all the segments. So no concerns there. Operator : Our next question will come from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Thank you. Is Asia primarily a Northern or Southern hemisphere market for you? I should know that. But I don't. I don't know whether this quarter it was down meaningfully is representative or is it seasonally low? And what's going on in there to cause that decline, especially in the crop protection chemical area? Jim Collins : Yes. John, thanks for the question. It primarily is the second half market for us on a calendar year basis, which we do kind of group it with the Southern hemisphere type performance. So I don't know, Tim, you want to share more specifics about what happens here? Tim Glenn : Yes. I think Asia, we have had several years of very strong growth and we actually have business that transpires over the course of the year. So it's hard to call it first or second, it really is a seasonal business and you have multiple seasons in different markets. So we actually do play in all parts. And on the year, we did see overall growth in the region and growth in both seed and crop protection and continued strength in particular in the insecticide segment. So I think what hit us as we came through the year and maybe why we took a little bit off the top was, when you talk about extended impact of the drought in Australia that is significant. And we also had periodic droughts over the course of the seasons, especially in the Albion countries. So think Indonesia especially and at one point, we did have a typhoon in the Philippines and all those things do impact the seasonal business that we have. So it's not quite as I guess is tied to the calendar as we would have in other markets. So it does play a little bit Northern hemisphere, a little bit Southern hemisphere but throughout the year. So again I think the highlight is, we grew nicely in both seed and crop protection, 3% overall in crop protection for the year and again double-digit growth in our insecticide portfolio, which again is capped by our ability to supply those markets. So we are very satisfied and we believe we did outperform the market again and we continue to have strong expectations for our business in Asia. Jim Collins : Yes. A number of our new products that we are launching have real utility as well as you have heard us talk about the insecticide expansions that we are making to continue to supply the Spinosyns product supply constraints that will really benefit Asia Pacific as we go forward as well. Operator : Our next question will come from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Good morning. Jim Collins : Good morning P.J. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi. Can you hear me? Jim Collins : Yes. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Thank you. So Jim, you have a lot of levers to pull in 2020. You have new product like Enlist E3 that would be on 20% of acres, you have Conkesta, Qrome, you have new products in crop protection, you have cost cutting, you are addressing new markets. So when you look at all these levers, what are the most important levers for you in 2020 that could create potential upside? And then what are the big risks for you in 2020? Thank you. Jim Collins : Great. P.J., thanks for the question. When I think about the key other drivers of additional upsides to the plan that we have laid out, I think one of the areas would be pricing. We are basically priced through the first half with offerings that we have out there in the market. So there will be small opportunities here and there to make adjustments. But that second half pricing opportunity is ahead of us. And as markets unfold, we will certainly have a very, very close eye on that. I think the second upside area revolves around route-to-market changes that we have been making. In the U.S., the multi-channel and multi-brand opportunities that you have there. And then in places like Eastern Europe where we launched a more direct approach and continuing to penetrate in Latin America, that's about driving share and margin going forward. And then finally, I think about the cost category. We are clearly laser focused on continuing to drive productivity. We are seeing that show up. You see a good evidence of that in the fourth quarter. We are carrying great momentum going into the year. So we have a base plan. But with our execute to win initiative, we got 20,000 employees now all around the world thinking like owners and bringing up ideas every single day about how to continue to improve productivity. So this would be another area where we are going to keep driving. Operator : We will go next to Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning. Three questions around Enlist. So Tim talked about your big Roundup Ready 2 Xtend customer cutting price. Does Enlist have to match that in the market? Or can it move to more of a premium? Second, Greg talked about royalty cost increasing as your ramping the Enlist trait. I think that surprises most people because you own the Enlist trait. So I think most would have thought that was kind of a free on board. So can you talk about the mechanics of why the COGS increases as that goes up? And then your bump from 10% to 20% of Enlist this year, how much of that was driven by your own seed and how much of that was driven by third parties? Jim Collins : Great. Duffy, thanks for the question. And you are right. There are a lot of moving parts with Enlist. We are excited about the announcement and the ability now to talk about the accelerated pace that we promised you we will be back to share with you as we close out the year. Why don't I turn it to Tim and have you talk about the first and the third one, pricing and the improvement from 10% to 20%? Tim Glenn : Yes. Hi. Good morning Duffy. When I think about Enlist pricing today, I mean, you have got to think this is really our first year of commercial sales. And so there is tremendous amount of energy and I don't necessarily see Enlist E3 competing head-to-head with Xtend at this point in time. There is significant presence in the market from multiple brands selling the product as well as Corteva's brand. And I would say, what you are seeing is some companies are taking a very, an approach around penetration pricing, really trying to go out there and drive trial and utilization from farmers. And as you can see, it's had a tremendous impact. So again, I don't see necessarily going head-to-head with the Xtend technology in the market per se, more about farmers excited to have a choice, a new option in the marketplace and using those market dynamics where penetration pricing is really helping to create some strong momentum for adoption. When you think about the move from 10% to 20%, I think it's a combination of both. We are getting very strong uptake on E3, particularly on our multi-channel business. And obviously the many other companies who are in the marketplace today are seeing that same level of adoption. So I think it's broad and really reflects positive energy from farmers, from retail channel and other seed companies for having that new choice, that new option available. So it's great to see that farmer interest really translate into orders at this point. Jim Collins : And then the other part of your question, Duffy, is yes, there are some short-term financial implications of the decision that we made, especially in the royalty area. We fully have dialed those in. So the plan that we have, the guidance we have, Greg, you want to share a little more detail around that? Greg Friedman : Absolutely. Let me clarify a little bit. The royalty that's increasing is on the Xtend portfolio. So our 2020 royalty costs are expected to increase, as we mentioned, by $50 million. And this change, by the way, does not have a cash impact. This is related to a change for the rate at which we recognize per unit royalty expense for Roundup Ready 2 Xtend and this will require that we record per unit royalty expense associated with the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend at the current rate rather than the average royalty rate over the life of the established contract since inception. So there is no impact to cash, as I mentioned, associated with this change. I will also mention that there is a non-operating accelerated amortization expense associated with the prepaid royalty that we have recorded on our balance sheet. Operator : We will go next to Don Carson with Susquehanna. Don Carson : Yes. A question on the current EBITDA walk versus what you have talked about in the past. So as I see it, you are about $180 million lower on your EBITDA outlook. Is that all due to headwinds? I mean in the past you used talk about perhaps about $100 million of headwinds in 2020. Now as I add it up, you get about $250 million. And specifically, you used to talk about a $250 million benefit in 2020 from normalized North American market conditions. Is that still part of your assumption? And you also used to have a $100 million benefit from new product growth. Is that now higher given some of these accelerations you are making? Jim Collins : Hi Don. Thanks for the question. As we built this 2020 plan, clearly it's aligned with our mid-term guidance that we have been out talking about. So this plan is absolutely aligned with those of that mid-term. We put a plan together where we de-risk. We have got a lot of confidence in this plan and we have got an opportunity, as you have heard a minute ago, to drive for some upside going forward. So I am confident that we have appropriately considered the uncertainties as we see them today. And then, the plan is consistent with some of the items that we have previously shared before. And the two broad categories of those, a number of growth items, the North America recovery is in there, the synergies and productivity are in there and the new product portfolio driving forward. So all very consistent with what we have shared in the past. We had anticipate some headwinds. Many of these very consistent with what we have also mentioned around soybean prices, higher COGS, some investments that we are making to drive growth. So, I don't know, Greg, do you want to maybe share a little more detail around those categories? Greg Friedman : Yes, Don, thank you for the question and I will just walk you through the numbers very quickly here. So you mentioned the North America market returned $250 million due to normalized whether. We are positioned and ready to realize this effective rebound of the market year-over-year. New products that we are anticipating, $100 million of margin improvement as we bring new technology to market. We talked about synergies and productivity. We are prepared and executing on projects to deliver that $230 million that we talked about. We also mentioned headwinds of about $100 million. Those do exist and they are primarily related to lower yield than anticipated and increased commodity prices. That's all confirming information that we previously provided. So what's new? A couple of things here. We talked about our global corn price increasing. We have got $100 million of global corn price that rebounded here. This is proof of the value of the innovation that we are delivering to the market and our ability to price for that value. We did talk about a $50 million on potential reduction in soybean price. That's dialed in as well. We also mentioned $50 million cost for implementing our ERP system and then the royalty element that we just discussed of another $50 million. Additionally, we had some portfolio actions in the fourth quarter as we executed our best-owner strategy. Those elements are not recurring. So we are not going to see those come back. And then finally, as Jim mentioned, investments in R&D and selling to bring our products to market. Operator : Thank you. And our last question will come from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Hello. Can you hear me? Jim Collins : Yes. We hear you now, Adam. Adam Samuelson : Thank you. So all the grounds have been covered here this morning. I was hoping maybe just to recap the 100 basis points of anticipated margin improvement in 2020. Can you walk through the key components of the pluses and minuses there? And kind of where opportunities may exist, where risks exist, in your mind, around that anticipated margin improvement? Thank you. Jim Collins : Great. Thanks, Adam. Clearly, a lot of that margin improvement is consistent with the new product launches that we have been driving, bringing new technologies. So that would be one aspect. Second, you hear the strength of our corn portfolio globally and the pricing that we are really driving in that portfolio and that's having a nice lift coupled with the new products. Qrome was the example that Tim mentioned earlier. And then finally, we continue to drive productivity. We have got the productivity related to the merger, the synergies that continue to flow through in finishing those out of the next two years and then the new productivity we are guiding as a result of our execute to win work. So those are probably the three major drivers. Megan Britt : Okay. I think that's going to conclude actually the Q&A for the call today. We really appreciate everyone who joined the call. Thank you so much. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure was available and provided in our earnings release and on our website. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Collins : Thank you, Megan, and thank you and welcome to the participants that are joining this call. Before turning to our normal financial and strategic reporting for the quarter, I wanted to share some thoughts on our current situation. Every member of our global team has been tasked to overcome new challenges due to the global health crises caused by Covid-19. I am completely in awe of how agile and resilient our team has been through this crisis, and I\u2019m inspired by how we\u2019ve leveraged our collective strengths to support our customers and our communities. One of our defining values is to live safely. Our crisis response started with ensuring the safety and security of our global team. In January, we activated a comprehensive crisis management effort, and by Mid-March set new policies taking more than 50% of our organisation to a work from home model, cancelling travel and in person meetings, ensuring our essential site personnel and field teams were properly equipped, and taking active strides to support every employee. I\u2019m exceptionally proud of the resiliency of the organisation, and I\u2019m committed to keeping our team healthy, motivated and intact. From a business continuity standpoint, as a reflection of our critical role in the global food supply, our operations were deemed essential. We leveraged our historical investments and supply chain resiliency, and regional production assets, to ensure that we could provide reliable product supply for our customers by quickly pivoting to alternative supply sources when disruptions emerged. To ensure the health and safety of our customers, we have migrated many field sales and agronomic service activities, normally done in person, to virtual or remote means, and have quickly installed contactless procedures to facilitate our physical product deliveries. We\u2019re leaning harder on the digital sales enablement tools that we have in place, taking greater leverage on investments made in those capabilities in the past. Finally, we are proactively seeking opportunities to partner with society, to devise solutions to mitigate the impacts of these crisis and facilitate a global restart. We are taking actions locally in communities where we operate to provide support in ways that underpin food security. We are also ready to put our innovation assets to work, to become part of the solution to this crisis. Most recently we announced our partnership with the Mercy One Hospital system in Iowa to perform Covid-19 testing. We have some of the most advanced genetic sequencing capabilities in the world and are leveraging those assets to support our communities. We responded aggressively to this current situation. As a result of our combined actions, I am confident that our team, our operations and our communities, will emerge stronger from this crisis. So, moving to Slide 5, we show our key performance indicators for the quarter. Net sales on a reported basis increased 16% versus the prior year. Improvement was driven by early Seed demand in North America and Europe, favourable weather and strong operational execution. Currency, particularly in Brazil and Europe, was a 3% headwind; portfolio represents a 1% hit in the quarter. On an organic basis, net sales increased 20% with double-digit increases in both reporting segments and across all regions. In Seed, organic sales were up 27% on early demand from favourable weather, the anticipated North American acreage rebound and improved prices, demonstrating the strength of our pipeline, particularly our Qrome and PowerCore Ultra corn products. In Crop Protection, organic sales increased 10%, supported by continued growth in new products, notably Arylex herbicide and Isoclast insecticide. Operating EBITDA increased 53%, and operating EBITDA margin improved more than 450 basis points for the quarter. In Seed, price and volume gains in North America and Europe drove margin expenses. In Crop Protection, new product sales and merger cost energies and productivity improvements contributed to gains. SG&A as a percent of net sales decreased by approximately 260 basis points in the quarter, R&D costs declined 6%. These improvements reflect the benefit of cost energies, productivity and ongoing efforts to drive spending efficiencies. Overall, these indicators show building market momentum for our new products, supported by strong regional execution. It capitalised on favourable weather conditions and a resilient supply chain to overcome challenges related to Covid-19. We delivered on our cost synergy commitments and intensified our productivity and spending actions to create operating EBITDA expansion in the quarter. Now, we made substantial progress delivering on our strategy, I want to underscore that our performance during this period demonstrates operational excellence, resiliency, and our capacity to adapt and deliver. Slide 6, outlines our five priorities for shareholder value creation, and we made progress on each of these. From a cultural standpoint, we have increased our focus on instilling an owner mindset to reduce spending and support cash preservation. Now, we are taking additional decisive and prudent actions, like delaying non-essential hiring and dramatically reducing spending to drive further operating leverage. Additionally, we are also focused on working capital management as a driver of cash preservation and have a cross functional cash action team in place. Diligence on costs and cash will reinforce our inherent operational defensiveness during this crisis. We are also working on taking additional organizational actions to insure we restart strong. Notably, we recently announced two key executive changes. Dr. Sam Eathington has been named as our Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer succeeding Neal Gutterson, following his announced retirement. Sam will lead our Global R&D Organization. And Alonzo has been named our Senior Vice President of External Affairs and Chief Sustainability Officer and is filling an open roll that will help us further our sustainability agenda. We are excited to have these talented leaders join the Corteva family. Moving to capital allocation, I'll highlight some actions that we have taken that positively impact our balance sheet. We have a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, which includes $6 billion in credit facilities, and approximately $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We are evaluating further cost-effective approaches to both strengthen our liquidity and to address our longer-term funding requirements associated with our primary us pension plan. In terms of returning cash to shareholders, we recently declared our second quarterly dividend for the year of $0.13 per share. We have also acted on share repurchases this quarter, with approximately $50 million repurchased. On our priority related to developing innovative solutions Corteva recently announced the first product registrations for Inatreq active in Europe, which adds to a series of early registrations. The favourable environmental profile of our newest technologies is helping to accelerate the speed of new crop protection product introductions to the market. In seed, increased adoption of new technology including Qrome and PowerCore Ultra enabled Corteva to gain momentum in North America and Latin America despite a competitive and challenging environment. On our priority around best in class cost structures, we delivered approximately $70 million in cost synergies in the quarter and remain on track to deliver $230 million in combined merger cost synergies and productivity savings by the end of the year. This was a large contributor to the over 450 basis point margin expansion in the quarter. Finally, on above market growth in the quarter Pioneer seed corn deliveries were up approximately 60% versus the same period last year. And corn price was up 4% globally. Both are strong indicators of our market momentum. I'll now hand the call over to Tim to provide some details on our commercial performance. Tim Glenn : Thanks, Jim. Starting on Slide seven, I'll provide details on how our teams around the world delivered for our customers this quarter. In North America volumes increased 26% compared to prior year. Improved weather relative to last year has enabled farmers to get to the field on time and in some cases a little early. The crop protection expectations for improved spring application drove increased volume led by Enlist herbicide. In seed the corn deliveries were up due to the recovery of planted area and even in a challenging environment our price for value strategy is working. Adoption of recently launched technologies including Qrome, corn seed and Lumialza seed treatment drove price increases during the quarter. Turning to Europe, Middle East and Africa, organic sales increase 11% versus the prior year. We delivered volume and pricing gains during the quarter as a strong start to the season growth demand. These increases were bolstered by an escalating situation with COVID-19 related concerns, which created a sense of urgency in some customers. The rapid and efficient responses from our team demonstrated once again solid execution in a very challenging time. This responsiveness also served to reinforce the advantages of the route the market changes we made last year. Together these helped us to get supply to farmers in a timely manner. Crop protection volume growth was driven by strong demand for new products such as Arylex and Rinskor herbicide. Latin America, our pipeline continues to deliver. Organic sales were up 30% in the region compared to the first quarter 2019 strong execution locally and recent Crop Protection and Seed technologies launches allowed us to achieve double-digit volumes and price increases. Even in the face of a significant currency headwind. The gains were driven by higher demand due primarily into a more normalized previous season, and were supported by improved mix with recent launches such as PowerCore Ultra. In Crop Protection, volume and price gains reflected ramp up of new technology, such as Isoclast insecticides. And finally, in Asia Pacific, our teams took the steps to largely mitigate impacts related to the Covid-19 crisis, resulting in organic sales increase of 10% versus prior year. Here, our teams navigated external complexities to get products and customers\u2019 hands. The most important takeaway is when our teams around the globe stepped up. They adapted, they acted quickly and they stayed agile. Turning to Slide eight. Let's take a look at the pace of the deliveries in the US through April. Corn deliveries to farmers were up significantly compared to this time last year. And this is directly aligned to what we're seeing with planting progress. The latest USDA progress report indicates we have 51% of corn planted compared to about 21% a year ago, and the five-year average of 39%. So, a strong start to the year with weather clearly a source of momentum versus what we were seeing a year ago. In March, the USDA issued prospective plantings, which indicated 97 million acres of corn. With the recent softening of commodity prices, particularly corn, there is a likelihood that we can see that corn number come down. It's still early to be certain on exact acreage. But from what we're seeing and hearing from our customers, we still expect to see a strong corn crop this year with at least 95 million acres being planted. We're also seeing solid signals of a rebound in soybeans with strong early seed deliveries. Our full launch of Enlist E3 soybean is on track. We're seeing solid demand from our growers as they prioritize choice in the marketplace and we continue to see Enlist soybeans to make up about 20% of the US soybean market for 2020. We're seeing high levels of soybean price competitiveness in the market. However, our teams are executing with strong internal pricing discipline, we originally estimated pricing would be down mid-single digits for US soybeans; however, at least early indication is that we're trending more favourably than that estimate. Currency is another area where we're focused as we look at the second quarter and the second half of 2020. The US dollar continues to strengthen. And with this, we're seeing continued evaluation of global currencies, notably the Brazilian reals. While we effectively offset currency headwinds in Latin America in the first quarter with pricing mix improvements, we're still evaluating additional strategy to address what we see as an ongoing currency headwind, but we'll be challenged to fully offset. While we feel good about the strong execution in the marketplace and the value our technology is continuing to deliver for farmers and for Corteva, we're keeping a very close eye on how things are evolving. We're putting the right plans in place to control what we can against this backdrop. We will continue to focus on strong demand creation, disciplined internal price management, and aggressive cost management. I'll now turn it over to Rajan to review segment performance. Rajan Gajaria : Thank you Tim. Turning to Slide nine, highlighting the performance of first quarter in both our Crop Protection and seed segments. In Crop Protection organic next sales increased 10% from the prior year, largely due to the growth of new and differentiated product. For the quarter new product sales were approximately $180 million about $70 million better than prior year. This was led by continued penetration of products, such as Arylex and Enlist herbicide, and Isoclast insecticide. For Spinosyns, we continue to see strong demand for this differentiated insecticide with volumes up 8% over prior year. Crop Protection operating EBITDA was $238 million up 8% improvement over the prior year and 50 basis point improvements in margins. We are tracing our synergies and productivity to the bottom line, which are partially offset by high input costs for catalyst materials, unfavourable currency and portfolio impacts. The first quarter is a heavy North America quarter with more than 30% of the total Crop Protection sales, which tends to be more concentrated in non-differentiated products, which are generally lower margins. Moving to seeds. Organic net sales were up 27% on strong volume improvements from early deliveries in North America as a result of favourable weather and anticipated recovery in planted area. Penetration of new products like Qrome in North America, and PowerCore Ultra in Latin America drove improved pricing compared to prior year. Seed operating EBITDA was $581 million, a $256 million improvement over prior year and margin improvement of greater than 700 basis points. The significant improvement is predominantly due to a US corn volume given their strong margin profile. U.S corn sales were 40% of total seed sales in the quarter. In addition, operating EBITDA benefited from the continued penetration of new products in the bottom and pricing gains we recognized on those products. Turning now to Slide 10 for a closer look at how the strategic design of our supply chain is proving to be a resilient coming into the global price. Stepping back a bit when we design the supply chain for Corteva, we made certain that flexibility and agility in supply, but at the foundation of our strategy. We were successful in implementing this structure which allowed Corteva to enter this crisis in a very strong position. In the quarter the industry observed supply outages in major geographies including China and India due to the Covid-19 restrictions, while many companies were impacted, we experienced minimal disruption given our supply chain design. Specifically, more than 80% of our total Crop Protection sales are supported by multi-sourced supply resiliency including approximately 65% with the U.S. - based source. This regulatory and source flexibility allows us to be proactive and not only how we think about sourcing products to meet customer demand, but also to optimize our supply and limit our risks for outages in the chain. In addition to this critical resiliency design element, we also have staged our formulation and packaging plants which produce our final product as close to the end use market as possible to be responsive to shifts in demand. This element along with the broad logistics supplier base and strategic inventory all along the supply chain provides additional agility in times of disruption. Another example of this resiliency is in the seed, where North America and Europe corn delivery increased by double digits in the quarter compared to prior year. With that, I turn the call over to Greg who will provide details on our financial position. Greg Friedman : Thank you Rajan. Turning now to Slide 11 I'll provide more perspective on the strength of Corteva\u2019s balance sheet and access to liquidity as well as share some cash preservation actions, we are taking during this crisis. Our liquidity position starts with an optimized capital structure and a strong balance sheet. As a financial policy, we aim to maintain A minus credit rating to support our customer financing program, which provides a competitive advantage in the marketplace and our seasonal working capital needs. We rely on a $5 billion commercial paper program to fund our working capital needs in a cost-effective way. Commercial paper is just one of our inter-year tools in funding working capital. We have access to $6 billion in revolving credit facilities to backstop this program along with a $1.3 billion repurchase facility that we renew annually. In total, we have approximately $8 billion in liquidity, including the $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents we have on our balance sheet. During the quarter we recognize periodic tightness in commercial paper markets as a result of the global crisis. Although our ability to access liquidity in the market was not shut, we did experience dislocation in rates and desired maturities that were not optimal for our needs. This led us to draw down $500 million on our credit facilities in the quarter. This illustrated how the tools in our liquidity structure are effective. I'm very competent in our liquidity position today despite the global crisis and the impact that it is creating on markets. However, given the uncertainties, we are taking prudent actions to preserve cash. It starts with working capital, including driving better productivities and how we use our balance sheet, to support our customers. This includes, tighter risk management of inventory production, SKU optimization and supply chain effectiveness to improve our inventory position. Additionally, we\u2019re working closely with customers to manage collections and drive down day sales outstanding and past dues and we\u2019re seeing good progress here. Next is cash earnings. A limiting spending to maximize our cash savings for the period. We are taking actions to evaluate R&D investment and align those investments with near term commitments in return, but are not sacrificing investments for above market accretive for us. In addition, we now expect that capital expenditures will be approximately $500 million for the year, at the low end our prior guidance. As the organization rationalizes capital spend with cash requirements and near-term commitments. These actions on cash conservation will continue to bolster our already strong balance sheet. Moving to a discussion of our outlook on slide 12. We are suspending our full year guidance due to the global Covid-19 crisis, which is creating significant uncertainty for global markets. As an organization, the environment is changing daily as this crisis unfolds, creating impacts on our business that we are unable to quantify today. There are several key areas that we are monitoring, that will ultimately impact our full year financial results. Given our strong execution in the quarter and heightened visibility on the progress of the Northern Hemisphere growing season, I\u2019ll provide some observation on the first half. As you know, most of our full year operating EBITDA has recognized in the first half. In terms of top line growth for the half, it is led by the market rebound in North America. And the expectation to see a combined $13 million additional acres between corn and soybeans with about 40% going to corn. We are monitoring what ultimately gets planted this season given recent softening in commodity price levels. We have had good visibility on pricing at this point for the half and are confident that we will deliver low single digit price improvements in corn globally. For soybeans, we have previously said we expected price to be down around $50 million for the full year. On the basis of recent soybean deliveries, we are trending favorably to that estimate for the first half and expect that U.S. soybean prices will likely be down low single digits. New product sales in crop protection are trending in line with prior expectations and we would expect first half sales from new products to be up approximately $120 million excluding currency. Overall organic growth in the first half is estimated to be approximately 6%. Looking at currency, we are seeing significant disruptions in global currency, specifically the Brazilian Real, when we issued guidance in January; we expected to use a combination of pricing and financial hedging to mitigate any currency headwinds, assuming a BRL to USD exchange rate of 4.25. In April, the market observed rates that were in some cases 30% above our assumption. Our teams are focused on executing mitigation efforts including pricing actions, spending reductions, and implementing financial hedging tools. However, given the extent of currency volatility so far this year, the full year implications are difficult to forecast. For the half, we expect an approximate $150 million of earnings headwinds from currency. Turning to costs. For the year, we remain committed on the execution and realization of our synergy and productivity commitments, and would expect to recognize approximately $115 million in the first half. For the most part, our costs of goods headwinds are playing out as expected with an estimated $150 million impact for the year from increased unit costs due to lower corn yield and higher soybean royalty costs. For the half, we expect to see about 75% of this headwind in our results. In addition to our merger related synergies and productivity actions, we are initiating targeted spending actions across the entire organization. This is to both preserve cash and create more resiliencies in our results. Through these actions, we expect to achieve annualized savings of approximately $100 million, partially offsetting higher commissions and ERP costs. For the first half, we would expect roughly a third of those savings to be realized. There are more details on first half indicators in the appendix for reference. We will provide updates on key second half indicators, most notably currency and 2021 corn acreage expectations throughout the year. I'll now turn the call back to Jim for some final comments. Jim Collins : Thanks, Greg. The strategy that we have in place is clearly delivering results. While we are in a crisis, we are not swayed from our purpose to enrich the lives of producers and consumers. In light of the current environment, this purpose has been endowed by a new sense of urgency and an unwavering resolve that is felt across the entire organization. We will do everything in our power to support our global teams, our customers and our communities to ensure a brighter future awaits on the other side of this challenging time. I'll turn the call back to Megan for our Q&A. Megan Britt : Thank you, Jim. Let's move on to your question. I would like to remind you that our cautions on forward looking statements, non-GAAP measures and pro forma financials apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instruction. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. DavidBegleiter: Good morning. Jim and Greg in terms of pull in the full year guidance and there is some uncertainty out in Q4 results in Brazil in terms of real. Have you - when you set pricing to potentially offset that those FX headwinds, and how much productivity can you get or could you get, so really, what can you offset from the real in that November, December timeframe with pricing productivity? Thank you. JimCollins: Right, David, thanks for the question. And you're right, the concerns that we have looking into the second half of the year really relate to our Brazil soybean business. And we've had some delays. The growers are right now kind of unwilling to commit to taking some of the early shipments that we have seen in the past. So we recognize our revenue when we shipped seeds, so over the next 90 days, this whole scenario will really play out as our sales teams are really working in that marketplace to set the prices. So, one of the great tools that we have is around pricing and once we price that seeds then working with our sales teams and growers to take delivery, as those deliveries get delayed, sometimes in October or November, that's really the window that we face the currency exposure because we've sent an invoice we've got a price to a grower, but we can't recognize that revenue till we deliver it much later in the year. So, we're evaluating other tools that we would have available different hedging tools and other tools. And maybe I'll ask Greg to say a few words about how we're approaching that part of the answer. GregFriedman: Yes. Thanks, David, and Thanks, Jim. There are a couple other things I'm going to add here. We have - we do have some natural hedges with respect to the local seed production that we do in each of our regions, as well as our formulation and packaging activities that we have within the region, so that was a bit of a natural hedge and then once we are able to obtain the commitments over the next 90 days from our customers to take product in the fourth quarter, that's when we'll look at and evaluating mitigation tools and activities as Jim mentioned. Operator : And next we move to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. VincentAndrews: Thanks and good morning, everyone. I'm kind of looking at Slides 14 and 15 here in Latin America, and I'm just trying to understand the difference between crop protection and seed in terms of 6% price versus negative 13% currency in crop protection and 16% price and negative 9% currency in seed so what's the mix effect there, why are those numbers - why are the currency numbers so different first of all. And then why are we able to achieve so many prices in seed versus crop protection. JimCollins: Yes, great, Vince thanks for the question. Clearly having a number of effects going on here, some of these are related to new products, strong demand for PowerCore Ultra and that allows us to drive stronger pricing based on product performance. Then we also have the new crop protection portfolio products that are launching Isoclast new insecticide that is doing quite well, and so we get a nice mix effect associated with that as well. Tim, what else would you add? TimGlenn: Jim, I think you touched on the big points, I mean, we're getting a tremendous benefit from mix and new technology adoption and that's very much having a positive impact on our results this year. So, and then we've got the natural benefit of being able to produce locally as well. It gives us a little bit of a hedge against currency. Operator : And next, we move to Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. JonasOxgaard: Good morning. Thank you. I was wondering, it looks like your performance this quarter vastly outpaced your main competitor. I realized that some of that might be North America pulling forward and realizing that price is in a different timeframe, but even Latin America and Asia, you're still outpacing them. Can you give us some highlights of what's going on here? Is it the share gain or is it just recognition? JimCollins: Thanks, Jonas, for the question. Part of it is, is as you have said, we deliver seed to growers on pretty much, as demand or real time basis. So, in North America, clearly this market, this season broke early and so really weather dictates, Mother Nature dictates kind of the flow of the business. You saw it in one of the charts that Tim was mentioning where just in the last three days of the quarter we had a $100 million worth of deliveries of seed in North America. So it starts with a story around the season, is really been favorable and we've gotten off to a great start based on timing. But then I would add, an intensity and a focus that our teams have had around the world. You saw it in our momentum that we carried through the fourth quarter of 2019. It rides on the back of one of the best lineups in portfolios that I've seen in my time with the business, both in seed and crop protection. It was also an intensity and a focus on value. And so we had our teams out there focused on pricing for and delivering on the value equation that we had. And then as we've said, we've made some key investments in markets around the world and our changes of our route to market. So that we're more focused and more connected to customers. So in a time like this where this crisis has unfolded, I really believe that business model, that route to market model is paying off in a huge way because we have a connection an ability to react, and agility that the way others go to market may not quite have. Tim, what else would you add to my comments? TimGlenn: I think you touched on that, clearly execution and new technology are a big part of what's helped support the performance so far this year. I think the question Jonas around market share, what I would tell you is I think it's a little bit early to call that right now just because of the uncertainty that we have in terms of what the final planted acres will be. So that'll be something that we're going to continue to watch. What we felt is very good about our book of business throughout the year. We carried a lot of positive momentum in many markets coming out of 2019. And it set us up for I think a really good start to this year. And I would say generally our product performance overall not just the new product and technologies in crop protection, but in terms of seed performance relative to the competition, has been really outstanding and been well received in the market. So, we feel good about where we're at. It's too early to call and we're anxious to continue to deliver especially in the Northern hemisphere as the markets play out here in the second quarter. Operator : And next we'll move to Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. SilkeKueck: Good morning. It's Silke Kueck for Jeff. How are you? In terms of your cost reduction program, you achieve like $70 million, after $230 million you're trying to achieve. Can you tell how much of that is sort of savings that are associated with like the shorter term programs you put in place to cancel travel and delay, non-essential hiring and off the $230 million that you had targeting this year, do you think that any of these savings will be a headwind in 2021 because some of these initiatives are really shorter term in nature? Thank you. JimCollins: Great question. Thanks. It clearly, we really have three things going on with some of the spending reductions we have the continuation of carrying forward on the synergy programs that we've had in place. So, there's a part of that that is still continuing to show up and we're committed to not only this year, but finishing out that overall commitment next year. So there's some durability in those savings as they roll, as we continue to roll those through. Then on top of that, there's the new productivity program that we've announced or execute to win initiative that is beginning to drive some cost reductions associated with those productivity areas. And you'll, you'll be familiar with some of the announcements that we've made around some additional restructurings globally to take advantage of that. But then third, there is no doubt that there are cost savings that are beginning to show up. You're at the end of first quarter and we'd expect to see more in the second quarters that are associated with the crisis. That's the stance that we've taken around working from home. So travel was much lower. We've certainly taken a very hard look at hiring, through the remainder of the year; our marketing, our promotion and our advertising spend also being affected. Some of those costs you would expect to return a little bit in into the next year. But by and large, we're taking a real critical look at all of these expenses. And I think what we've learned a little bit through this crisis is we found some new ways to work, some new tools to work and I'd expect that many of those costs will be able to count on as continued savings year over year. Greg, anything else that you would add to the explanation? GregFriedman: Yes. I just want to add that I would separate the 200 of synergies, the $30 million of productivity that was in our plan and we're executing against that plan. This is incremental 100 that Jim talked about that say a result of the crisis and specific actions that we're taking that Jim mentioned. We're going to take the opportunity to try to sustain as much of that as possible into 2021 and beyond. But some of those costs will return as things come back to normal. Operator : We'll move to Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Market. JoelJackson: Hi, good morning. This will be a tough question because it's like a second derivative, but I mean, everyone faster at asking about it the last two months. So, you know the 2021 set up in the late 2020 setup. So, you know, if we get trend yield here and it's a good crop in the US and what corn ethanol are doing, maybe you could talk about what you would see here for lower corn acres in 2021 in the US, how that could play out for your Q4 deliveries here and then how that fed into the reason to pull the full year guidance. Thanks. JimCollins: Great. Thanks, Joel for the question. So, part of the reason is for that it is some uncertainty around the setup for 2021 and that has an impact on our fourth quarter shipments of seed. Both the retail brand that we have been shipping we see some, earlier than our normal first quarter shipments that show up in the fourth quarter. And we're continuing to drive, our product portfolio and performance to try to get some advanced sales out there. So it's the uncertainty of that corn market that we're really watching. You\u2019ve got a few things going on there. You've got the ethanol demand situation, so we'll have a large harvest, we believe coming off this year and not having that ethanol demand to begin to take up that crop, depresses some commodity prices. On the opposite side of that, we have China and the purchases that they're making, and we're seeing strong indications by China today on what those purchases could like. When we sit back and take a macro look at it, are our assumptions right now is that we could see us 5 to 7 million acre of decline in corn and so that it's a little early to call that, but that's our working assumption right now. And Tim, anything else you would add to that? TimGlenn: No, I think, Jim, I think you're spot on. I mean, we feel really excited about where we're at right now because we've had over half of the US corn crop planted, we got about a quarter of the of the soybean crop, but you got to remember we got to get this crop harvested and produced throughout the season and plus, we've got two seasons in Brazil, we've got a summer corn season and spring season and then we got the second safrinha season all there before we would even plant again in the Northern Hemisphere. So, we got a long way to go here. But I agree with the Jim the indications would indicate lower corn acres for next year, but it's still within that 10 year range that we've operated in. And we've over a 10 year period, we've been in that call it 88 million to 97 million range for corn. So, we're still in that same range and they just slightly below average over that 10 year horizon. So, we've got a lot in front of us and clearly the economics of the crops are going to dictate as well as policies are going to have a huge impact that that are going to play out over the course of the year. Operator : And we'll move on to Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. AdamSamuelson: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping to get just any incremental color, doesn't get a lot of discussion today, and around enlist and kind of market performance. Is that now commercially in the market and it sounds like you're maybe a little less negative on soy seed pricing than you were in late January. So, help us think about that. And then a quick clarification, I think there was a comment around North America crop protection as being a lower kind of value quarter. So, there's a margin mix headwind, but there's also an allusion to strong enlists sales in the period in period in North America and the slides and so I just want to make sure I heard that right and reconciled that. JimCollins: Great, thanks. Thanks, Adam, maybe I'll start with a high level, I'll ask Tim to talk a little bit about enlist and how we're feeling about that line-up and then maybe, Rajan can talk a little bit more about the final part of that question. From a pricing perspective, you're right, we're feeling a little bit better about the discipline and the focus that we've had with our soybean prices in North America especially. We had guided as we entered into 2020 that it would be a competitive market and by and large, we've seen that at the same time, we deployed some very strong internal pricing discipline that allows us to manage our discounting with much tighter controls that we've had in the past. And so that's - we would estimate as we sit here today that we'll probably do better in soy pricing than we originally planned. And, and that's, I think, a real tribute to just the internal discipline that we have out there. We still have a lot of that market ahead of us, only about 40% of soybeans of our soybeans shipments have been delivered here. And that'll play out by March to the rest of the quarter. Do you want to talk a little bit about this Tim? TimGlenn: Yes, I'll just on the pricing; I just want to close up. They're saying we knew we were going to go into a really competitive season. We had other players in the marketplace to indicate that early with how they started the year and so we took extra steps to make sure we had a strong process in place so that we could manage those discounts internally, really just strong internal discipline. And I think, why we feel good and why we've been able to maybe or against reduced what we thought the discounting might be is really, I think, a testament to the strong performance that we got and the fact that we are getting over I think relative to the competition, we get the strongest portfolio products in the marketplace and customers are supporting that. So, one of the reinforce that on price and Rajan any comments they're on Enlist. JimCollins: Enlist as well as our product line-up in the first quarter. RajanGajaria: Sure, Jeff. Yes. Thanks to Adam for the question. So, related to Enlist, we are on track actually very excited about the launch here. We had said that about 20% of the market would be Enlist soybeans. We are seeing that we are on track to deliver that as a part of our portfolio and the whole adoption of the technology there to the demand for endless herbicides which is a precursor to have the soybean shipments will come also looks very exciting. So, we are on track for delivering against the performance of Enlist. That's true here obviously with what we are talking about with the Enlists we see in soybeans, but we continue to see good progress on that in cotton across the globe. We have some opportunities which we look at Enlist, so the whole Enlist system is on track to deliver. When to the question on the crop protection margin in the first quarter. You're right; we mentioned that if you think about our product mix, a lot of our new product launches where the margin expansion is there. We start seeing them in the second quarter and in the second half. In the first quarter it is primarily in North America where we have the herbicide business, we've got good differentiated products, but the margin on those are lower than our new product ramp up which we have. I would take the opportunity to tell you that we are on-track to deliver against our Crop Protection, new product launch opportunities that we see there. So just thought I'd reinforce that. Operator : And now we move to John Roberts with UBS. JohnRoberts: Thank you. I believe the bundling incentives are recorded completely in the Crop Protection segment. For the revenue that was involved how much was the total revenue involved and customers that took advantage of bundling so far? How is that split between seeds and crop protection? JimCollins: Yes. Thanks, John, for the question and you're right. You do see in that Crop Protection margin discussion in addition to the mix that that Rajan just mentioned. We do have some of those incentives that show up against Crop Protection revenue here in the first quarter. We'll benefit against that as those products start to flow and growers start to take delivery of those of those key purchases. We are excited about the opportunity to work with a grower to understand our availability of that Corteva we call it it's a we get to a seed opportunity, we get to see treatment opportunity, we get herbicides setup, and then as the season unfolds additional insecticides and fungicides in row crops primarily in North America. We had launched that program last year. We saw some initial successes, but we're really excited about some of the early successes we're seeing now as we get into the season. Anything else you would add to that Rajan? RajanGajaria: No, Jim, I think you covered the main points. The one thing which I would add is that we are really excited about how this program is going to continue to evolve because one of our biggest growth opportunities is to make sure that the Crop Protection business and how we have the footprint on the seed side can come together. Now, the way the program has been administered, it did have a pricing impact from grower incentives for the first quarter. But in terms of the overall growth prospects as this gets rolled out again for the second season, we are very optimistic about how we're going to help both our businesses continue to move forward. Operator : And we'll hear from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. DuffyFischer: Yes, good morning. I was having a hard time just bridging into Q2 because last season was so late, this season was so early, just to get that split, right. But if I take your 6% growth in the first half, that would be about an increase of about $550 million year-over-year for the half. You did that about that exact same number in Q1. So that would lead me to believe that sales in Q2 are flat excluding currency. So one, is that fair? And two, if that's the level, how should we think about margins this Q2 versus margins last Q2 again, excluding currency. JimCollins: Thanks Duffy. You're right on kind of how those sales are flowing kind of year-over-year. Again, we did carry some good momentum coming out of fourth quarter and the first quarter and you see that market recovery that we expected in North America as we saw that 13 million acres won't come back into planet area. The other thing you have going on is our pipeline. As Rajan mentioned, we start to see some of our newer products showing up more in the second quarter. So, Greg, anything else you'd add to the margin question? GregFriedman: Yes, absolutely. As you as take that top-line down to EBITDA. There is a currency impact that that does translate down to EBITDA as well. So, that would be a negative. But we mentioned earlier, the additional spending actions that we're taking resulting from COVID-19 working from home, reducing travel, reducing non-essential spend. All of those actions are going to help us further offset some of that impact as well. Operator : And next we'll move to P.J. Juvekar with Citi Group. P.J.Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good morning, and good to hear from you. You mentioned couple of things about increase cost, one was the increase seed cost due to unfavorable yields from last year. So can you talk about that? And then second one was higher royalty payments, probably for Roundup Ready 2. What was the impact of that? And then just related to these royalty payments, what\u2019s the long-term opportunity for Corteva to reduce your payments to buyer, and that\u2019s one of the key parts of your thesis for many investors. So just can you address that? Thank you very much. JimCollins: Great. P.J., thank you. Yes, we had guided as we built our plan for 2020, we guided that we would have some higher costs related to yields that we saw in 2019. And those are essentially unfolding exactly as we expected that they would. So nothing new there, those are falling through about like we have done. The royalties, you mentioned in our plan for this year. They are about on track with what we expected. We\u2019re going to have the units of Ready 2 Xtend. We had some slight adjustments though, as you know, we made the announcement back in January of our successful science evaluation of the Enlist E3 system and made a commitment to more aggressively launch and ramp up the Enlist. And that had a slight effect on our royalty rate as we take up those costs into COG. The final part of your question is a good one and I'll start and maybe ask Rajan to say few other words. We know that as we pivot and bring the Enlist trade and convert our portfolio from Roundup Ready 2 Xtend to Enlist E3, that there is a dramatic reduction in the royalty rates that we paid today. It's the timeframe by which we can make that conversion that we still understand. But through the mid to late 20s, we ought to be able to rotate ourselves completely out of a Roundup Ready 2 Xtend in favor of Enlist. Anything else Rajan, you would add to update that? RajanGajaria: No, I think you hit it the nail on the head. The one thing to clarify is that the increase is definitely limited only to the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend part of our business. And as that business shrink, you will see that royalty rate change. But we're really excited PJ about the whole ramp up of Enlist and that creates another opportunity for us to get royalty income coming in. And I think at this point of time we mentioned that 20% of the acres are going to be soybean and that in-licensing opportunity also continues to unfold in front of us. So we are on track to deliver. JimCollins: Greg, anything else you'd add on royalty? GregFriedman: Yes, just a couple of things. Number one, that the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend royalties, largely it's going to impact the second quarter, because our soybeans are typically delivered more into the second quarter. There is only a little bit in the first quarter. So, just from a timing perspective keep that in mind. Secondarily, this increase in royalty rate is a non-cash expense. It's an increase to the cash rate because we're amortizing over a shorter period of time. So it is a non-cash royalty expense. Operator : And we'll move on to Arun Vishwanathan with RBC Capital Markets. ArunVishwanathan: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I hope you're all well. I just wanted to go back to the outlook for 2020. So, arguably FX is definitely a variable and then the back half of the year in Latin America and other regions are also variables. In addition to those two items, I guess, what else would you call out as some things you're kind of particularly watching or particularly have emerged as greater concerns within the last quarter or two? Thanks. JimCollins: Great, thanks for the question. It really is those - its two major factors. It's FX rates related to our fourth quarter Brazil business. And we feel really good about the setup for that safrinha market and our product performance and the both seed and crop protection looks really good. So the demand side of that equation we feel good about. It's the FX effect of that 30% of our revenue that we deliver from Brazil in the second half of the year. The second element is related more to kind of North America demand for our seed shipments in the fourth quarter. As we began to take orders from growers, we began to book business and our seasonality has actually over time as we've launched our retail brands and done more in retail. We see demand for corn show up in fourth quarter. And we just have some uncertainty. As Tim mentioned, if we saw 5 million to 7 million acres of corn come out of the market going into next year still on average about an average season down around that 90 million acre, 88 million to 90 million acres. So it's not a huge downside. It's still more of an average season, but it is a changed year-over-year. And so we want to understand that demand change and that uncertainty before we drew up that guide. Operator : And our last question today will come from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. ChrisParkinson: Great, thank you very much. Can you just talk a little bit more about your Qrome ramp? Just what you're hearing initially from customers and your penetration expectations for this year? And then just over the intermediate term, let's say '21-'22. What's the best way to think about that? Thank you. JimCollins: Great. Thanks, Chris. Tim, do you want to update on Chrome? TimGlenn: Yes, Qrome launch has been very successful. We talked about essentially converting around 70% of our triple stack lineup into Qrome this year. And we've successfully been able to do that. So I think what you'll see over the next two years, Chris, is that it basically replaces the other triples and will become the standard chronic that we offer in that segment across North America. So in terms of contributor to performance, it was a contributor to first quarter. And it'll be contributed the first half performance and really helped us capture some price and value in the marketplace and in a tough challenging year. So we're excited and it is well received. And it will become our standard going forward. Playing out about like we thought, Megan Britt : So with that, I want to thank you for joining the call. We appreciate your interest in Corteva and on behalf of the entire Corteva team; I really wish you good health and safety. Operator : And that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.",

We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure where available is provided in our earnings release and on our website. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Collins : Thank you, Megan. It\u2019s great to be with you on the call today. Corteva has been a public company for over a year celebrating our one year anniversary in the second quarter. Scanning the unprecedented event that have punctuated our first year and [indiscernible] of the operational agility that we have demonstrated in the marketplace and the determination and integrity of the team that is shaping our company. Slide 4 captures the principles that are guiding our actions, during this challenging time. This quarter our teams were called to respond to continued impacts from the global pandemic, a 500 year flooding event at our manufacturing facility in Midland Michigan, and tragic events in United States that brought racial inequity to the forefront globally. We've maintained a common set of principles and values and how we're responding to these events that place employees safety and security, business continuity of our customers, and care and compassion for our communities at the heart of our response. I'm very proud of how our global team has operated through these challenges keeping our purpose of enriching lives in focus. Relative to COVID-19 employee safety and security continue as a top priority and the global crisis management structure that we have activated at the outset of the pandemic remains in place. We've also maintained our work-from-home stance where possible and enhance safety and security protocols at our work sites for essential personnel. In the second quarter we completed detailed planning for our ultimate return to work sites. We're also evaluating institutionalizing efficiencies again as a result of our current work stance particularly our digital capabilities that enable more flexible and cost effective work arrangements. Beyond employees safety we are also actively engaged in keeping our supply chains open and supporting our customers and communities. In May, our team safely managed an emergency site shutdown and ultimately a restart as a result of the flooding event in Midland Michigan with minimal costs or disruption to the business. Here we again leverage our supply chain resiliency and global asset footprint to mitigate product supply disruptions We were also active in the Midland Community contributing to the local United Way to support broader recovery efforts there. I'm proud to say that through all of this uncertainty, we never miss the ship. Recently tragic events that have taken place in the United States have put all of our inclusion and diversity practices in the spotlight. Corteva believes the basic principles of human dignity, equity, inclusion and diversity are essential to every business in every industry. The recent events make it clear that we have work ahead of us to build a fair and more equitable society. At Corteva, we acknowledge this opportunity and have taken swift and deliberate action to move these crucial conversations and the essential work needed to manifest change forward. We've increased focus on inclusion and diversity and equity efforts already in place in our organizations and within our communities to amplify the voices and programming vital to sustaining this important forward momentum. Turning to our strategic update for the quarter, progress our priorities for shareholder value creation is noted on slide 5. Starting with culture with an owners\u2019 mindset, our teams across the company are focused on reducing spending to both preserve cash and to help offset the impacts from the global pandemic. This focus resulted in $15 million in savings in the first half. These additional actions include the implementation of a hiring freeze, delaying employee promotions and relocations and holding our current work-from-home stance in place in several geographies for an extended period. These actions are added to our previous efforts to eliminate non-essential travel, incur marketing spend, eliminate large in-person meetings and scale our digital activities. Regarding capital allocation in May we fortified our balance sheet and liquidity position with the issuance of $1 billion in the long-term notes. We anticipate using a portion of the proceeds from the issuance to can turnout our entire year commercial paper borrowing needs to support seasonal working capital requirements. We're also evaluating additional capital deployment actions for the remainder of the year. On opportunistic M&A, acquiring the full ownership interest in the company and work to fulfill our commitment to return cash to shareholders. We returned approximately $250 million to shareholders in the form of quarterly dividends and share repurchases through the first half of 2020. Advancing our portfolio of innovative solutions, I'm pleased to report that in the second quarter we exceeded our expectations for Enlist E3 easily soybeans across our brands, scaling the technology platform to 17% of our soybean product volume in 2020. Looking forward, the recently issued Ninth Circuit Court Ruling on Enlist Duo gives farmers added confidence in our technology and we are working aggressively to further expand the seed volume available in the marketplace and in our portfolio in 2021. Beyond Enlist E3 soybeans new Crop Protection product launches continue to drive all both sales and earnings improvement. We remain on track to deliver a $100 million in earnings improvement from new Crop Protection products for the full year. On a priority on our best-in-class cost structure, we delivered $130 million in cost synergies and productivity to the first half of the year, exceeding the original target set for this timeframe. We remain on track to deliver $230 million for the full year. Finally, on above market growth in the first half organic sales were up 5% overall with growth in every region. Notably, we delivered low single digit price improvements in court seed and soybean seeds in North America for the half, capitalizing on the yield advantage for Chrome corn seed, the launch of Lumialza seed treatment and solid global demand were Enlist E3 soybeans. We also delivered strong organic results in Europe and Asia Pacific in both Seed and Crop Protection. In Latin America, we faced headwinds from Sharp currency devaluation, timing shifts and a formulation challenge in Vessarya fungicide that we expect to resolve in the near term. Finally, our results in North America were supported by the acreage rebound, but tempered by a less favorable corn acreage increase and Crop Protection market competitiveness. The next slide frames several of the market related drivers for the quarter. Moving to slide 6, while we expected to capitalize on more favorable weather conditions this year, the COVID-19 pandemic has created unexpected impacts across the agriculture sector. Though the ag industry has demonstrated resilience relative to other sectors, the global pandemic and economic downturn have impacted demand for the highest value of goods namely meat and ethanol. Lower demand for both products and anticipated build in US corn stocks weaken the corn commodity prices both into other crops at the outset of the North America planting season. From the 1st of March to the end of the quarter US corn prices have fallen sharply declining 11% over the course of the planting season and pulled down the 2020 corn planted acres. Based upon the USDA acreage report released at the end of June, we believe 92 million acres of corn were planted which represents a five million acre We believe 92 million acres of corn were planted, which represents a five million acre reversal in expectations between the March and June reports. This is one of the largest swings in USDA estimates in the last 20 years. The lower corn acreage rebound reduces some of our volume and margin opportunity in the second quarter. In addition to the deterioration in the US corn area expectations, the pandemic related slowdown has also driven significant currency exchange rate volatility. The strengthening of US dollar relative to several foreign currencies through the first half that impacted our ability to deliver plant growth particularly in Latin America where the Brazilian real has weakened more than 30% to the US dollar since the beginning of the year. Regarding trade expectations, currency volatility has impacted the relative prices between the major exports to. The China has recently increased purchases of corn and soybeans and wheat from the US, weak South America currencies have made South America grain offers to importing countries more competitive. Moving to slide 7, we show our key performance indicators for the first half. These indicators carry signposts of our success in overcoming some of the market adversity and highlight several execution imperatives for delivering a strong second half. Net sales on a recorded basis for the first half increased 2% versus the prior year. Currency, particularly in Brazil and Europe was a 3% headwind, 5% organic growth was propelled by a 4% improvement in volume and a 1% improvement in price driven by organic gains in the Seed segment in every region and continued new crop protection product growth in Europe and Asia Pacific. In Seed, organic sales were up 8% due to the acreage rebound and improved price in North America. Market share gains in Brazil and Europe corn and strong volume and price gains on new products particularly Qrome and PowerCore ULTRA. In crop protection organic sales increased 1% supported by continued growth in new products notably Arylex herbicide and Isoclast insecticide particularly offset by declines in Latin America and North America. Unfavorable timing, product formulation challenges, and market competitiveness suppressed our second quarter crop protection results. We have an opportunity to change this course in the second half. Operating EBITDA increased 3% and operating EBITDA margin improved by more than 20 basis points for the first half. In seed price and volume gains in all regions and productivity improvement drove a 160 basis point gain in margin for the segment. The crop protection earnings expansion from new product sales synergies and productivity improvements were overcome by unfavorable geographic and product mix. Currency reduced earnings by approximately $110 million for the first quarter. During the quarter, we have taken steps to limit the further downside risk on currency by deploying new financial hedging instruments. SG&A as a percent of net sales increased by approximately 15 basis points in the first half. We made early progress to deliver on our spending actions. However, this was more than offset by spending in the form of higher commissions in seed, ERT costs and product launch costs. These indicators affirm a solid regional execution into seed that leveraged our differentiated technology position advantage route to market and flexible supply chain to overcome the challenges related to COVID-19. In crop protection, our results through the first half demonstrate the continued adoption of our new and differentiated products while also highlighting areas where we can and will do better. Slide 8 provides an overview of the key areas of momentum as well as the challenge related to the operating EBITDA for the first half. Starting with seed pricing, which is still an area of focus. We successfully extracted price improvement in corn globally consistent with the value of our portfolio, which was largely supported by the increased penetration of Chrome in our broader US product portfolio. We estimate that corn delivered approximately $80 million in pricing through the first half. As we've now completed the bulk of our deliveries in soybeans, I can also confirm that we exceeded our initial expectations on US soybean price with price gains of 1%. This outcome is as a result of our strong execution in the marketplace despite intense competitiveness. As I noted earlier, new product sales acting according to plan. We are executing on synergies and productivity as we had expected and offsetting the seed cost of goods sold and increased royalty cost headwinds, we anticipated for the year. Now though we made early progress on spending actions that helped to partially offset the increases of SG&A through the half. This is an area where we will gain more traction in the second half. As I noted earlier, currency was a headwind on the first half. During the quarter we took pricing actions to took partially off for instance partially in Latin America and we launched a new hedging programs to mitigate currency risk notably in Brazil for the second half. Finally, there were several headwinds that emerged in the second quarter that dampened our first half performance. The first was is in corn acres in the United States, which were lower than we expected by 3 million acres and five million acres lower than the USDA\u2019s earlier estimates as I mentioned earlier. Remember a one million acre change in corn in the US represents approximately $20 million in operating EBITDA. Second, we have a formulation challenge with our Vessarya fungicide product in Brazil that resulted in product returns that we will rework and reposition in the channel in the third quarter. On herbicide volumes, we saw increased market competitiveness in soybean herbicides in the United States, which impacted our volumes there. In Latin America last year, we recognized $80 million in net sales in the second quarter on an early start to the season largely in herbicides. We are seeing a more normal start to the season in Brazil this year, and expect to see those volumes realized in the third quarter. With that, I\u2019ll now hand the call to Greg. Greg Friedman : Thank you, Jim. Since we have covered first half performance, I\u2019ll provide more insight into our second quarter results on slide 9. Net sales of $5.2 billion were down 7% versus prior year on 4% more volumes, currency headwinds at 3% and a 1% decline from portfolio. Price was a 1% increase for the quarter, primarily due to pricing actions in Latin America to offset currency. Early seed deliveries in North America shifted volumes into the first quarter. This was coupled with the headwind related to a strong start for the Latin America Crop Protection season in the prior year. Additionally, competitive pressures in North America herbicides contributed to lower volumes in the second quarter, partially offsetting this was continued penetration of new products in Crop Protection where sales increased 8% for the second quarter versus prior year. This increase includes the unfavorable impact due to rework from the Vessarya fungicide sales in Latin America. Turning to operating EBITDA, we reported $1.24 billion or a 15% decline versus the second quarter of 2019. Overall, declines were led by lower volumes in Seed due to seasonal shifts in North America, higher SG&A costs and the unfavorable impact of currency. Partially offsetting headwinds in the quarter, we continue to see realization of synergies and productivity along with early progress on spending actions as a result of the global pandemic. Our operating EBITDA margins were equally pressured in the quarter down 230 basis points from the prior year. Again, this is largely due to the shift in volumes and mix to the first quarter and headwinds from currency. For the quarter, operating earnings per share were a $1.26, down a 11% from the prior year period. Turning to slide 10 for an update on our 2020 guidance. Last quarter, we suspended our guidance due to the heightened level of uncertainty related to the global pandemic and economic downturn predominantly around currency and the set up for 2021 demand. Today, we are updating our financial guidance for the year. Our guidance does not contemplate any further operational disruptions, significant changes in customer demand or ability to pay or further acceleration of currency impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting with net sales, we expect more than $700 million in currency headwinds for the full year, partially offset by pricing and the North American market rebound, resulting in 1% to 2% growth over the prior year on a reported basis. On an organic basis, we expect growth between 5% and 6% with price and volume gains globally. Turning to operating EBITDA. We now expect to deliver a range of approximately $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion. This guidance reflects nearly $500 million of operating EBITDA headwinds from the prior year due to the currency and the onetime gains of asset divestitures in 2019. For operating EPS we expect to deliver between $1.25 and $1.45 per share. We have provided detailed modeling guidance in the appendix of our presentation. To help illustrate our expectations on guidance slide 11 details some key assumptions on the second half. Starting with sales, we expect organic growth of 6% to 7% in the second half over prior year. This is largely due to growth in Latin America volumes in crop protection which includes a favorable timing shift of $80 million in sales compared to the prior year. Offsetting this is an anticipated reduction in seed deliveries in North America for the fourth quarter. Specifically, we have considered the uncertainty around our fourth quarter seed deliveries in the US as market dynamics for the 2021 season continue to take shape and we have appropriately adjusted our expectations. On pricing the large part of the year-over-year improvement is in Latin America. This improvement is predominantly due to changes in local prices as a result of devaluation of the Brazilian real. In crop protection new products will continue to ramp globally building on our first half momentum. n total we expect an incremental $150 million a in new product sales for the second half compared to the prior year. Our estimate includes the sales related to rework Vessarya that negatively impacted our first half results. On currency, we are estimating an approximate $500 million in sales headwinds over prior year largely due to the devaluation of the real. This translates into an approximate $300 million headwind to operating EBITDA. During the quarter we launched new hedging programs to mitigate further downside risk most notably in Brazil. I'm confident that we have put the necessary tools in place to manage future downside risks for the year and provide more predictability in our forecast. Turning to cost, we remained committed and fully expect to deliver on the full year merger-related cost synergies and productivity actions targeting about $100 million for the back half to hit our full year commitment. For SG&A and R&D, we expect costs to be approximately $20 million higher if our over prior year. Higher investments to advance the pipeline in Crop Protection along with the costs to launch new products and operating expenses associated with the ERP implementation are driving the increase. Partially offsetting this are the actions we are taking in the organization to curtail spending. I\u2019ll now hand it over to Tim for some perspective on our sales execution for the second half. Tim Glenn : Thanks, Greg. Turning the slide 12 for the second half our fundamental priorities for me unchanged and how now we look to win in the market. Talking closely with former customers and channel partners to create demand for high value solutions and delivering that technology to our customers to help drive productivity in their operations. Starting first with global execution, our regional teams are focused on continuing to penetrate markets with new technologies particularly in crop protection with new products like Arylex and Rinskor herbicides in Europe and Asia Pacific and Isoclast insecticide in Latin America. We're also managing some headwinds in the portfolio based on strategic decisions we've made to exit certain products globally and ramp down low margin third-party products. Latin America where approximately 40% of our second half sales are concentrated, our sales teams are leveraging our strong position in corn seed to deliver on the summer and Safrinha season into Brazil. This includes continued penetration of both our global seed brands and Pioneer and Brevant in our differentiated seed traits like PowerCore ULTRA. In crop protection we're focused on continuing to drive growth in fungicides with strong market demand for Vessarya. Insecticide is another key area of success for us in the second half, as we continue to drive growth in high value products like spinosyns and Isoclast. In North America given the adjustments on fourth quarter delivery expectations that Greg mentioned we will continue to work closely with customers as we begin collecting seed orders towards the end of the third quarter and customers begin formulating planting plans for the 2021 crop season. We'll also work closely with channel partners to secure orders for the upcoming season and position product to capture the value we generate for our yield advantage portfolio. This includes leveraging the strength and velocity of our Enlist soybean system to ramping up for expected strong demand for the upcoming season during the fourth quarter. I'm confident that we have the right actions in place to address our second quarter gaps and we have a team that is determined to deliver for the year. Bottom line all regions will execute in the second half. Bottom line all regions will execute in the second half. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Rajan. Rajan Gajaria : Thank you. Tim. Turning to slide 13, I\u2019ll respect spec through a few notable examples and key drivers of how we are driving our performance in 2020. Starting on the left with Seed, our Qrome corn technology is in its first full year of lunch and a significant contributor to the pricing execution we delivered in seed for the first half. For the second half, we will need to maintain this momentum as Qrome is an integral part to providing the high yielding performance our customers are looking to secure. Moving to Enlist E3 Soybeans, here continuing strong adoption is enabling sales growth. We expect Enlist E3 will contribute more than $200 million in net sales in 2020. Importantly, this progress is further reinforced by the value we expect the full system to bring and with the recent decision as Jim mentioned we are seeing increased farmer confidence in our Enlist herbicides. We are focused on continuing to deliver on our plan to further expand the presence of this technology in the marketplace and in our portfolio in 2021. We are working closely with our contracted grower to ensure that we are managing production to align with continued strong demand. Turning to Crop Protection, our portfolio of new products continues to deliver significant growth across various crops and geographies and its targeted to contribution an estimated $1 billion in sales for 2020 and expected 33% improvement over prior year. For the second half, we're expecting $150 million in incremental sales growth over prior year to deliver on our guidance. The balance, diversity and new mode of action of the new patented active ingredients is a cornerstone of the Crop Protection strategy. Molecules like Arylex, Rinskor, Isoclast and Zorvec are all a part of our business that is delivering a rapid ramp up in volumes. Another key differentiated active we have is a Spinosyn insecticide, which is expected to contribute approximately $750 million in net sales for 2020, a double-digit improvement over prior year. The majority of the 2020 growth is weighted to the second half in key markets such as Latin America, very key strong demand for the technology in a growing market. For 2020, we estimate that the [indiscernible] segment of the insecticide market is growing between 3% and 5%. We continue to deliver increased volumes from our capacity expansion investment and are on track to increase by more than 50% by 2023. Bottom line, these new technologies are an important growth catalyst for a Seed and Crop Protection portfolio and represent a critical part of our plan to deliver in the second half. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim. Jim Collins : Thank you, Rajan. To close, despite the rebound in the North America market and encouraging growth in our key technologies, 2020 has progressed, it's a very challenging year given the global health crisis and associated economic downturn. Setting currency aside, we're seeing solid fundamental performance in Seed, our new herbicide offerings and across our insecticide portfolio, which is providing momentum for the second half. As such, I am confident we have the necessary strategy in place to deliver on our updated 2020 guidance. So we have neutralized the downside risk on currency, we also recognized that market volatility is still a factor. So we\u2019re working to accelerate more aggressive efforts on spending, increasing volumes for high demand products and securing more Enlist E3 seed volume for the 2021 season. We know a lot can happen in a growing season and we are closely monitoring crop conditions in the US and Latin America as well as the broader market backdrop, including further COVID related impacts to ensure that we are adequately adapting and adjusting our plans to deliver for the full year. So I\u2019ll now turn it back to Megan. Megan Britt : Thank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I'd like to remind you that our cautions on forward looking statements, non-GAAP measures and pro forma financials apply to both our prepared remark and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today we'll hear from Joel Jackson. Joel Jackson : Jim, Greg, I wonder if you can help you know which the prior guide you have before expanded to about $2.2 billion EBITDA if you guided down about $22 million now. As specific and granular as possible can you help bridge you know to prior guide to the current guide all the buckets. And I guess it's too early to get to 2021, but is there any idea you know where you might see some drivers headwinds and tailwinds anything you can quantify the 2021 would be helpful. Jim Collins : Yeah great. Thanks Joel for the question. So you're right, we can -- it's actually pretty straightforward when you think about the previous guide of 2.2%, it comes down to two main elements. There's about $400 million of currency headwind versus that guide that we gave back in January and that is COVID-related due to a basket of currencies everywhere in the world. Brazil being the biggest component of that, but it's a -- it's a number of currencies. The second element is just some market softening. Part of that was the three million acres that that left us here right at the end of the second half, that that\u2019s about $60 million per our formula of $20 million for every yard million acres. And then some softening that we're seeing in the fourth quarter that it's also COVID-related primarily ethanol corn demand commodity pricing and that's another $40 million. So you add those altogether, there's $500 million of headwind versus that previous guide $400 million currency $100 million of it is market-related. And so we've worked hard throughout this first half to offset about half of that $500 million, some of that is seed, corn pricing. So our first half very strong performance in North America around corn price, soybean pricing a lot of predictions at the beginning of the year that we would fall short on soybean pricing and we off obviously -- we drove very strong performance there. And some of that is rest of world volume. So if you look at our seed business in places like Europe, we're up low-teens. If you look at Asia-Pacific we're up high-teens and if you look at Latin America we're up high 20% in terms of rest of the world our seed business. So really strong rest of the world performance. And then overall Crop Protection pricing and volume is part of that offset and then we've got some spending actions that we've taken. So overall down $500 million back about $250 million on actions that we've taken and that gets you to the midpoint of the new guide that we put out there. We believe this guide is a solid base. I've got a lot of confidence in it and so does the team and we're all working hard from now through the end of the year to go grab as many of the upsides as we can. I think a final point to make about the plan that we have here today versus what we gave you in January is pretty much everything else in that plan. Our pricing programs, our selling expense, the projects that we had in place to drive productivity, the synergies that are flowing through, the COGS improvement program, you know what all of that stuff has played out exactly according to plan. So big news here $400 million currency, a $100 million of market both of those COVID related and we're working hard to offset half of that today and working on that other half through the remainder of the year. Now on 2021, you know it's a little early to be talking about 2021, but if you just step back for a moment and think about all the things I just talked about the momentum that we're carrying in the underlying business the organic price volume growth that you're seeing both in Seed and Crop Protection, we're going to have another strong seed year next year, I think firm is well-positioned, Enlist will see the ramp starting now, we've got that launched and some additional work on COGS, on Crop Protection that pipeline is still delivering, this Spinosyn capacity starting come into play and we\u2019ll get additional chemistry business from Enlist that is sprayed over the top of those Enlist acres and then will still have the final year of our synergies and additional productivity. So all those things had you know I feel really good about the underlying foundation of the business and the momentum that we would be carried into it start in 2021. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move to David Begleiter. David Begleiter : James, just looking back \u2013 thank you. Just looking back at this growing season in North America, what do you think the ability of share market share both beans and corn this past season? Jim Collins : Yeah David. You know our first mission in North America this year was focused on value. We were very disciplined in driving new processes around pricing especially in corn and as I talked about a minute ago in soybeans. There has a lot of predictions that was \u2013 and it's always a competitive year, but I couldn't be prouder of the team. And so first and foremost, we focused on value rather than you know specifically focusing on share. So it's a little too early right now to call market share even though we've got kind of the macro numbers from USDA in terms of where we think planted acres came out and obviously we've got our visibility. You know it really matters exactly where those acres came out there in some parts of the country where we're stronger. And so we really got to get this down to a county level. So we're in the process of working through that. I can say pretty confidently we saw some share gains in other parts of the world. Tim, do you want to talk a little bit about those areas. Tim Glenn : Yeah Jim. I think we're very confident that we gain share in the past to premier season that wrapped up here in the first quarter and also in terms of Europe for both corn and sunflowers both significant businesses for us. So it's as you say if it's too soon to call we had to get a little bit more granularity about where those final acres are and ultimately be able to get down to the details to be able to make a call on our market share for the US. David Begleiter : Okay. Thanks, Tim. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move to Jonas Oxgaard. Jonas Oxgaard : I was just wondering, I realize this a little bit early, but I was wondering if you could talk about your expectations for Enlist\u2019s next year and how are you looking at the two sales as well? Jim Collins : Yes. Great, Jonas. Thanks. Thanks for the question. You know for this year for 2020, we did see very strong performance with -- with system and this was -- I would say really our very first full year of commercial launch. So we had originally expected that about 10% of our seed units would be Enlist and then we were happy to report and talk to you about it earlier that we were at 17% of our seed volumes. And then we -- we now believe that more than 20% of the acres in the US were -- were Enlist risk acres. Tim Glenn just had a grower meeting here just -- just two or three days ago and everybody is really excited about the system and how it performed and -- and they're all you know ready to sign up for acres going into 2021. So the other thing that I think gives us some -- some positives here are also some momentum is the decision that we just saw in the Ninth Circuit Court, the Enlist dual registrations continuation. It really sends one more message to growers that it reinforces that they can count on this that they can have confidence in the technology. So we are preparing for a significant ramp up in the 2021 season. We're working with as many of our production growers as we can to try to maximize the seed units that we would have available. And so right now, we believe that acres can grow by about 50% moving to roughly a third of the soybean acres in the marketplace. And then inside Corteva, we think, we can more than double our Enlist seed volumes for 2021 for Enlist E3. And we're clearly going to continue provide you more updates as we work through our production plan, so that takes us from maybe the 17% or so that we're here this year to kind of the low 30% for our seed units going forward. But obviously a lot of that's going to depend on our ability to go out and secure additional supplies. On the chemistry side, we saw about two thirds of the planted acres received a treatment of Enlist chemistry, and what we\u2019d expect that trend to continue as we see the acres expand, and we're going to be in a great shape in terms of production to be able to meet that demand, if it is a little bit higher, we'll have the chemistry and the ability to go after it. So, Rajan, anything else you would add to that? Rajan Gajaria : No, I think, Jim, you\u2019ve covered it. But just overall if you think about that Enlist system Jonas, we\u2019ll be looking at north of half a billion dollars of sales this year, that includes the soybean, other crops globally and the herbicide, and we have a track of doubling that in 2021 just based up on the adoption numbers that Jim spoke about. So it\u2019s playing off very well based up on everything we discussed and excited about the Enlist in the bigger part of our portfolio of next year. Jonas Oxgaard : Thanks, James. Operator : And next we\u2019ll move onto Vincent Andrews. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Good morning \u2013 thank you. Good morning everyone. Just want to understand the hedging \u2013 can you hear me? Jim Collins : Yeah. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Sorry. Just want to understand the hedging comments a bit both in terms of, I believe you said you are implementing a new type of strategy than what you\u2019ve done in the past, so if you can help us understand that? And then just more specifically that the comment on the $300 million of EBITDA ex-hedges, can you understand -- can you help us understand how much that would be, if you hadn\u2019t hedged, and is there any risk that if the hedges roll off, the currency stays the same way that that \u2013 you know the benefit with the hedges becomes a risk for 2021? Jim Collins : Yeah. Thanks, Vincent. Maybe I'll just make a few comments here and I'll ask Tim and Greg to say few points. So as we mentioned in the opening comments, you know with $700 million of currency related headwinds in sales and about $400 million in operating EBITDA and a big chunk of that is Brazil, some of the European currencies are in part of that as well. And so we have a few tools, the first tool in that list is our \u2013 these are uses of price. And then we've got new tools that I\u2019ll have Greg talk about that that are related to hedging instruments. And so you know what the hedges allow us to do is to manage to go forward volatility, pricing allows us to kind of recover that value, and then we have some natural hedges with local production that we do in some of those markets. So why don\u2019t we start, Tim, do you want to talk a little bit about our pricing strategy is to go out ahead of currency? Tim Glenn : Yeah. Absolutely, Jim. So pricing is clearly one of the key tools we have to help offset currency. And this year we saw a tremendous amount of volatility particularly I think February, March, April, and it was always moving against us. In some cases we were really limited in terms of how we could offset that currency because it was after we'd already priced and negotiated a sale with a customer, we saw that in both Europe and in Latin America particularly in the first half. But as we move through the first half and we look forward to the bulk of our business particularly in Latin America that happened in the second half of the year we were able to go out there and kind of pullback in our pricing and we actually did that at least a couple of times during the season and re-price based off of where currencies were and obviously we've got to be aware of where we sit from a competitive standpoint and other options that customers have. But we were able to make a pretty significant dent in what that potential currency impact could have been in the second half through those pricing actions. And certainly as we look towards the latter part of this year and into 2021 we're in all markets where we've had erosion due to currency to help offset that and regain what we could not offset this year. Greg? Greg Friedman : Great. Thanks. So our first item of defense as Jim and Tim mentioned is pricing. The second item of defense here is financial hedging. And just -- let me clarify part of the question that you had, you asked about the $300 million hedges what\u2019s really we're saying here is there is $400 million of currency exposure $300 million of that in the second half of the year and that $300 million is excluding the impact of pricing not excluding the impact of hedging. So just again on tap the impact is a little bit, more than 70% of our currency exposure is in Brazilian real and that exposure is heavily weighted to the second half of the year. The other keys of large exposure is related to European currencies, but that business is largely completed in the first half of the year and so that is already in our first half results. So working very closely with our commercial teams, who as Tim mentioned are out there booking business in the first half of the year for delivery in the third and the fourth quarter. We've been able to put financial hedges on those transactions to ensure that we lock-in the priced and offset any future volatility due to move-ins in currency rates. So this financial hedging strategy has been able to give us some confidence and predictability in our earnings in the second half of the year. I would also mention that in the past and currently we also do hedge our balance sheet from a net monetary assets perspective and that includes our receivables and that process and program does continue as well. Operator : And next we'll hear from Jeff Zekauskas. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi. Good morning. I also have a question on the currency issues. I think on slide 11 you said the EBITDA headwind would be about $300 million in the second half. Can I think in your prepared remarks you said that the sales effect in the second half would be about $500 million. So $300 million on $500 million is about 60% and normally I would think that the EBITDA effect would be pretty close to your EBITDA margin level a little bit more than 20%. And so I would have thought the currency effect would have been maybe $110 million something like that. Why is the EBITDA effect so large relative to the sales total if the sales total is $500 million? Greg Friedman : Yeah. So the largest impact is really on the sales line. And that does translate largely into earnings because of the pricing impact or if offset by the pricing impact. So we were \u2013 what we feel the downside in revenue does largely translate into earnings. There\u2019s a couple of offsets there. One is where we're able to recapture some price and the other is where we have natural hedges in place for both seed and crop protection in the local area. And we don't have as much of an offer because a lot of our manufacturing of crop protection is in the US. So we're producing the product for the Crop Protection in the US moving in as part of our supply chain into Brazil. And so we don't have that natural hedge protection there. If you recall, when we talked about our supply chain last \u2013 on the last call, we mentioned at about 65% of our Crop Protection supply was actually US based. Operator : And next we'll hear from P.J. Juvekar. P.J. Juvekar: Jim, I have a comment and then a question. And my comment is that, sometimes your reserves can be very confusing, because you have pull forward demand in certain region or pushing back of seeds and chemicals because of weather et cetera. So if it would be easier to understand your reserves, if you align your quarters with the planting cycle, and that's what the old Monsanto did, when you know they had the same issue, and so they had March, April and May together, because that\u2019s the planting season and June, July, August together, because that\u2019s the application season. So that\u2019s just a suggestion. I'm not saying you should do that, but that would make it easier for investors to understand the company. Jim Collins : Yes. Yes. Thanks P.J. for the comment, you know you're exactly right that the timing of the ag market in the northern hemisphere, the first quarter second quarter split for the financial result is really, really difficult, because you know the season unfolds differently every single year, and so calling out, which is why we talk a lot about our business on a first half basis. It provides a more seasonal view of the results and then we can kind of talk about the Southern Hemisphere in a seasonal basis in the second half. We have discussed a lot about adjusting our fiscal calendar to be more in line with the cropping calendar and you know we're working right now to get audited financials and some history behind our belt. So that when we can make that change you know we can do it appropriately. We've got some financial systems, our ERP systems that we're currently you know kind of rewiring now to bring it all together. So we want to get the ERP system kind of lockdown and ready to go and then we're going to take a hard look at making that movement making that adjustment. Do you had a question P.J. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Thank you. And my question is I mean your figures also were down only 2% organically after being up 27% in 1Q. Jim Collins : Yeah. P.J. Juvekar: So clearly you know Enlist E3 launch is going well as you ramp up Enlist E3 next year, how much of that will be in the Pioneer germplasm. And then if you can just talk about how much kind of germplasm of fee on the Enlist you will pay to Styne this year? Thank you. Jim Collins : Great let me just talk about CP volumes in 2Q for just a moment. You know this quarter was to your previous point a little bit of an aberration. We had some you know we had a very early start to the Latin-America season last year so there was a bunch of herbicides business that was in 2Q last year. We're going to get all of that in 3Q as a matter of fact I have the orders in hand right now to deliver most of that. The other reason is that CP results in 2Q are a little bit light, is this Vessarya issue that we talked about. We've got a fantastic fungicide in Brazil, growers it has tremendous performance. So there is no issue with the product performing itself growers and get their hands on it. It\u2019s just as formulation issue, meaning that we need to hold it a little bit later, little tighter, little closer, it\u2019s the right when the demand is needed. And so we have to pull some back and rework it and get it ready to go its stage in the warehouse ready to rock when the season unfolds. But because of that rework and pulling it back and created a little bit of depression in 2Q as well. So all of that comes back to us in the second half and as a matter of fact on an organic basis, if I looked at kind of the full year kind of CT guide when the second half kind of plays out like we think you know we're going to be high single digits organically in sales in our Crop Protection segment. So with respect to Enlist, Rajan, do you want to talk a little bit about that. Rajan Gajaria : Sure Jim. I think you covered it in your comments earlier, but when you think about Enlist P.J. for the whole market we believe that we are going to get to a third of the market next year. This year was more than 20%, so the Enlist E3 soybean market and the technology is going to be a third of acres next year. Related to our own germplasm, we feel that we are going to double the number we have. So let\u2019s say between 35% and 40% right now is when we are looking at all the production and we\u2019ll decide finally, but really this all hands on this trying to ramp up that technology significantly and looking forward to seeing how that adoption goes into the market. It\u2019s very exciting at this point of time with all the feedbacks we are getting from customers and our team is waiting. Operator : And next we'll hear from John Roberts. John Roberts : Thank you. Good morning. Are you ramping down production of seed with the extend trade this season or do you need to actually produce for inventory flexibility or because of the minimum royalty arrangement that you have? Jim Collins : Yeah, thanks. Thanks John. So obviously a lot of the plan for production for -- for extend is out there. And so the main message here is we're going to have choices for our growers no matter how this -- how this really plays out and you know we're watching that situation closely. Thanks, john. Operator : And we\u2019ll move on to Chris Parkinson. Chris Parkinson : Good morning, sorry about that [indiscernible]. Thank you. So it's clear that you know there were a few moving parts in the Brazil CP in 2Q performance including the difficult comp you mentioned in your prepared remarks. And then the reformulation issue in the Vessarya the countryside. Can you speak to you know the performances parse out those issues and just kind of break down your outlook for the second half especially in the formulation issue and just how you think about your portfolio is normalized growth rate in the new region for the second half of 2020 as well as how we should begin to think about 2021? Thank you very much. Jim Collins : Yeah. Yes, Chris. So really the two main issues $80 million of Vessarya or $80 million of sales that were in the second quarter last year that that will now recognize in this -- in the back half of this year in 3Q. And like I said I have those orders in hand. No -- no concerns about that at all and Vessarya is -- is all of that those sales we had last year will have again this year we anticipate. So it\u2019s a really strong product. So that\u2019s the way to think about Latin America as is just a little bit of an aberration around reporting. Go forward strong performance with our insecticide business in Latin America in the second half as well Isoclast is really setting up to be a real strong contributor. So as I said in -- I think one of the previous answers here if I look at this guide and the CP business for the full year at the end of 2020 you know we're going to be in the high single-digits on that revenue line organically x currency. So we feel really good about you know kind of where our competitive performance sits versus the market. Thanks, Chris. Operator : And our final question today we'll hear from Luke Washer. Luke Washer : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about your supply chain, I know you know with regard to the market COVID you doesn\u2019t had a large impact. But have you re-evaluate your supply chain kind of in light of the COVID any disruption or you\u2019ve taken any actions that the diversify your project? Jim Collins : Yeah. Luke thanks. You know first of all a very large percent of our portfolio. I think the number is 80% of our Crop Protection portfolio is dual source at least from two sources and a big chunk of that is out of the United States. One of those set the sources would be out of US, I think the number is north of 60% of our -- of our active ingredient. So we already have tremendous resiliency and flexibility and key message there. You don't wake up the first day of this COVID crisis and decide to diversify your supply chain. This is something we've been working on for years and have really paid off for us. So as the crisis rolled through Asia, we sourced from Europe and in the US and as we had some things that hit the US like the flooding in Midland, we were able to pivot and -- and source those products from Asia-Pacific. So you know no additional -- additional changes we feel really good about where we stand today. Operator : With that we conclude the question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Megan Britt for any additional or closing the remarks. Megan Britt : Thank you. Before we close the call today I wanted to remind everyone of the upcoming investor webcast on August 17. During this virtual event, Jim and Greg will provide strategic updates, including portfolio updates on key product launches, specifically our planning underway to accelerate Enlist E3 could be in penetration next year. We look forward to your attendance on that call. With that, we're going to close the call. Thank you so much for joining. Operator : And that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Megan Britt, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Megan Britt : Good morning and welcome to the third quarter 2020 earnings conference call for Corteva. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Jim Collins, Chief Executive Officer and Greg Freedman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Tim Glenn, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer and Rajan Gajaria, Executive Vice President of Business Platforms will join the live Q&A session at the end of the call. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement remarks during this call, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of the Corteva website and through the link to our webcast. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, which are subject to risks and uncertainties including those on Slide 2 and in our SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially. We provide a pro forma basis discussion and our earnings release and slides, unless otherwise specified all historical financial measures presented today, exclude significant items, which can be found in the schedules that accompany our earnings release. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure where available is provided in our earnings release and on our website. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Collins : Thank you, Megan and welcome to the participants joining the call today. Starting on Slide 4, three quarters through 2020, our teams continue to demonstrate resilience in the face of persistent market volatility as a result of the pandemic. This has created a very dynamic operating environment, in which we have worked aggressively to keep our employees and customers safe, our supply chains resilient, and our growth commitments on track. Considering the uncertainty that remains relative to the pace of the economic recovery, we regularly stress test our strategy and growth prospects under a variety of different scenarios, and we have confidence in the durability of our plan and our ability to deliver our midterm targets. Foundational to our confidence is our success in driving organic net sales growth in both reporting segments and across all regions year-to-date. Each quarter, since the onset of the pandemic, our teams have been challenged to continuously identify levers in our control to mitigate headwinds. I am proud of how our teams continue to respond with agility and discipline. As I consider our path ahead, we have the products, the route-to-market and the manufacturing strategy in place to deliver our future. We also have the productivity mindset to digitize and transform our cost structure to create meaningful margin expansion. Through disciplined and focused execution, we will realize the full operating leverage available from the organic growth that we extract from the marketplace. I am confident in our ability to deliver on our midterm targets. Though we have faced an inordinate number of challenges from exogenous forces yet we continue to use those challenges to sharpen our organization, this is evident in our actions to broaden our approach to manage earnings volatility from foreign currency exposure. Greg will share additional detail about our approach later. Finally, before I move on to the financial update, I wanted to highlight that our confidence in our growth objectives and our expanded capability to manage volatility, reinforced the decisive short-term actions we are taking on our capital return agenda. We are accelerating the return of cash to shareholders and intend to make strong progress on our $1 billion share repurchase program with an expectation to complete the program by the end of 2021, that\u2019s six months ahead of our original timeline. So moving to Slide 5 and an update on our financial performance. organic mix sales were up 9% in the quarter versus last year, propelled by price and volume improvements on strong performance in our Crop Protection segment. Currency was an 11% headwind in the quarter and more than offset the gains in volume and price. Looking at our results at the regional level, Latin America is the most significant region in the third quarter and volumes were up 25% relative to last year. A recovery from the decline experienced in the second quarter, as a result of timing shifts. Our momentum here is setting the stage for a strong finish to the year. Price increased 5% versus prior year, mostly on continued execution to offset currency. These volume and price gains more than offset the 24% unfavorable impact from currency devaluation. Organic sales were up 6% year-to-date, and volume and price growth in both Seed and Crop Protection demonstrating our teams focused execution and ability to extract value in the marketplace for our innovation despite the challenging operating environment. Our above market performance in Europe and Asia Pacific across Seed and Crop Protection underpinned our strong execution year-to-date. Shifting to operating EBITDA. We delivered 14% improvement for the third quarter and 5% improvement year-to-date. Now, this represents margin expansion of more than 120 basis points for the quarter and an approximate 60 basis point improvement year-to-date. Currency has reduced earnings by about $200 million year-to-date. So, considering this 11% earnings headwind from currency on a year-to-date basis, we are seeing tremendous momentum in our underlying business and alignment with our midterm targets. These results affirmed solid regional executions that benefited from our differentiated technology position, our advantage route to market and agile supply chain to overcome challenges related to the global pandemic to drive margin expansion. Moving to Slide 6 and a more in-depth look at our performance in the Seed segment. Net sales for the third quarter were down predominantly due to timing shifts. The 2019 unprecedented weather related delays shifted North America deliveries into the third quarter. A return to a more normalized North America planting season means, we recognized those sales in the second quarter for this year. Year-to-date organic sales grew 6% due to the acreage rebound and improved price in North America, market share gains in Brazil and Europe corn and strong volume and price gains on new products, particularly Qrome and PowerCore ULTRA and Enlist E3 soybeans. Gains in both volume and price were broad-based with all regions, delivering improvement. Overall, price and volume gains and productivity drove an approximate 250 basis point margin benefit for the segment year-to-date. As we noted last quarter, supporting our results in Seed is a strong year-over-year price improvement in both corn and soybeans, both up low single-digits, driven by new technologies and strong sales execution. We estimate that corn and soybeans delivered approximately $120 million in benefits from price improvement year-to-date. In September, we launched our 2021 sales season in North America. We expect to deliver another year of positive year-over-year price improvement in both corn and soybeans. As a result of our ability to price for value that these new seed technologies create for our customers. We anticipate our positioning in the marketplace will support our ability to continue to capture year-over-year value for superior performance, despite market competitiveness. We\u2019re also driving the Brevant retail brand launch in North America for the 2021 season and our discussions with retailers continue to be exceptionally positive, reinforced by the strong field trial performance of the Brevant product class in retailers test plots. We were also driving synergies and productivity, enabling us to offset the seed input costs and increase royalty cost headwinds we anticipated for the year. Turning to Slide 7. As part of our strategy update in August, we highlighted our expectations to create over $400 million in incremental operating EBITDA from the Enlist E3 soybeans system at peak. This estimate includes the benefits from eliminating trait royalty expense, scaling royalty income from out-licensing our technology and growing our share of the post emergent herbicide market. For 2020, we converted 17% of the Corteva soybean units in North America to the Enlist E3 platform. We believe that Enlist E3 offers growers a superior weed management system, and we are seeing exceptionally strong demand in the marketplace for the technology. As a result, our seed production teams collaborated closely with seed producers to ensure that we maximize supply for 2021. we are in the process of sampling and assessing quality on the harvested units and have growing confidence that we will be able to offer a high-quality Enlist E3 option in more Corteva units in 2021 that we indicated back in August. We now believe, we could have as much as 40% of our units in Enlist E3 next year. We are also actively staging Enlist herbicides in the retail channel in anticipation of seeing as much as 30% of the soybean units planted in North America in 2021, carrying the Enlist E3 trait. Clearly, this is our decade in soybeans. The ramp up of Enlist E3 represents the first time in almost three decades that growers have a scalable weed management alternatives. Over the course of the next few months, I look forward to providing additional updates on our momentum on this first-generation technology, as well as the next-generation pipeline that we are building. So, moving to the Crop Protection segment. Slide 8 provides a performance update and a summary of the key focus areas for driving margin expansion consistent with our midterm targets. For the segment, organic sales grew 21% in the quarter supported by a 16% improvement in volume and a 5% improvement in price. The strong third quarter performance in Latin America on continued technology adoption drove Crop Protection organic sales up 43% versus the prior year. The region overcame a 29% impact from currency. Year-to-date organic sales increased 7% supported by continued growth in new products and double-digit organic growth in Spinosyn insecticides, partially offset by our strategic decision to phase-out of Corteva PFOS by the end of this year and a ramp down of selected low margin third-party products. The overall Crop Protection result also reflects strong organic growth in Europe; Middle East and Africa, up 6%; Asia Pacific, up 12% and Latin America up 15% showing the balance and the diversity of our new products globally. New Crop Protection products are on track to deliver $250 million in organic sales growth for the full year. And despite the strong organic sales growth performance operating EBITDA for the segment has declined year-to-date, partially due to the impact of currency. Operating EBITDA has also been impacted by higher cost of goods sold in the segment. We have taken several actions starting back at the completion of the merger in 2017 to streamline our manufacturing organization to drive better operating leverage in Crop Protection. Now, as a reminder, it can take up to four years to complete a supply chain transition in Crop Protection in order to satisfy the regulatory requirements in every jurisdiction, in which our products are sold. So, this delays the time from when actions are taken to when the benefits are realized. as a result of the actions taken back in 2017, we will start to yield the benefits in 2021 and beyond. So, turning to slide 9 and taking a step back to review some of these actions. since closing the merger in 2017, we have worked aggressively to streamline the cost structure and improve the underlying productivity of our Crop Protection manufacturing organization. starting with our global manufacturing footprint and structure, we made targeted adjustments aligned to portfolio rationalizations and implemented a more efficient operating model resulting in a reduction of nine sites and approximately, 25% of the roles that were here at the time of the merger. At the same time, we moved swiftly to regionalize our formulation and packaging operations. Bringing these operations closer to end-use markets provides a double benefit of enabling us to operate closer to our customers, as well as providing a natural currency hedge for the future. And finally, we began the process of optimizing our active ingredient manufacturing, moving from a strong bias towards internal sources to a more balanced approach. In this approach, we continue to identify opportunities to reduce costs and build additional resiliency while preserving the value of our patent protected technology. Collectively, as a result of these efforts, we are on track to achieve the cost synergies and additional productivity that we have targeted. for the company, we\u2019ve talked about a total combined savings of $250 million in 2021 and our Crop Protection manufacturing actions represent about $150 million of that amount. Shifting the discussion to the outlook. I will provide some context on our future expectations on Slide 10. We continue to observe how key markets are recovering from the downturn, driven by the pandemic and are closely monitoring market conditions for next year including commodity demand levels, acreage levels and foreign currency exchange rates. We are seeing commodity demand stabilize in several key markets as well as very constructive actions from China regarding the pace and size of corn and soybean purchases from the U.S. on the commodity supply side, the directional event and droughts in parts of the U.S. this summer lowered harvestable area in yield and spurred increases in commodity price levels. improved commodity demand conditions and tightening stock levels are constructive indicators for overall commodity prices with corn and soybean prices now trading above pre-COVID levels. Higher prices are leading to an improved outlook for farm income. government stimulus payments in the U.S. are also supporting farm income improvement. So, given the impact of exchange rates on our business, we continue to closely monitor foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Brazilian Real and several European currencies. Taken together, the overall market backdrop, our strong operating momentum and expanded capability to address earnings volatility, support a very constructive view for a solid finish to 2020 and strong 2021 growth. So, I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Greg to provide more detail on our outlook. Greg? Greg Friedman : Thanks, Jim. turning to slide 11. We are affirming our full-year guidance for 2020, which reflects organic sales growth of 5% to 6% and operating EBITDA of $1.9 to $2.0 billion for the year. At the highest level, the organization is delivering on commitments despite the numerous headwinds we faced this year. Starting with currency, we continue to expect approximately $400 million in earnings headwinds for the full year, predominantly driven by the Brazilian real. We have realized $70 million in pricing through the third quarter to offset the weakening real and expect to recognize greater than $120 million in pricing for the full year. velocity and the ramp up of new Crop Protection products continue as we recognize $180 million in incremental organic sales through the first nine months. The organization remains on track to deliver on our full-year commitment of $250 million in organic sales growth led by products like Arylex and the Enlist herbicides and Isoclast insecticide. Fourth quarter is expected to be a solid quarter for North America Crop Protection as we positioned for strong early demand for the enlist system for the 2021 season. finally, on costs, we continue to see performance aligned with our expectations through the end of the third quarter. synergies and productivity savings are tracking according to plan with the expectations to deliver the full $230 million in savings by year-end. We are seeing further traction in our COVID-related spending reductions as we realized approximately $50 million in savings through the end of the quarter. As a final point on costs, we expect that we will end the year relatively flat in SG&A and R&D despite strategic investments, and increased commissions on higher sales. This update is a testament to the organization\u2019s focus on cost controls globally. Our operating EBITDA guidance reflects nearly $500 million of headwinds from the prior year due to currency and the one-time gains for asset divestitures in 2019. Despite these headwinds, the organization continues to focus on driving and delivering resiliency in our results has demonstrated by our strong execution in the third quarter. we have high confidence in maintaining this momentum in the fourth quarter and finishing the year strong. Turning to Slide 12. I\u2019ll provide our current views on the setup for 2021. starting with Seed, based on current relative prices of commodities, we anticipate corn acreage will likely be relatively flat in North America next year. for soybeans, we expect an increase for 2021 planted area. On seed pricing, we expect to drive our global strategy of pricing for value with continued benefit from penetration of the highest performing technologies like Qrome corn seed. We are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing in the marketplace for both our enlist soybeans system and the launch of Brevant in the U.S. retail channel. Turning to Crop Protection. We expect to maintain our growth in new product sales. This is growth is underpinned by strong market demand for enlist and Arylex herbicides and further penetration of Isoclast insecticide globally. With respect to our differentiated technologies, we expect to release incremental Spinosyn\u2019s capacity in 2021 to meet strong demand, and deliver price and volume growth. On currency, the organization has implemented comprehensive risk management approach to manage volatility. However, we still expect a headwind in the first half of 2021, given the significant swing in the Brazilian real compared to the first half of 2020. Pricing remains a strategic lever to offset this impact as our commercial teams in Brazil actively price for the changes in local currency. On pass, we will realize the final tranche of our merchant-related synergies delivering $200 million in savings for 2021. In addition, we expect to recognize approximately $50 million in incremental savings in 2021 related to our $500 million Execute to Win Productivity Program, mostly related to the manufacturing and supply chain rationalization work we have completed in Crop Protection. And finally, as it relates to cost of goods sold, we are still monitoring our 2020 harvest for seed that we will bag and sell in 2021. Depending on final yields and quality results, we could see a slight tailwind for seed input costs in 2021 as higher commodity prices partially offset expected favorable yields and productivity. To wrap up my comments about our current view on the 2021 backdrop, I\u2019ll provide some further perspective on our risk management strategy related to foreign currency. slide 13 shows how we have approach risk management of our global business footprint. We have a comprehensive program for managing foreign currency exposure, of which the Brazilian Real is the primary driver. As an underlying principle, we balanced economic costs with our approach to ensure an effective return to create better predictability and our forecast. for 2021, I would expect annual costs to be approximately $50 million in order to effectively hedge our income statement exposures to global currencies. Our primary means for mitigating FX exposure is by adjusting our local sales prices to offset depreciating currencies in geographies, where we\u2019re able to do so in the current and future periods. This is evident through the progress our commercial teams have made year-to-date. We expect to maintain this momentum in the fourth quarter with greater than $120 million in price improvements to offset currency for the full year. Additionally, we continue to evaluate opportunities to adjust our operational footprint to match the currency used in production with the revenues we generate to reduce exposure. as it relates to hedging, our strategic approach is to drive predictability in our forecast. As you recall, we sized currency as a $400 million operating EBITDA headwind for full year back in the second quarter and despite continued volatility in currency rates, we are maintaining this expectation. We will continue to provide updates on our execution. Turning now to slide 14. I\u2019ll provide a brief update on our capital allocation track record since spin and where we are focusing as we look forward. since spin, we have made targeted investments with more than $1 billion in capital deployed to-date to drive shareholder value. This includes our ERP harmonization efforts, optimizing a route-to-market expansion of our multibrand multichannel strategy and funding launch and ramp up of new and differentiated products globally, including the capital necessary to increase Spinosyn\u2019s capacity. These calculated high return investments were critical as we spun as a public company and with those investments well under way, we had the opportunity to shift our focus and accelerate our return to capital to shareholders. Specifically, we expect to build on the progress we have made against a $1 billion share repurchase program, and now expect to complete that commitment by the end of 2021, six months earlier than our original plan. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Jim. Jim Collins : Thanks, Greg. As we continue to execute on a strong finish to 2020, and look ahead to 2021, we remain both focused and flexible, focused on the path that we\u2019ve laid out, competently executing on our plans that we spoke about today. At the same time, we\u2019re prepared for any eventuality as we continue to navigate in a volatile external landscape. we\u2019ll stay flexible and we will monitor these dynamics. And importantly, we\u2019ll do that as we continue to deliver. we have the right strategy in place. Our balance sheet and liquidity position is solid and we have the right team and the right levers in place to deliver on this next stage of growth. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call back to Megan. Megan Britt : Thank you, Jim. Now let\u2019s move on to your questions. I\u2019d like to remind you that our cautions on forward-looking statements, non-GAAP measures and pro forma financials apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. operator, please provide the Q&A instruction. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning, everyone. If I could just ask on Enlist, if you could talk about specifically, in the Pioneer elite soy varieties, how many million acres you think you\u2019ll have for next year and if you could talk also about how your order book is trending, your Xtend acres versus your enlist acres, both before and after the recent Xtend registration? Thank you. Jim Collins : Yes. Great, Vincent. thanks for the question. As you\u2019ve heard in our opening comments, we\u2019re very excited about enlist and how that\u2019s going. We had talked about bean possibly 10% of our units in 2020 and we finished a year now closer to 17%. So, it was just because growers were really happy with the system and they got a lot of good experience with it. So back in August, we kind of guided that we thought we might be able to double that penetration in our units to closer to 35%. And I said back then that that was going to be really dependent upon one big variable and that was our ability to continue to acquire high-quality seed from seed producers in this season and have it ready to go for 2021. Well I got to tell you, our teams had done a fantastic job. And so what we talked about earlier is we\u2019re going to push that number now up to maybe, closer to 40% of our units in 2021. And that\u2019s back to two things first, it\u2019s the early response to our order book and just how excited growers are to want to continue to get into the system and second our ability to supply. With regard to germplasm, we really don\u2019t think about it as pioneer germplasm. It\u2019s really Corteva germplasm, and we\u2019ve got the best germplasm in the industry and we\u2019re deploying that across our entire portfolio. We\u2019re going to continue to drive that conversion hard, in 2020, about 10% of our germplasm was converted and we\u2019ll get that closer to 20% to 25% in 2021 is about where we sit. Tim, you\u2019ve been talking to growers recently listening to our sales team. What else would you say about our order book and how things have gone early on in the season? Tim Glenn : Yes, Jim. I think you hit on many of the key points. When I look at where we\u2019re at in the season, obviously, we had tremendous uptake this past spring, and as we went through the growing season, farmers had tremendous experience with the herbicide system, really reinforced the value there and as we went through harvest, I\u2019d say our product performance really met your expectations. So, we\u2019re in a good spot there, and as we sit here today, first week of November, feel very good about where order sit overall, and certainly as it relates to enlist and Jim indicated the strong demand there, and we continue to \u2013 we continue to feel good about that mix and physically, see some upside there. but I would also enforce \u2013 reinforce that our Xtend orders are about where we would expect them to be as well. And so we continue to have the \u2013 I think this year\u2019s data supports significant supply of Xtend, but also the strongest performing Xtend varieties in the marketplace with our A Series products. And so there\u2019s clearly a place for the technology and we\u2019re working for our customers, who want Xtend, and as we saw the registration come through, it wasn\u2019t a surprise. I mean, we expected there to be news and as did our customers, and I would say really, it doesn\u2019t have an impact in terms of the mix that we\u2019ll sell. The customers who are interested in Enlist and are ordering Enlist right now are committed to enlist. And I think the customers, who want our A series beans also want that, and obviously, the availability of Dicamba as it sorts out going forward is going to be a value to them, should they choose to use that the Xtend system as well. So, we feel good about where we\u2019re sitting and obviously, excited about our overall portfolio, very excited about where our orders sit on this date and able to bring good solutions to our customers. Vincent Andrews : Great. Jim Collins : Thanks, Vincent. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go to Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Joel Jackson : Hi, good morning. Jim Collins : Good morning, Joel. Joel Jackson : Jim, when I look at your \u2013 you expect $250 million of better earning next year from continue merger synergies and productivity gains, when we add all the other building blocks to talk about, be it seed price mix with higher soybean acres, Spinosyn growth, maintaining COVID cost savings, new products, Isoclast, et cetera, other things going on it would seem that all those building blocks suggest that \u2013 you\u2019ve got some currency offsets, but including that, it would seem that you have enough building blocks here that that should all be additive to $250 million of earnings growth for synergy and productivity gain [indiscernible]. Can you speak to that please? Jim Collins : Yes. Joel, good morning. As we sit here today, thinking about 2021, I think, you\u2019ve hit on a couple of important points. The first thing for us is the market conditions. I\u2019d say there are some external factors that are shaping up to be maybe, even a slight tailwind, commodity demand, what\u2019s happening with trade and farmer economics is creating a market environment that I would say, we don\u2019t really agree with how others have characterized that market environment going forward. So, we set the external piece over there to the side and say, we could be heading into an improving marketplace. Now, there are clearly some things that we\u2019re watching on the other side of that COVID-related demand issues and currency will always be out there. So, then we go to the focus on the levers that are within our control, and you\u2019ve hit on a few of those. We\u2019ve just talked about enlist. We\u2019re going to keep driving Enlist. There\u2019s margin opportunity there on the seed, but also on the opportunity with the herbicide, 70% of those acres out there are going to get sprayed with 2,4-D and we\u2019re positioning ourselves to be ready to go capture that. we\u2019ve talked about Brevant in our retail penetration. We could see a 25% improvement in the number of units that we sell through that retail channel, going into 2021. And then you mentioned pricing. And so we\u2019ve got a track record here now demonstrating our pricing momentum. This will be the third year that we\u2019ve been able to drive low single-digit improvements year-over-year, based on the value that we price for the superior genetics that we have out there in the marketplace. And then a couple of final things, you\u2019ve mentioned our new Crop Protection products in the past, those are delivering, you really saw those show up now year-to-date in 2020 with growth in places like Europe and Asia Pacific, that momentum will continue. And then finally, you mentioned productivity. And so we have all those productivity programs in place. The 200 of additional synergy flow through, the additional 50 of productivity that\u2019ll come from our Execute to Win work. So, I think we\u2019re really well positioned and I would summarize it by one word, and that\u2019s just momentum. We\u2019re carrying momentum as we come off of 2020 into 2021. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go to Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Jim Collins : Good morning, Arun. Operator : Go ahead, Arun. your line is open, sir. Maybe unmute. Jim Collins : Some technical difficulties here. Operator : Okay. Hearing no response, we\u2019re going to move to the next question. We\u2019ll go next to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Jim, you have a new shareholder, who has made some public observations about your business, specifically about your markets versus your peers. Do you agree with those observations and if not, where are they missing the mark there? Thank you. Jim Collins : Good morning, David. Yes. Thanks for the question. Clearly, we have opportunities from a margin perspective related to our productivity work, and we\u2019ve talked about that and we\u2019re driving those, we\u2019ve got the over \u2013 the $500 million of overall productivity we\u2019ve committed to over the next five years related to our Execute to Win. You\u2019ve got the ERP productivity that will flow through and some remaining synergies that will flow through next year. We\u2019d kind of complete that synergy work. So, there\u2019s quite a good piece right there that is just pure productivity that will help improve margin. And then you add the momentum of the other areas that we\u2019re driving around growth. So, you\u2019ve got enlist. We talked about the $400 million of margin expansion due to the whole system, the royalty trait reduction from Xtend, the opportunity to sell more enlist herbicide and the royalty income coming in from the licensing of that trait. And then I mentioned, Brevant and our new Crop Protection portfolio that\u2019ll continue to deliver over the timeframe. So look, we agree that there\u2019s tremendous EBITDA margin potential improvement in this business. I\u2019ve been talking about that since the day we merged and continue to be very excited about that and we can see all of the pieces. I don\u2019t have to go out and invent that future. It\u2019s sitting here right now, what we have to do is execute it. So probably, the only question in that whole discussion is our view of the timing of that improvement. So, we\u2019ve got our strategy. I\u2019ve got a great team here, that\u2019s focused on it. We\u2019re just going to stay focused on the execution of that. Thanks, David. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go to P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Kendall Marthaler : Thanks. This is actually Kendall Marthaler on for P.J. So, just wanted to ask question about seeds, obviously a lot of the negative impact this quarter was due to timing shifts in North America, but curious if you could talk a little bit more about maybe, market share gain or loss for Corteva during the quarter. And then also with the expectations for higher prices in seed next year, we talked about that being due to driving value. But have you seen a little extra support either from easing competitive pressures or has the improvement in farmer economics recently helped support that price increase as well? Jim Collins : Great. Thanks for the question. So, first part of your question, clearly this \u2013 the seed year-to-date numbers are the important metric to look at not just third quarter, the timing issues were related to those weather events that we saw in 2019 that drove the season late in North America. We still shipped a couple of million units of seed into the third quarter of getting that last a little bit of soybean market planted last year. So, this season has been perfect in terms of its timing. It broke early and we got a bulk of our North America business in the second quarter, where it traditionally belongs. So, that explains third quarter, look at it on a year-to-date basis. When we look overall at market share, I\u2019d say on superior genetics in soybeans, we\u2019ve probably had a modest market share gain there on the current acreage. And that A series performance, the yield advantage over its competition allows us to drive a nice pricing approach, and I would call probably corn about flat. We drove strong price increases, so we didn\u2019t step backwards any in that market from a market share perspective, but we generate a lot of value on top of those same acres. But with a better pricing profile, maybe, I\u2019ll throw it over to Tim; any other market share areas around the world that you would highlight for him? Tim Glenn : Yes. I think probably, a couple other large markets we have. I think in Europe at this point in time, we can be fairly confident that we gained share for both corn and sunflower with price increases as well. So, those are the two primary crops in a significant business in Europe. And I would say, we\u2019re just working through the spring seasons in Latin America, but the Argentina and Brazil. And I think we feel good about what our finds our progress or for gaining share in those spring seasons. And obviously, in Brazil, we\u2019re wrapping up and focused on the spring season. and so we\u2019re well advanced in terms of collecting orders and feel good about where we sit there as well. So overall, I think a solid market share here for corn and other crops around the world. Jim Collins : And your final \u2013 final part of your question was around pricing on a go-forward basis. So, our strategy continues to be unchanged. We\u2019re going to price for the value that we deliver, because of the year-over-year improvements in our technology. I mentioned, we\u2019ve got a track record of doing that. Qrome is a big element of that going forward. If it helps price in 2021, we\u2019re going to go from about 20% to 25% of our line-up in Qrome next year. And so you\u2019ll have a nice mix for that. And then as I mentioned in soybeans, just the A Series profile that we have in our ability to deliver more value for growers on a yield and a per acre basis. Thank you. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to John Roberts with UBS. Matt Skowronski : Good morning. This is Matt Skowronski on for John. With regards to enlist, you expect Enlist E3 soybeans year on 40% of Corteva\u2019s total soybean portfolio in 2021 from 17% in 2020. How are you thinking about the progression of Enlist E3 soybean as a percent of Corteva\u2019s total soybean portfolio in 2022; in other words, how do you expect it to step up? Jim Collins : Yes, great question. Timing is always a little bit connected to Mother Nature and adoption rates there, but we\u2019re going to continue to push it hard. We\u2019d expect to be able to drive that north of 90% of our units by kind of mid-decade. And so we\u2019ll \u2013 you\u2019ll kind of draw a line between, where we\u2019ll end in 2021 and say that that 2024, 2025. We may still have some Xtend units in our line-up. There may be growers out there that prefer that system. And I think that\u2019s the beauty of Corteva. The fact that we have the opportunity to offer a number of choices for our growers to support them in the way that they want to farm either Tim or Rajan, anything else you\u2019d add to that? Tim Glenn : Yes. The only thing I\u2019d add is clearly, the customer is going to have to say in this and we\u2019re working closely with our customers. And I would say that the growth we\u2019ve seen this year, literally, we\u2019re out there supporting it and promoting in the marketplace, but it\u2019s been customer driven demand. That\u2019s really helped drive this rapid adoption in the marketplace and I think we\u2019ll see that again in 2022, and obviously, we\u2019ll be collaborating closely with our customers and getting their signals as we put together a portfolio for 2022. but clearly, the customer is at the heart of it and they\u2019re getting great value here. Jim Collins : All right. Thanks. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning. Appreciate the color on foreign exchange on slide 13 as well as the remarks. Greg, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on, what portion of foreign exchange you would typically expect to recover via selling prices versus a portion that would be hedged? It sounds like the approach there is meant to be pretty consistent. And then secondly, as a clarification, I think you mentioned a $50 million number for 2021 and I just wanted to clarify if that\u2019s the expected cost of the program or the expected earnings headwind? Greg Friedman : Thanks Kevin, for the question. I\u2019ll start with your second part first, which is the $50 million that we talked about. That\u2019s expected to be the cost of the program. So that\u2019s the headwind in that regard. You asked about what portion of our foreign related earnings we\u2019re hedging. And when we look at \u2013 we look at that by exposure, and our largest exposures, 80% of our exposures are really in just a few currencies. And we hedge three currencies, the largest of which is a Brazilian Real. So, that\u2019s really, the focus of our program is on those three larger elements and as we talked about the balance on the return with the constant hedging to optimize that exposure. But as you can imagine, we\u2019ll never be able to reduce that exposure entirely. So, we hedge to really reduce volatility to a manageable level, so that we can have confidence in our forecast. And additionally, one of the concepts, one of our strategies here is that we\u2019re consistent on how we apply the strategy throughout the year and we do that without market speculation. And on the cost of $50 million, it\u2019s not all incremental, it\u2019s actually total cost. Jim Collins : Now, Kevin, one other thing I\u2019d add, you asked about just maybe, our overall philosophy around hedging, that are around managing currency risks. That really first starts with pricing as you mentioned. So, our goal is to cover as much of that currency effect if you will, as you can through pricing, but we sort of, currency moves on us and then we go take the next available opportunity that we have to reset prices. So, it usually takes us a couple of ag seasons, maybe a year and a half or so to fully offset a 100% of that. But in any one year, you\u2019ll see us work to offset as much of that as we can, but things this year went so rapidly, we were really chasing ourselves. So, we\u2019ll still see a little bit of currency impact in the first quarter of 2021, as we kind of catch the tail of what happened to us due to the COVID run-up in that March, April timeframe. but our teams are locked and loaded; they\u2019re very focused on trying to recover as much as they can as we come back around that second season. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Hey, good morning, folks. Greg, I appreciated the commentary about forecasting FX as a $400 million headwind for 2020 back in the second quarter. So, things are playing out that way. So I guess, you also, at that point, forecast your EBITDA for the year and you\u2019re maintaining your forecast for the year. It\u2019s a $100 million range. We only have one more quarter left to go. So, I was just curious, was there any thought to narrowing that range and what needs to happen for hit the low end, the high end, any more color around that guidance be helpful. Greg Friedman : Great. Thanks, Frank. As we finish up the year, there\u2019s the last month of the year in the last month of the quarter tends to be the most important and actually, the most potentially volatile all a month. So, we\u2019re really depending on our shipments that we\u2019re making, we\u2019re also depending on the cash that we\u2019re collecting in that last month of the year. So yes, there is some better predictability through November, but it really is that that last month of the year that can provide that volatility, and given our guidance and the range that we\u2019ve provided, we feel confident and that\u2019s why we\u2019re able to affirm our guidance. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Chris Parkinson of Credit Suisse. Chris Parkinson : Great. Thank you very much. You\u2019ve posted some pretty solid performance across your CPC portfolio. I think, particularly pleasantly surprised in APAC and EMEA, just given investors focus on your long-term CPC growth algo, can you just further comment on the one to two initiatives in each geography, which you believe advantageously positions adequate to have a platform versus its peers, just I\u2019d love to hear your thought processes and just where you\u2019re most enthusiastic? Thank you. Jim Collins : Yes. Great, Chris. Maybe, I\u2019ll ask Tim Glenn to give us a little tour of a couple of the regions and talk about a few of those things. I do want to reinforce two messages. First, I agree with you. Our teams in Europe and Asia Pacific, especially in our Crop Protection portfolio are performing extremely well in our insecticide business. Thanks to the capacity expansions we put in place with the Spinosyn really delivering, and our European team really driving some strong growth in herbicides and Tim will share some more of the specifics. But I also want to make sure it doesn\u2019t get left out of this discussion, what our Latin America team did in Crop Protection. I think there were some concerns at the end of second quarter that there was something up in our Latin America CP business. And I remember saying to everyone, it was purely timing. Some of that we did ourselves and some of that was just the way the market was unfolding more normally. Well, you see what happened. We had 43% price volume growth in Latin America in 3Q and that\u2019s that volume effect of that business landing kind of where it belongs. So with that, Tim, you want to talk a little bit more about specifics in Europe and Asia? Tim Glenn : Yes, Jim. Thanks, Chris. Great question and I appreciate the call for especially, for the Europe and Asia Pacific teams. I\u2019m excited about opportunities we have everywhere. So, but really to focus on those two regions here for a moment, I think at the heart of it is the fact that we\u2019ve got a strong focus around commercial effectiveness. And when I talk about commercial effectiveness, it\u2019s about being able to serve customers, the way that they want to be served fundamentally, strengthening our route to market in terms of how we go to serve customers. We talked about that a lot on the Seed, but not necessarily always on Crop Protection. Our ability to go out and demonstrate capture value in the marketplace and clearly, given the pipeline of products, we\u2019ve had our ability to be a strong launch machine and capture full value there. I mean, that\u2019s kind of at the heart of what we\u2019re trying to do with our commercial effectiveness process. Examples in Europe, I\u2019ll highlight here. We\u2019ve had a tremendous focus since we came together as Corteva, but we knew we had maybe, a weakness in terms of our presence in Central and Eastern Europe on the Crop Protection side. And so we really build out some capabilities there to be able to serve the market in general, but also, in particular with some of the large farming enterprise as we see in Eastern Europe and we\u2019re seeing tremendous benefits of the focus on routes to market as we look at the performance of our Arylex and Rinskor products in Europe. In Asia Pacific, we got a really strong fundamental business there, but we\u2019re constantly focused on our demand creation capabilities with small holder farms, very critical in Europe. And again, we talked a lot about in Seed and we spent time, talking about how we reached farmers in NDF, through a provocative model on Seed, but we also have to be able to go out there and demonstrate the value, because you don\u2019t have as sophisticated a distribution channel to reach all those small farmers out there and our team in Asia does that tremendously well, and I think our ongoing growth in our Spinosyn business is a great testament to that. And when you look at new product launches, like Pyraxalt and how we\u2019ve been able to ramp that up and capture great value. I mean I think those are two great examples within the region, but I really appreciate you calling out those other regions, because we don\u2019t always get as much visibility or airtime, but both regions have had fantastic years in both Seed and Crop Protection, but especially, in Crop Protection. Jim Collins : Yes. I would second that and look at those on a year-to-date basis as well. We\u2019re talking about a lot of really good things in 3Q, but they\u2019ve been doing this all year long. So, thanks Chris for the question. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Jonas Oxgaard : Good morning. Jim Collins : Good morning, Jonas. Jonas Oxgaard : I wanted to ask about Chinese active ingredient pricing. If I remember correctly last year, you were talking about something like a $100 million headwind, because of increased Chinese pricing. Those have largely come down. So, are we expecting a tailwind from that coming down or has that already trickled through to earnings? Jim Collins : Yes. thanks, Jonas for the question. I\u2019ll \u2013 all of our supply chain and manufacturing organization assist with Rajan. So, I\u2019ll ask him maybe, to make a few comments, but I would say you\u2019re correct in that we previously faced some headwinds. Those have by and large kind of stabilized, as we\u2019ve managed either to adjust our supply chains appropriately or these new relocations of a lot of the \u2013 some of the Chinese suppliers that we worked with, they\u2019re stabilized now and they\u2019ve set themselves up and they\u2019re getting their cost structures back. But Rajan, what else would you add? Rajan Gajaria : No, I think you covered it, Jim. But Jonas, it is a less volatility related to active ingredient pricing coming out of China. So, we see a lot more stability and some of that volatility was driven just from supply chain disruptions related to COVID early in the year. Now, there are some specific areas like precious metals, which are used for catalyst in areas, where we do see price increases continuing to go up. They are a key part of our manufacturing processes, especially for our patent products there. So, there are some specific areas, where we do expect some headwinds continued in and we are factoring that into our 2021 plan. But overall, let\u2019s try to say that there is a less volatility then we had in the beginning of the year and we have got more visibility and stability of process supply chains for those costs. Jonas Oxgaard : Great. Thanks, Rajan. Rajan Gajaria : Thanks, Jonas. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to a Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks. Jim Collins : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi, good morning. Are the yields very different on Enlist soybeans and Xtend soybeans, and are the prices of Xtend and Enlist soybeans very different, as best as you can tell? Jim Collins : Tim, you want to\u2026 Tim Glenn : Yes. I think you have to look, I\u2019ll speak to what we\u2019re seeing and we are \u2013 both our Xtend and Enlist products are performing very well this year. And I think meeting customer\u2019s expectations on yield, and I will tell you, I think our Enlist varieties will compete with any competitive Xtend product in the marketplace. And so we\u2019re very confident about that and very proud of the performance across our entire portfolio and I think it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s going to be reinforced by our order position and where we sit in the marketplace. And from a pricing standpoint, it\u2019s hard to describe the market in pricing terms, but what we see is premium price products for both Xtend and Enlist are kind of in the same zone maybe, not on absolute dollars, but from our standpoint, our leading products are priced similarly. And I think in the marketplace, we are in a competitive marketplace and there\u2019s a lot of options out for farmers, but what we see in the marketplace is that that both Enlist and Xtend are able to support good value in the marketplace. Jim Collins : Yes, Jeff. I\u2019ve heard Tim make this statement before. So, I\u2019ll reiterate it. There is no doubt that our A series line-up in Xtend soybeans is the top performer in the marketplace, but our Enlist beans don\u2019t have to compete with us. Our Enlist beans only have to go out there and compete with other Xtend beans. And as Tim said, since we\u2019re not competing with ourselves, our Enlist line-up lines up very favorably against others\u2019 Xtend beans in the marketplace. So, we feel really good about from a yield perspective in the competitive frame, that\u2019s out there. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go to Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in. So, a couple of questions just around the Seed outlook for next year, and I\u2019m trying to think about margin implications, if any of Brevant kind of expanding and launching nationally with retail. Any margin implications in Seed of the incremental Enlist penetration in your line-up relative to where you were, I know for now you don\u2019t have full control over the germplasm. So, just help us think about kind of the margin implications with it there. And then any update on yield on the corn portfolio this year, and just the ability to price for value into next year. Thanks. Jim Collins : Thanks. On Brevant, we are in total control of the germplasm associated with our Brevant launch. It\u2019s Enlist and as we convert over a lot of our germplasm over to the Enlist system, but we\u2019re mostly launching that through several of the other channels that we have out there. So, Brevant is being launched at a different price point, because it represents a different price for value and the germplasm that it delivers and we\u2019re going to grow our units in retail by about 25% this year at a good margin for our business is what I would say. Tim, anything else you would add or Rajan on any other thoughts there? Rajan Gajaria : No. You\u2019ve covered it well, Jim. Jim Collins : Okay, great. Thanks for that question. Operator : Go ahead, Ms. Britt. Megan Britt : Okay. So that\u2019s actually all the time and effort for questions today. we really appreciate your interest in Corteva. Thank you so much for joining us. Operator : And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Collins : Thank you Jeff, and welcome to the participants joining the call today. Starting on Slide 4, as I reflect on the year, 2020 was a year of profound societal and economic disruptions globally. Despite these challenges, I\u2019m extremely proud of the continued resiliency of our company. Our global teams have worked aggressively to keep our employees and customers safe, our supply chains open, and our growth commitments on track. Our progress as a company in managing through the pandemic and other disruptions over the last year confirms the strength and durability of our strategy.  Underpinning our progress is our strong organic sales growth for the full year, where our teams delivered gains in both seed and crop protection and across all regions. Transforming our cost structure remains a priority for Corteva to deliver on our targeted earnings growth. We\u2019ve demonstrated our commitment to cost reductions in 2020 by managing spending and delivering on our productivity programs. These savings were mostly offset from headwinds that we had anticipated, such a higher input costs and investments to support growth in addition to unfavorable currency. Despite these hurdles, we delivered solid operating EBITDA improvement for the year.  Turning to the balance sheet, we continued to strengthen our financial position as we ended the year with cash and investments of roughly $3.8 billion. Further, our cash net of debt improved by approximately a billion dollars over the prior year as a result of the organization\u2019s focus on disciplined capital deployment and strong execution on working capital productivity. The company made progress on returning cash to shareholders with more than $660 million returned via dividends and share repurchases. Looking ahead, we see 2021 as a year in which we will accelerate on our path and expect to capitalize on the significant momentum we have built as the investments we made since 2017 begin to drive substantial earnings improvement. Our entire team is focused on executing to deliver further value for our shareholders from a number of in-flight strategic initiatives, including the ramp-up of Enlist, the launch of Brevant in the U.S. retail channel, and the continued advancement of our crop protection pipeline following 2020, where we obtained more than 140 registrations globally for new active ingredients and formulations that we will start selling in 2021. We recognize that our 2020 performance was not where we need to be in terms of realizing the full operating leverage from organic growth and productivity programs in our earnings. For 2021, I am confident that we have made the necessary adjustments and are well positioned to deliver 15% to 20% operating EBITDA improvement for the year, including more than 200 basis points of margin improvement as the organization remains focused on executing on our targeted productivity actions. On capital allocation, you may recall that we discussed last quarter that we planned to accelerate the completion of our $1 billion share repurchase program by the end of 2021, which was six months ahead of our initial plan. Given our current cash position and outlook for 2021, we expect to complete most of the repurchases by midyear while maintaining our strong balance sheet and investing for growth. The bottom line, we view 2021 as a big step forward for Corteva, and I am confident we remain on track and laser focused on delivering on our midterm targets.  Turning next to Slide 5 and briefly touching on 2020 performance for the total company, for sales, strong organic growth in both segments and across all regions led to improved performance compared to our revised guidance with double digit organic growth for the year in both Latin America and Asia-Pacific. Continued penetration of new and differentiated technology drove the increases, including 2% pricing in our corn and soybean portfolios globally. On operating EBITDA, we delivered 5% improvement for the year, exceeding our expectations compared to our revised guidance as organic growth and cost and productivity actions were partially offset by higher input costs and an unfavorable net currency impact. On currency net of pricing, results were better than we had anticipated for the year as teams delivered strong execution on local pricing coupled with favorable movements in exchange rates late in the fourth quarter. As a result, despite a 15 basis point decline in the fourth quarter on the absence of prior year divestitures, we extracted 33 basis points of margin expansion for the year, establishing a strong foundation for solid growth moving forward. Shifting the discussion to the market backdrop on Slide 6, while more resilient than some other sectors, the ag markets faced unexpected impacts resulting from the COVID-related disruptions. Throughout the year, we observed tremendous volatility including commodity demand levels, acreage levels, and foreign currency exchange rates. As our business is highly sensitive to these movements, we have closely and continuously monitored market conditions and remain agile to adjust our actions accordingly. As we entered the fourth quarter, fundamentals shifted and the outlook began to improve. Commodity demand has stabilized considerably with constructive trends out of China on grain purchases from the U.S. This trend coupled with lower yields for 2020 U.S. crops and uncertainty in Brazil has led to higher commodity prices, which also leads to improved outlook on farm income levels, resulting in the highest levels we\u2019ve seen in seven years. Government stimulus payments in the U.S. are also supporting farm income improvement. After two straight years of unprecedented impacts from weather and the pandemic, we are pleased to see signs of a more favorable market environment for 2021.  Taking our operational momentum into consideration, we are encouraged as strengthening ag fundamentals add additional support to our expectations to further accelerate our strategy and deliver strong growth in 2021.  Now moving to Slide 7 for full-year highlights on the top line performance from our teams around the globe. In North America, we delivered organic sales growth of 4% for the year powered by high performing technologies like Qrome corn seed, which provides growers an approximately eight to 10 bushel per acre yield advantage over comparable products. In soybeans as the recovery in planted acres helped volumes, we drove 2% pricing with a yield advantaged line-up and disciplined execution by our teams.  We also continued to make progress in accelerating the ramp-up of our Enlist system. While we entered 2020 expecting Enlist E3 soybeans to represent just 10% of our soybean volume, we finished the year well ahead of those expectations at approximately 17% of our volume and on 20% of total U.S. soybean acres. That has helped drive strong early demand for Enlist herbicides which delivered $140 million in fourth quarter sales, more than double the prior year period. The full Enlist system delivered approximately $440 million in sales for the year, and we could not be more excited about how the system is gaining traction in the market.  In Europe, Middle East and Africa, organic sales grew 8% in 2020 on strong demand for new and differentiated crop protection products such as Arylex and Rinskor herbicides. Arylex is a product we are particularly excited about as it progressed through the European regulatory process faster than any product I can remember in recent years and really exemplifies our advantages in sustainable chemistry solutions, an area of growing demand where we have highly effective products in the market and in our pipeline. In seed, we were able to drive volume and price gains as a result of our route to market expansions in Russia and Ukraine, as well as share gains in corn. While significant currency volatility from the Brazilian real weighed on net sales in Latin America, we delivered 17% organic growth for the year. Here, we executed on market share gains in both seed and crop protection and gained meaningful market share in the Brazil Safrinha market while we continued to drive adoption of our novel crop protection products. The teams displayed strong execution by managing the volatility of local currency, which is evident in the $150 million in pricing for currency in Brazil for the year. In Asia-Pacific, we realized 13% organic sales growth compared to prior year on both volume and price improvements. This progress is another proof point of continued penetration of our new technology as we drove the adoption of Rinskor and Arylex herbicides as well as other advantaged products, like the spinosyn insecticide. During the period, we also benefited from strong demand for seeds in India. Moving to Slide 8 for a more detailed review of our 2020 operating EBITDA performance, we delivered strong price mix benefits of $210 million and volume benefits of $160 million from the continued penetration of our new and differentiated technology across all regions, representing important progress on our targets. Through these actions, we delivered $100 million in earnings improvement on the sales growth of $250 million of new crop protection products in 2020.  At the same time, we drove seed share gains in Europe and Latin America. Seed pricing improved operating EBITDA for the year led by a 2% improvement globally for corn and 2% improvement for soybeans in North America. On cost, we delivered approximately $30 million in net operating EBITDA improvement for the year. This improvement reflects execution on the $230 million in productivity and cost actions which were largely offset by higher input costs and reinvestments to accelerate future growth and profitability.  Other was a headwind for 2020 that predominantly reflects the impact of asset divestitures in 2019.  Lastly, gross currency impact to operating EBITDA was approximately $330 million before pricing and was predominantly due to the devaluation of the Brazilian real. To offset this headwind, local teams delivered approximately $150 million in pricing for currency, resulting in a net currency headwind of approximately $180 million for the year. Our growth initiatives are taking hold and we continue to take action to reduce costs and drive productivity across the organization. Yesterday we announced a restructuring program that includes facilities consolidations, footprint efficiencies, and headcount reductions. This is part of delivering on our broader productivity programs. We are confident that we have reached the point where the investments we have made over the past few years will begin to accelerate earnings growth in 2021 and beyond. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg to provide more detail on our results and the 2021 outlook. Greg Friedman : Thanks Jim.  Moving to Slide 9 and a more in-depth look at our performance in the crop protection segment, organic sales for the fourth quarter grew 21% driven by an 11% improvement in volume and a 10% improvement in price. Robust demand for Enlist herbicides coupled with fall applications of optunite [ph] in North America drove organic sales up 31% over prior year. Strong demand for our new products and pricing actions to offset currency also led to organic growth of 21% in Latin America and 17% in Asia-Pacific for the quarter. Coupled with our productivity actions, this growth drove an approximate 70 basis point operating EBITDA margin benefit for the segment in the quarter, despite the net impact of asset divestitures in 2019. For the full year, organic sales increased 11% supported by continued growth in new products and in our differentiated spinosyn insecticides, both up double digits on an organic basis over prior year. This growth was partially offset by our strategic decision to phase out chlorpyrifos and ramp down of selected low margin third party products.  Overall, crop protection results reflect price and volume gains in all regions, showing the balance and diversity of our new and differentiated products globally as well as our ability to grow organically above the market. Despite this organic sales growth, operating EBITDA for the segment has declined for the year due to the impact of currency coupled with higher input costs, investments to support growth, and the impact of asset divestitures in 2019.  On costs, as we mentioned last quarter, we have taken several actions starting back at the completion of the merger in 2017 to streamline our manufacturing operations to drive better operating leverage in crop protection. Given the regulatory approval requirements in each of the jurisdictions where we sell our products, it takes several years for the benefit of our asset footprint actions to impact the bottom line. We should begin to see those benefits in 2021. On currency, we have recognized approximately $150 million in pricing for the year to offset the weakening Brazilian real, and pricing will continue to be a strategic lever for us going forward.  Moving to the seed segment on Slide 10, organic sales for the fourth quarter were up 9%, driven by strong Safrinha corn sales in Brazil and deliveries in North America and Europe on an early start to the season. Operating EBITDA for the segment declined for the quarter due to the impact of currency and higher commodity costs. Full year organic sales grew 6% due to the soybean acreage rebound and improved price in North America, market share gains in Brazil and Europe corn, and strong volume and price gains on new products, particularly Qrome, Powercore Ultra, and Enlist E3 soybeans. Overall, price and volume gains coupled with productivity actions drove an approximate 190 basis point operating EBITDA margin benefit for the segment for the year. Turning now to Slide 11, I\u2019ll provide our full year guidance for 2021.  Starting with net sales, we expect reported net sales to be between $14.4 billion and $14.6 billion, up roughly 2% over prior year at the midpoint of the range, with organic growth of about 3%. This primarily reflects the continued ramp of new products globally in both our crop protection and seed segments, partially offset by the strategic decisions we\u2019ve made in our crop protection portfolio to further drive margin improvement. On operating EBITDA, we expect to deliver between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, an improvement of 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. With our expected top line growth and continued focus on delivering cost savings commitments, we expect to improve operating EBITDA margins by over 200 basis points on a total company basis. Turning to operating EPS, we expect to deliver between $1.85 and $1.95 per share, which would represent a 27% improvement over 2020 using the midpoint. We have provided supplemental information on our guidance in the appendix of our presentation. Focusing on operating EBITDA, Slide 12 provides our key assumptions. Starting with seed, global demand for agricultural products continues to be strong. If new crop prices sustain at current levels and weather remains favorable for a normal spring planting pace, we anticipate combined U.S. 2021 corn and soybean area will increase between 5 million and 8 million acres. Based on relative commodities prices, we expect that the planted area increase will be heavily biased towards soybeans. We will refine our assumptions when the market data is available as part of the March prospective planting estimates published by the USDA. In terms of Enlist expectations, consistent with what we shared on our third quarter call, we believe we could have greater than 35% of our units in Enlist E3 next year and anticipate as much as 30% of the soybean units in North America will carry the Enlist E3 trait. On seed pricing, we expect to maintain our 2020 momentum and continue to extract value per yield advantaged technology in corn globally, including further penetration of Qrome in our corn line-up.  Turning to crop protection, we expect to deliver continued growth in our new product sales. This growth is underpinned by strong market demand for Enlist and Arylex herbicides and continued penetration of [indiscernible] class insecticide globally. In total, we expect new crop protection products to contribute approximately $300 million in incremental sales growth during 2021. With respect to our differentiated technologies, we expect to release an additional 10% of spinosyns capacity in 2021, resulting in approximately $80 million of additional sales opportunity as demand will continue to exceed supply for this product in a growing targeted segment of the market.  As I\u2019ve mentioned, we have made strategic decisions to phase out chlorpyrifos and ramp down selected low margin third party products. While these changes are accretive to our margins, we do expect an approximate $75 million headwind to earnings in 2021 as a result of these decisions, which is included in our volume assumptions. Moving onto costs, we are targeting approximately $150 million in net cost savings in 2021, which includes $250 million in savings from our productivity programs mostly related to the manufacturing and supply chain rationalization work we have underway in crop protection. We also expect the majority of our COVID-related savings in 2020 will be sustained in 2021. These savings will be partially offset by an approximate $100 million headwind in seed input costs as a result of higher grower compensation costs due to rising commodity prices, along with unfavorable yields in Europe. Finally on currency, we expect a headwind in 2021 given the change in the year-over-year rates for the Brazilian real and seasonality. Pricing will continue to be a lever to offset this impact as our commercial teams in Brazil actively price for changes in local currency. We anticipate we will recognize approximately $100 million in pricing for the year, reflecting a rate of approximately 550. Through our dynamic pricing coupled with the financial instruments we have in place, we expect to further reduce volatility in our guidance and will continually monitor movement in local currency rates, as that could more directly impact our ability to price for currency. Turning now to Slide 13, I\u2019ll provide an update on our capital deployment targets over the midterm. As a result of our strong operational performance throughout 2020 coupled with effective working capital management, we ended the year with approximately $3.8 billion in cash and investments - that\u2019s after returning more than $660 million to shareholders this year through dividends and share repurchases. Building on this momentum, we expect to generate between $3 billion and $3.5 billion of operating cash flow in total for 2021 and 2022 combined, largely driven by earnings growth and continued focus on working capital productivity. Taking a look at the potential uses for cash, we have outlined several key priorities. Our first priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet with the financial flexibility to support our industry-leading business model, which will allow us to fund investments in the business annually. These investments will reinforce and renew our innovation and market capabilities. We will also continue to explore paths to optimize our portfolio through opportunistic bolt-on M&A, including fruit and vegetable seeds, digital technology, and biologicals. Finally, we are committed to accelerating the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In short, we see tremendous opportunity to return capital to our shareholders over the midterm. As you can see, we view the cash generation capabilities of this business as very strong and we are excited to share more details as we move forward in our journey. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Jim. Jim Collins : Thanks Greg. Turning to Slide 14, I would like to emphasize a few key points before we take your questions. We\u2019ve made tremendous progress in the short time we\u2019ve been an independent company, but we know we have more work to do. Our recent results and guidance indicate we are well positioned to accelerate value creation in 2021 and beyond, including progressing on our products through the ramp-up of our proprietary Enlist system and strengthening our advantaged multi-channel, multi-brand route to market, continuing to transform our crop protection portfolio and enhance our higher value product mix, and further streamlining costs and disciplined execution on our productivity actions. We will also maintain our balanced capital allocation program, continuing to return cash to shareholders even as we invest in long-term sustainable growth. Corteva\u2019s board and management team are fully aligned on a strategy to deploy our competitive advantages to deliver increased value that is durable. Our plan is solid. We are executing and it is working. At the same time, we are always open to perspectives that benefit all of our shareholders. At Corteva, we believe in the fundamental importance of listening and incorporating ideas that will help advance our mission and our objectives, and we continue to do that.  While I am pleased with our progress, I am not satisfied with our relatively flat earnings over the past three years. We have learned, we\u2019ve adapted, and are now very well positioned to accelerate our growth and deliver on the tremendous opportunities we have created through our targeted investments and disciplined emphasis on cost and productivity. As I consider our path ahead, there is no doubt we have aligned our culture and gained the trust of our customers. At the same time, we have the right products and our portfolio transformation is underway, and we have the productivity programs in place to deliver our future. Through disciplined and focused execution, we are confident this plan will deliver meaningful earnings growth and margin expansion in the near term and significant sustained, long-term value for all of our shareholders, and importantly puts Corteva fully on track to achieve our midterm targets. I\u2019ll hand the call back to you, Jeff. Jeff Rudolph : Thank you Jim. Now let\u2019s move onto your questions. I would like to remind you that our cautions on forward-looking statements, non-GAAP measures and pro forma financials apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : [Operator instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Joel Jackson : Good morning everyone. Jim and Greg, as we look at your 2021 bridge on Slide 12, could you maybe outline where you think the guidance is most conservative and where you think it\u2019s most aggressive? Thank you. Jim Collins : Thanks Joel. Yes, as we\u2019ve said in the opening comments, 2021 is a big step forward for us, and I really believe we\u2019ve reached an acceleration point given the investments and the strategies that we\u2019ve been putting in place since 2017, and believe they will drive substantial earnings for the years ahead. As a starting point for \u201921, I think you\u2019ve got to look at that fourth quarter momentum. That momentum is there and it\u2019s real, and it gives you a strong sense for where that growth is going to come from.  As we\u2019ve guided for \u201921, as you see on the chart, that 15% to 20% improvement in EBITDA, and that\u2019s a 200 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin, I believe that guide is strong and it\u2019s realistic. As you\u2019ve asked, let me give you some proof points on why I have some confidence in it. Two-thirds of the improvement in the business this next year is going to come through our crop protection business, and that\u2019s tied to the productivity improvements that we\u2019ve put in place - a number of footprint reduction projects, as they have started to flow through cost of sales, and you can really begin to see that in our CP margins. You add to that the continued ramp-up of either the new products that we\u2019ve talked so much about, about $300 million or so of incremental new product sales, and then you start to unleash the spinosyn capacity that we have been investing in, so overall you get about $400 million of growth there.  Then all of that on crop protection is net of now the strategic decisions that we made to exit a number of key products, so while those decisions have been headwinds in the past, we\u2019ve got those behind us now, so the numbers we\u2019re talking to you about are net numbers.  Then about a third of that improvement next year is tied to our seed business, and you\u2019ve really got to start that discussion by just looking at Latin America, he tremendous momentum we carried in the fourth quarter, and then you add to that expectations of, I don\u2019t know, 5 million to 8 million acres of new crop coming back into corn and soybeans in North America, probably heavily weighted to soybeans, but it\u2019s real out there. You can see it tied to the really strong demand that\u2019s in the marketplace, and that\u2019s being reflected in commodity prices. Then the other confidence I have in our seed business is with respect to pricing. You look at what we delivered in 2020, 2% price improvement in corn and 2% price improvement in soybeans globally, we\u2019ve got a track record now there and so we\u2019re going to count on that track record. We will have a little headwind in the seed business tied to commodity prices and cost of sales, and then don\u2019t forget about Brevant as we\u2019re thinking about the bridge next year. We\u2019re just scratching the surface of what Brevant as well as Enlist is going to be able to deliver for us. I think this is a strong and realistic guide for 2021, and I have a lot of confidence in this plan and my team that we can deliver that. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you, good morning. Jim, on your 2022 target, which implies about--I think about $2.95 billion at the midpoint, can you bridge that roughly $500 million increase versus \u201921 vis-\u00e0-vis cost, new products, productivity, etc.? Jim Collins : Great David, thanks for the question. You\u2019re right - in our outline, our prepared remarks today, we really are affirming our midterm targets, and that\u2019s that 12% to 16% EBITDA growth using 2019 as a baseline. We\u2019re not going to provide guidance for 2022--you know, specific guidance for 2022, but we do see that continued momentum that I was just talking about that we have going into 2021. It\u2019s a little hard to sit here today and predict the market in \u201922, but we can talk about the levers that are still going to be within our control, that have given me confidence to confirm those midterm targets. You start in seed with really Enlist, and in 2021 we\u2019re just scratching the surface on the margin lift that Enlist can deliver for us. By 2022, we\u2019re really into the noticeable improvement in net royalty expense as we not only ramp up the top line revenue but we ramp up the proprietary portion of those sales that are in Corteva germplasm, and then we\u2019re going to continue to see improvement in the rest of our portfolio in a few other areas. Then I mentioned--I always need to keep reminding folks about Brevant. Again, \u201921, it\u2019s going to be a good year, a good start year for us, but 2022 will allow us to continue that momentum into that retail channel with Brevant. On crop protection, the main story there is momentum. We delivered $250 million of new product incremental revenue in 2020. \u201921 is going to be another strong year with about $300 million of incremental from those new products. We had 140 new product registrations that were received right here at the end of 2020 that will just start having momentum in \u201921, and you\u2019ll feel that again in \u201922. Then on top of the top line revenue that we\u2019ll get from crop protection, by \u201922 we\u2019re really starting to see the compounding effects of better margins on that new chemistry as higher volumes flow through that same asset base and take up--you know, we start to spread that fixed cost over a much broader base. You\u2019re seeing some of that in \u201921, but as those new product sales continue to ramp, it shows up in \u201922, on top of that, the further improvements that you\u2019re going to see from the asset footprint work that we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019ve got a good start at that this year coming up and it\u2019ll show up next year.  All of these levers, we really have within our control and, again, while it\u2019s early, we\u2019ve still got \u201921 to get through and tough to predict what that market will look like, but we\u2019ve got our hands firmly on these levers and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to propel us to those midterm targets. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning everyone. Jim, if I could ask on seed production costs, I believe they were up in 2020 somewhere in the $75 million to $100 million range, and most of that was on production issues, I think in soy. Then this year, you\u2019re talking about another $100 million, so on a two-year stack, if my math\u2019s right, you\u2019re up $175 million to $200 million. I guess my question is if we have sort of normal production in the U.S. and Europe this year and if the futures curve for corn and soy is correct and commodity prices are lower into next year, does that mean there\u2019s going to be $170 million to $200 million seed production cost tailwind in \u201922, or would some of that be eaten up by other costs, maybe extend launch costs or anything else? How should we be thinking about that bridge? Thank you. Jim Collins : Thanks Vincent for the question, and you\u2019re right - for 2021, we are expecting approximately $100 million in seed input cost headwinds. Those are predominantly due to the higher commodity prices for soybeans that impact our grower compensation program, the way we compensate growers for producing seed. We also had lower seed field yields in Europe - it was a tough seed production year.  Just as background, we go out and we contract with independent growers to produce our commercial seed, and they have the opportunity to lock in a commodity price rate during a window, and especially with soybeans as we saw that run-up late in the season, they locked in at higher rates. We go into every year with our best foot forward, so as we put seed in the ground in \u201921 for \u201922 production, clearly we will lap those higher commodity prices, and if we see some tail off there, we\u2019ll benefit from that. We\u2019ll expect to always have good solid yield production in our fields. We work with a lot of irrigated fields, so we try to take the weather out of that as much as possible.  We\u2019ve seen good trends, and I think we\u2019ve got a lot in play that should help us support us as we come out of \u201921 and into \u201922. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from PJ Juvekar with Citi. PJ Juvekar : Yes, hi. Good morning. A couple of related questions, Jim, on seeds. Are you seeing that farmers are willing to buy higher priced seeds given that they have strong disposable income this year? Just related to that, on your fixed minimum royalty payments that you have through 2023, which I think that\u2019s more of a cash flow item, can you talk about the income statement impact as you ramp up volumes of Enlist E3 and ramp down volumes of Round UP [indiscernible] yield? Thank you. Jim Collins : Good morning PJ. I\u2019ll talk to the pricing question and maybe have Greg walk you through the impacts of the way that balance sheet and the royalties flow. As we think about the market this season, 2021, it\u2019s always a competitive marketplace, and it will be just as competitive as we saw in 2020 even with the commodity pricing backdrop, so we\u2019re going to continue to go out there and get paid for the value that we deliver to growers, especially when it comes to the yield advantaged technology that we\u2019re putting out there, and most notably we really do see that in corn. We\u2019ve established a really strong track record that I mentioned earlier of extracting that value for our technology, and all you\u2019ve got to do is go back and look at our 2020 performance where we delivered 2% pricing in corn and soybeans, and that\u2019s globally. This is always a market-specific phenomenon, but when you step back and look at our performance last year, we did that everywhere. As we sit here today, we\u2019re very pleased with the pace of the orders that are coming in, in both our Pioneer brand in North America as well as the Brevant brand through those channels, and so I\u2019m confident on that value question that we\u2019ll carry that momentum into 2021. Greg, you want to talk a little bit about royalties? Greg Friedman : Yes PJ, on royalties, we are in 2020 a relatively flat on our royalty spend, and we\u2019ll continue into 2021 pretty much on the same basis. As we go into 2022 and start ramping up more of our proprietary products in germplasm, we\u2019ll start to see that royalty expense come down, and that will continue beyond 2022 through the rollout of Enlist through the end of the decade. We do, as you know, have some minimum payments that we make every year. Those will end in 2023. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the progress in \u201920. I just wanted to ask about the margin progression and evolution that you\u2019re seeing you\u2019ve achieved and you see over the next couple years. It looks like you\u2019re guiding to about a 17% EBITDA margin at the midpoint in \u201921, and you\u2019ve outlined some new restructuring initiatives for footprint optimization and such. Do you see maybe this as a first step and maybe some other projects down the road - maybe you can expand on the opportunities that you see, and if so, where do you think margins ultimately can get to, and what would it be dependent on? Would it be dependent on maybe further market growth or some inorganic growth, or maybe some different asset structuring or potentially even some different business lines, like formulation or anything like that?  There\u2019s a lot in there, but maybe you can address some of that. Thanks. Jim Collins : Great Arun, and thanks for your comment as well. Due to the merger, we did inherit a number of U.S. manufacturing locations that have been more expensive than what I had personally experienced in the past around a more outsourced or a more localized approach to the business. We didn\u2019t wait to take any actions to start optimizing the supply chain. Since merge, since the close of the merger, we\u2019ve shut down nine manufacturing assets, and we are starting to see the benefits of those lower cost supply chains, so I do believe that 2021 is really an inflection point for us.  We really haven\u2019t seen much of the benefits of those actions yet, and that\u2019s kind of related to the amount of time that it takes to clear the regulatory hurdles. Every time you make a change in your supply chain, you have to go back and resubmit dossiers to regulatory authorities in every country around the world. You saw some restructuring, the 8-K that we filed that had restructuring in it - that\u2019s just part of those programs that we\u2019ve talked about, and we\u2019ll just continue to roll forward. In our guides, in our confirmation of our midterm targets, we\u2019ve included those strategic decisions in those guides. It\u2019s one of the tools that we have, one of the ways that we get there and have confidence that they\u2019re achievable, and then we\u2019re always looking for opportunities and new ideas. We take every one of our active ingredients that we produce and we ask ourselves the question, can we be the lowest cost producer of that product? When that answer is no, the teams begin looking for alternate sources. When that answer is yes but we need project work to get there, we begin to put those initiatives in place to drive that. The best example I could point to is if you look at 2021\u2019s EBITDA improvement, two-thirds of that improvement is going to be coming from those initiatives in our crop protection business, so I\u2019ve got a lot of confidence, a lot of great visibility of those initiatives that are in flight, and exactly where we are in each one of those manufacturing units and those cost of sales points to be able to point to that. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. I have a question about your conservative operating cash flow guidance in that your \u201921-\u201922 total is $3 billion to $3.5 billion, so let\u2019s call it, I don\u2019t know, $1.7 billion a year. This year, your operating cash flow is $2 billion. If you subtract out your working capital benefits, maybe it\u2019s $1.7 billion, so you\u2019re sort of saying that your operating cash flow is not really going to change very much from that base. You know, there\u2019ll be a little bit more working capital, but your EBITDA you think will go from $2 billion to $3 billion over--you know, to 2022. I don\u2019t understand why you would be generating so much EBITDA and so little operating cash flow. Then secondly, your pension liability really went down in the fourth quarter, I think sequentially from something like $5.8 billion to $5.1 billion, but interest rates really fell year-over-year and I would have thought that there would have been an adjustment in the opposite direction. Can you explain what happened to pension, and can you explain why there\u2019s so little growth in operating cash flow? Jim Collins : Great Jeff, thanks for the question. Let me just start by saying I\u2019m really proud of how the team performed in 2020 from a cash flow perspective - you\u2019ve seen the numbers that we\u2019ve talked about, and also the plan that we\u2019ve put in place for 2021. That includes returning about--for 2021 when we complete the share buyback and the dividends, we\u2019re going to return $1.1 billion to shareholders. Let me turn it to Greg to talk a little bit about the future look on cash flows and that balance as you talked with EBITDA, and for the discussion of what happened to the pension.  Greg? Greg Friedman : Yes, specifically on cash flow, we had a very strong cash generation year, as you commented, this year. A lot of that was driven by real specific actions that we took to manage our working capital and also manage our capital spending, particularly during the pandemic. What also happened towards the end of the year is we saw some very good cash generation by our customers through the government programs that they received some benefit from, and in addition to that the rise in commodity prices towards the end of the year also generated some incremental income for our customers, and we got the benefit of that with some cash generation at the end of the year. As we go into 2021 and beyond, we are looking at increasing our capital spending. We were at $475 million in 2020 and you\u2019ll see in our guide that we\u2019ve included capex at about 550 in 2021, so we put some of our capex on hold and we plan to reinvest in our growth projects in 2021 and beyond. In addition to that, we do expect to return to a more normal cash-credit mix with our customers, so there will be some changes in working capital as we move through 2021 and assuming a more normalized cash-credit mix. Jim Collins : Great, and do you want to talk about pensions? Greg Friedman : Yes, so on pensions specifically, we saw a net decrease in the obligation, and that was driven by two things : number one, an increase in the gross obligation given discount rates, and that was offset by our asset returns. Jim Collins : The other thing, Jeff, just to highlight is our unfunded balance declined, and that was mostly due to changes in the OPEB obligation as a result of some changes that we made in benefits. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Jonas Oxgaard : Thank you and good morning. You mentioned earlier that you were seeing some share gains in South America crop protection. I was wondering if you could expand on share gains in corn, soybean, and crop protection in other regions. Then as a follow-up, how do you see that evolving this year? Jim Collins : Great Jonas, thanks. We are confident that we gained corn market share for sure in Europe and in Brazil, both in the Safrinha season as well as summer, and we\u2019ve got just a fantastic line-up and our teams really executed very, very well. It\u2019s a little too early to call on share gains in North America. We really have to get that last round of USDA data that give us plantings and what happened right down to a county level, so we\u2019ll have that final call on North America in mid-March. But look - I\u2019m confident that we held share at least for sure in corn in North America while delivering above market pricing gains, so our story in North America was really all about value.  In soybeans from a global perspective, we saw some slight declines in volumes, but for us it\u2019s the U.S. that really matters, and our U.S. seed volumes in soybeans were up, so I\u2019m pretty confident in soy as well. We held, if not we were up slightly, and one more time, in soybeans that 2% pricing on a look back basis shows that we not only have we held if not gained slightly and drove much higher value.  Those are the big markets, but maybe Tim, do you want to share either a broader perspective of how we\u2019re doing on market share in other markets around the world, other crops? Tim Glenn : Yes Jim, maybe I\u2019d add a couple comments on the crop protection side, especially looking back at 2020. I think we can confidently say we gained share in crop protection, I think on a global basis. We obviously are still in the early days and we don\u2019t have all the competitive metrics in place, but it certainly seems like on a global basis that we would have outperformed the market on CP as well as I think we can confidently say in EMEA as well as Asia-Pacific, we\u2019ve been ahead of the market really throughout the year and had strong finishes there. In North America, we\u2019ve sort of been hanging with the market for most of the year in crop protection, and then we had a strong finish to the year as well, so we\u2019ll see where that [indiscernible], but a little optimistic that we will end up above the market for North America, we\u2019ll have strong finish, and in Latin America fair to say that we started off the year behind the market in the first half. We felt like we were catching as we went through the third quarter, and a really strong finish in the fourth quarter as we anticipated. Again, I thin much like North America, we have some reason to believe that once everything is tallied up that we\u2019re going to be certainly with the market, and maybe just ahead of it on the crop protection side. So in conjunction with the seed share position that Jim talked about, I think we can feel really proud of how we performed versus the market on the crop protection side, again with strong pricing to support it. Jim Collins : Great Tim. Thanks for mentioning the crop protection. You mentioned Latin America right there at the end - Jonas, our insecticide business in the fourth quarter in Latin America was up 36%, and our fungicide business in Latin America was up 28%, so as Tim said, really strong close for the year by that team. On a full year basis, we were also up similar numbers, so we\u2019re encouraged by our CP market share as well. Thanks Jonas. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Just a follow-up on capital allocation, it sounds like you\u2019re going to be mostly done with your share repurchase commitment by the middle of the year, so how would you describe the potential for future repurchases versus the M&A opportunities that you described, Jim, in fruits and vegetables, digital and biologicals?  Then related to that for Greg, can you comment on other cash calls or expectations for 2021 in terms of pension, OPEB, PFAS, and any other extraordinary items? Thank you. Jim Collins : Thanks Kevin. As we mentioned in our message earlier, we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate opportunities to return capital to shareholders and we view that as a priority in our overall scheme for capital allocation. We mentioned that we are committed to executing the current share repurchase program and now plan to complete, as you said, most of that program by mid-\u201921. That is a further acceleration from where we were and where we communicated back in 3Q. Then on a look forward basis, you look at that combined with our dividend, we\u2019ll be a little over $1.1 billion returned to shareholders. At that time, as that program closes out, we\u2019ll take a view of all of our obligations and sit down with our board and talk about what\u2019s next after that, but I\u2019m confident that returning capital to shareholders is a priority for me and it\u2019s a priority for this board, and we\u2019ll certainly keep you informed as our thoughts around that evolve. Greg? Greg Friedman : Yes, on cash calls, you mentioned pension and OPEB. Specifically with respect to the pension, we continue to be confident that we don\u2019t have a required contribution to the pension plan in the next couple years; in fact, as I mentioned earlier, our returns this year exceeded the cost of the plan, so our funded rate improved. You\u2019ll see the details of all of that in the 10-K when we issue that in the next several days, so apologize for not having the details readily available for you for that. Regarding OPEB, no additional cash calls other than what we normally see on an annual basis, and as Jim mentioned, with the changes that we made to the plan, that reduced the liability significantly. Jim Collins : Thanks Greg. Thanks Kevin. Operator : Our last question will come from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Thank you. Good morning. Jim, you mentioned seven-year high on crop commodity prices, and if you look at that another way, the growers that are locking in harvest month futures prices today versus what they were doing a year ago, they\u2019re looking at $100 an acre higher revenue today than they were a year ago. My question for you on that is how do you think that most affects the decisions those farmers make? Is it seed genetics, is it shift to branded crop chemicals, is it application rates? How do you think it most affects your verticals? Then the second question there would be your 2021 guide of a 3% sales growth is the same as it was in 2020. Is it reasonable to see that as not really a middle of the road but a not to miss guide? Jim Collins : Great, thanks Steve. Clearly improving commodity price markets helps the psychology of everybody involved, and farmers always think about their decisions as investments in their future to drive productivity and yield, so higher commodity prices means they will continue to push for yield and be able to take advantage of that yield. What I like about what we\u2019re seeing right now is we feel like the demand side of this equation that\u2019s driving those commodity prices is pretty durable for the one to two-year term as we look out. China\u2019s demand curve seems to be strong as they\u2019re rebuilding their pork industry, and we know we\u2019ve got demand for exports in other markets and strong demand for animal feed that we\u2019re seeing come back in North America, and with the carry-over stocks where we\u2019re seeing them.  I, like you, believe that we have support for those commodity prices here for the next two or three years, and that\u2019s driving our acreage assumptions as well. I would expect 182 million corn and soybean acres when you combine them. It\u2019s a little hard to call the split there, but probably the best news we\u2019re hearing right now is we don\u2019t seem to be--it\u2019s going to favor soybeans, we know that. Any increases will go into soybean acreage, but it\u2019s not coming out of corn, so it\u2019s really setting up for both a strong corn and bean. When you look at our revenue guide for next year, as you mentioned, just remember that in that guide, that is a net top line revenue number and it\u2019s net of about $300 million of revenue that we phased out of from 2020, going into \u201921, the first of those strategic decisions around chlorpyrifos, and then in several other low margin products, very, very generic, and just probably not the right kind of products for our portfolio going forward. We\u2019re certainly in a mix enrichment and refreshment of that portfolio and basically have the majority of those big strategic decisions now behind us. Back to my comment earlier, I think this guide is a strong and a realistic guide with all of those elements really baked into it, and we still have a full season ahead. We\u2019re sitting here early in \u201921 with a lot to go, but we\u2019re confident we\u2019ve set this at the right spot. Thanks Steve. Jeff Rudolph : Great, well thank you for joining the call today, and we appreciate your interest in Corteva. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s presentation. Thank you for your participation.

Jeff Rudolph : Good morning and welcome to Corteva\u2019s first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Jim Collins, Chief Executive Officer and Dave Anderson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Tim Glenn, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer and Rajan Gajaria, Executive Vice President of Business Platforms, will join the Q& A session. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks during this call, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of the Corteva website and through the link to our webcast. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are our expectations for or about the future. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could materially differ from these statements due to these risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, those discussed on this call and in the Risk Factors section of our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. On our Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and related schedules, along with our supplemental financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks for today\u2019s call. These items provide a reconciliation of differences between reported GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered as substitute for the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Collins : Thank you, Jeff and welcome to the participants joining the call today. Starting on Slide 4, as I step back and reflect on how the organization closed out 2020 with strong sales and earnings growth in the fourth quarter, it is impressive how our teams executed in a very complex and dynamic market environment with the overlay of the COVID pandemic. It displays the focus and execution of our strategy and the commitment to delivering value. That momentum was sustained through the first quarter. And through focused heads down execution, we delivered a strong start to the year, with margin increases in both segments. I am really pleased with these results. Our technology leadership remains strong, evidenced by ongoing demand for our new and differentiated products. We continue to launch and rapidly scale these technologies, while taking focused actions on our cost and productivity priorities. Collectively, this focus on our commitments is helping to drive meaningful margin expansion today and looking forward. Importantly, our team around the world delivering these results is resilient. They continue to prove their agility in the face of ongoing market volatility, including the pandemic and remain intent on prioritizing the safety of colleagues, while serving our customers and stakeholders at every turn. And lastly, I am pleased to also share that we welcomed 4 new directors to our Board during the quarter. The addition of these directors and their background and experience will complement an already strong and diverse board and will serve as a catalyst for the ongoing advancement of our strategy, reinforcing our commitment to deliver on our value creation priorities. So, let\u2019s look at Slide 5 which is our financial results for the quarter. We delivered strong organic sales growth across both seed and crop protection, leading to 6% organic growth for the company as a whole. Importantly, we realized better operating leverage on our sales growth this quarter as operating EBITDA grew 14% and margins expanded more than 150 basis points, a strong execution on our growth targets, coupled with improved SG&A more than offset the market-driven cost headwinds we faced in the quarter. The phenomena of the market-driven cost inflation, is a common theme we are seeing across industries, including raw materials and logistics. Dave is going to take us through the key market dynamics and other critical drivers for the remainder of 2021. On capital allocation, we returned approximately $450 million to shareholders in the quarter via share buybacks and dividends. And we remain on track to complete the majority of our remaining repurchases under the $1 billion program by the first half of 2021. Returning cash to shareholders continues to be a high priority for Corteva and a critical part of our balanced approach to capital allocation. This first quarter performance is another important proof point that our value creation strategy is working, reinforcing our confidence that we will meet our commitments for 2021. Shifting to the market backdrop on Slide 6, we remain encouraged by the strengthening global ag fundamentals, while also navigating macroeconomic uncertainties around the world. The ag outlook turned positive in the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of rising farm income levels and constructive demand out of China. Today, farm incomes remain elevated on strong commodity prices and we continue to see record global demand for ag commodities. As a result, we are seeing ending stocks drawn down and expectations that grower income levels will be at all-time highs even with the easing government payments this year. In March, the USDA issued the prospective planting survey results, which indicated flattish corn acres, an approximate 5 million acre increase in soybeans for the U.S. As you recall, our original estimates were between 5 million and 8 million additional acres coming into corn and bean production for 2021, mostly going into soybeans. Given how we position our products with our customers, we are in a good position to take advantage of any potential upside in acres as market conditions continue to evolve. Commodity prices in Brazil remain strong as concerns of dry weather or lowering expectations on safrinha yields. We also expect to see planted area expansion in Brazil, with the potential for low to mid single-digit increases in corn planted area for the late 2021 early 2022 season. Although exchange rates have recently trended favorably, the market remains volatile and we continue to monitor for any further fluctuations. More importantly, based on how we are seeing the futures markets shape up, we believe these fundamentals will continue into at least 2022 as strong grain demand and supply challenges keep ending stocks low. This constructive backdrop provides Corteva further momentum for value creation as growers turn to best-in-class technology to maximize productivity and value. So, let\u2019s turn to Slide 7 and I will provide some more detail on the strength of our global sales diversity and where we are capitalizing on momentum across the globe. In North America, organic sales were down 2% for the quarter against a difficult 2020 seed comparison. While 2020 first quarter seed volumes benefited from early demand amidst favorable weather conditions, we experienced a more normalized delivery pattern this year. We expect corn volumes to increase in the second quarter as our seed deliveries in the U.S. Pioneer brand have caught up to the prior year as of today. On seed pricing, first quarter was negatively impacted mostly due to brand mix. Our second quarter deliveries to-date reflect improvement in corn pricing despite aggressive market competitiveness. We remain excited about the demand and traction we are seeing in the Enlist soybean launch and still expect Enlist to represent about 30% of the U.S. soybean market in 2021, an important milestone towards our goal of 50% market penetration. North America Crop Protection had a strong start to the year, with 11% organic growth on strong demand for new technologies, including Enlist herbicide and solid pricing execution in response to rising raw material freight and logistics costs. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, organic sales grew 6% on record corn and sunflower seed volumes as supply concerns and commodity cost pressures drove an early start to the spring sales season. Our portfolio of new and differentiated products, such as Arylex and Rinskor herbicides, remain in high demand, which enabled us to drive price and volume in crop protection. During the quarter, we also obtained key regulatory approvals, including the registration of Univoq fungicide with Inatreq active for sale and use in the UK, a major milestone for serial growers needing innovative and sustainable chemistry solutions to protect their crops. In Latin America, we delivered 38% organic sales growth on strong volumes and execution of our price for value strategy. And seed volumes grew 39% on strong Brazil safrinha sales and early demand in other countries. In Crop Protection, volume grew 10% on significant demand for new and differentiated technologies such as Isoclast and Jemvelva insecticides and Enlist herbicides. Pricing actions reflect strong product demand and partially offset unfavorable currency impacts in the Brazilian real. In Asia-Pacific, we realized 9% organic sales growth compared to the prior year on both volume and price improvements. While seed volumes were down on the shift of some corn sales to the second half, crop protection growth was led by further penetration of Jemvelva and Pyraxal insecticides. Now, Dave will provide more detail on our results and our expectations for the rest of the year. But let me first say, we are very excited to have Dave join the Corteva team and I look forward to the contributions he will make in bolstering our momentum and execution looking ahead. So, Dave, over to you. Dave Anderson : Thanks, Jim, very much and welcome everybody to this morning\u2019s call. Let\u2019s go to Slide 8 for a more detailed review of our strong first quarter operating EBITDA performance. You can see that operating EBITDA grew from $794 million last year to $904 million in the first quarter of 2021, representing a $110 million improvement. It\u2019s a clear testament to the momentum that Jim mentioned. Driving this increase were price benefits of $125 million and volume benefits of $50 million from strong commercial execution and penetration of our new and differentiated products across all regions. It represents important progress on our targets and really reflects the strength of our portfolio and pipeline. On new Crop Protection products, we recognized sales growth of over $120 million. At the same time, we delivered record corn and sunflower volumes in Europe and strong safrinha sales in Brazil, which helped to offset the seasonal timing of seed deliveries in North America. Finally, we continue to extract value for our yield advantage technology in corn, with global corn pricing up 2% for the quarter. Now, costs were a $70 million net headwind to operating EBITDA for the quarter. This reflects approximately $50 million in productivity and other cost actions positively, which were more than offset by higher input in freight costs, which are primarily market-driven. Let me give you some color on that. As economies across the globe start to emerge from the pandemic-related shutdowns, global trade markets are experiencing a higher shipping demand leading to higher freight costs. Additionally, prices of certain active ingredients and intermediates have risen compared to the same period last year. As a result, we incurred approximately $120 million of cost headwinds in the quarter due to increased freight and logistics, higher raw material costs and unfavorable seed yields in Europe. Now, we are taking action where possible to mitigate these impacts, including delivering on our productivity initiatives and passing through certain inflationary costs for our seed and crop protection products. For example, late in the first quarter, we initiated on average mid single-digit price increases in the U.S. on our Crop Protection products. Taken together, we delivered over 150 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter as a result of the discipline and focused execution despite the cost increases that we encountered. Let\u2019s go now to Slide 9 focused on crop protection for the quarter and cover a few highlights. As you can see, Crop Protection organic sales grew 12% in the quarter, driven by a 6% increase in volume and a 6% increase in price. Now keep in mind, including with this volume, growth is a 5% headwind from our strategic decision to phase-out certain products, primarily in the insecticides portfolio, including Chlorpyrifos as well as Telone. Now, strong global demand for our new technology led to an increase of more than $120 million in new product sales when compared to the same period last year. Herbicides were up 20% compared to the first quarter of 2020 led by continued penetration of Arylex and Enlist. Fungicides grew 14% driven by strong demand for Zorvec and also Inatreq, primarily in Europe, Middle East and Africa. And lastly, insecticides grew 2% in the quarter, largely driven by our differentiated Spinosyns technology, notably Jemvelva as well as Qalcova. These were up 29% in the quarter. Now, this growth was again muted by our decision to phase-out select insecticides, as mentioned earlier. Favorable product mix in Crop Protection and strategic price increases drove pricing gains in the quarter, including an 18% price improvement in Latin America and a 6% price improvement in North America. Operating EBITDA for Crop Protection improved 35% for the quarter, driven by robust demand for new products and pricing execution. Now, we experienced cost headwinds of approximately $70 million for this segment. And again, these included increased raw material costs, such as precious metals used as catalysts as well as increased freight and logistics. Taken on the whole, these headwinds more than offset our productivity actions. As we go forward, we are aggressively managing controllable factors and at the same time, proactively mitigating this cost through delivering against our productivity programs, passing through certain costs for our products wherever possible. Very impressively, despite these challenges I mentioned, we drove over 300 basis points of improvement of operating EBITDA margin in the segment in the quarter. Let\u2019s go now to the seed segment on Slide 10. You can see organic sales per seed were up 3%, driven by strong Brazil safrinha sales and record corn and sunflower volumes in Europe on an early start to the spring. These gains were partially offset by the seasonal timing of deliveries in North America, where seed volumes in the quarter were down 6%, driven by the U.S. where we had a very early start in the prior year. Overall, global corn volumes were flat, reflecting these seasonal shifts. On pricing, we maintained our track record in extracting value for our yield advantage technology, with corn prices up 2% for the quarter. Soybean volumes were also flat for the quarter, with price down 4%. Now keep in mind, the first quarter is a meaningful quarter for soybeans since the large majority of the deliveries occur in the second quarter. And as Jim mentioned, our expectations for Enlist E3, the ramp there is on track. Other oil seeds were up 19% versus the first quarter of 2020 reflecting record sunflower volumes in Europe and higher canola volumes in Canada. Operating EBITDA for this segment improved 6% on strong price execution globally, ongoing cost and productivity actions and a gain on the remeasurement of an R&D technology-based equity investment, which is included in the other column. These improvements were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency and higher input costs, which were primarily market related. These cost increases included again higher freight and logistics costs, coupled with the impact of unfavorable seed yields on European corn. The teams continue to manage through these headwinds and still delivered operating EBITDA margin improvement of over 100 basis points per seed for the quarter. So, now let\u2019s go to Slide 11, talk about our first half 2021 updated expectations and full year 2021 guidance. With the backdrop of the segments, you can see we expect top line growth of about 3% for the half, led by continued strong demand for our new Crop Protection products globally. This growth includes an approximately $130 million sales headwind from strategic decisions to phase-out certain Crop Protection products. On the seed side, we are monitoring what ultimately gets planted this season in North America given recent strengthening in commodity price levels. Globally, we expect first half seed volumes to be about flat with the prior year. We are confident that we will maintain our momentum and we continue to extract value for our yield advantage technology in corn globally. Turning to costs, we remain committed to the execution and realization of our productivity programs, which we believe will be more than offset by anticipated headwinds from increasing freight and logistics, higher raw materials and unfavorable seed yields in Europe, resulting in a net headwind of $50 million for the half. Taken together, this translates to operating EBITDA of $2.15 billion to $2.25 billion for the half, an increase of 8% over 2020 at the midpoint and an approximate 120 basis point increase to operating EBITDA margins. Turning to the full year, we are raising our revenue guidance. We now expect reported net sales to be between $14.6 billion and $14.8 billion, up 3% to 4% over 2020. This increase reflects continued demand for new products globally in both our crop protection and seed segments, coupled with strong price execution in key regions on technology and pricing for higher costs, where possible. On cost, we expect a net headwind for the year of $50 million as the higher input costs and freight logistics are more than offsetting productivity savings. Specific to G&A spend, we are maintaining our post-COVID spending levels with anticipation that G&A will be essentially flat for the year, with the organization driving inflation impacts to a net zero for G&A. Reflecting the strength of what we are seeing in the market and focused execution, we remain on track to deliver operating EBITDA between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion for the year, an improvement of 17% over 2020 at the midpoint and approximately 200 basis points of margin improvement. Standing back, here are the key takeaways for the quarter. First, we delivered an impressive start to the year in both top and bottom line, driven by penetration of technology advantaged products despite some headwinds. And second, we remain on track to deliver strong double-digit earnings improvement for the year. So, before turning the call back to Jim, I just want to take a second to provide a few initial observations since joining Corteva last month. Coming into the company, I have been impressed with the tremendous franchise that Corteva represents. It\u2019s backed by a strong culture and high-value assets, which I believe in combination are capable of delivering on the significant growth potential. Leveraging what I have referred to as the CFO skill set, it provides a great opportunity to help deliver the operating leverage we see for the business. Those are early thoughts. I look forward to sharing more with you in the future and working with the team on executing Corteva\u2019s strategy. And with that, I will turn it back over to Jim. Jim Collins : Great. Thanks, Dave. And before we get to your questions, let me offer a few final comments. As you can see in our results, this organization is executing. We are off to a strong start to the year. And despite some of the unplanned headwinds from market-related factors, we are on track with our expectations. And as we look ahead, we remain focused on driving progress against those fundamental elements of our strategy, advancing our industry leading innovation pipeline, including the ramp-up of our proprietary Enlist system, and delivering on our productivity and cost savings initiatives and maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Now we have considerable momentum right now, and we expect focused execution in our plan will enable us to continue to generate value and deliver on our commitments to our shareholders. The market backdrop is clearly strengthening. And despite macro uncertainties, we expect favorable market dynamics to continue through the mid-term. Our current pace is aligned with our mid-term earnings targets, and we are well positioned to create significant durable value for shareholders in 2021 and beyond. And finally, at the foundation of this is a fully focused team and a strong legacy of technology leadership, which can be traced all the way back to the founding of the Pioneer brand, which, by the way, just celebrated its 95th anniversary. This legacy and a shared sense of accountability for our commitments and our purpose demonstrates that the culture we have built at Corteva is solid. The events of this past year have left an undeniable impact on all of us. Our Corteva teams rose to this challenge, prioritizing the safety of our colleagues, our customers and our communities and our teams around the world continue to do that today. 2021 has proven that the pandemic recovery remains uneven and an ongoing focus on our values, including safety, are just going to remain critical as this global health crisis intensifies in parts of the world, such as India. As a global citizen, with operations in 140 countries, we remain as committed as ever to taking actions locally in the communities in which we operate. Harnessing the power of our scale provides to deliver value for all of our stakeholders. So, let me now hand the call back to Jeff. Jeff Rudolph : Thank you, Jim. Now let\u2019s move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning Jim. Jim Collins : Good morning Dave. David Begleiter : Jim, just on costs and productivity, can you remind us what you were expecting for the year initially versus what looks like a $50 million net headwind right now? Jim Collins : Yes. Great, Dave. Thanks for the question. And I would start by saying we had a lot coming at us, but had really great start by the team, and it\u2019s always kind of tough to call that first quarter, kind of second quarter split. But we are, I think, executing pretty well. There are some things, some areas that we are still watching some trends that are moving up on us, that may be a little bit greater than we started the year. And a lot of that starts with commodity prices. Those are going to continue to affect our seed production costs. And a little of that is for full year, kind of back-end loaded as we watch production costs in Brazil and harvest seed and get ready for that commercial season. There are some market driven cost headwinds. And maybe I will hand it over to Dave to share a little more detail on a few of those. But at the high level, it\u2019s things like freight and some of the key raw materials, and many of those are COVID related, transportation related, and some of those are just kind of global demand, really creating some shortages here and there. And I would say some of the other areas that are affecting costs are also COVID related. The recovery that we are seeing globally is a little bit uneven. We are seeing some flare-ups in parts of the world, like India and Brazil that are affecting transportation and logistics routes, but also affecting our customers and, in some cases, demand and supply. So, as I step back and I think about some of the opportunities that we are driving, this team is executing really well, and we are covering \u2013 essentially covering those costs with our outlook. We are \u2013 as we have said earlier, we are essentially on track with our full year guidance that we gave you. So, even though there are some new headwinds that I have mentioned, we have got those covered. And I think what we have done with this outlook is taken a really balanced approach here and continue to monitor and watch these. But Dave, do you want to share any more detail for Dave on that? Dave Anderson : Sure. Thanks Dave, by the way, good morning and nice to meet you. So, I think a couple of things, just to add a little bit to what Jim said and kind of back to your question. Number one, as you would suspect, we spent a lot of time on the subject. I mean, this is something that has really been a focus and attention of this leadership team, with this management team. And it\u2019s a headline item, obviously, not just for Corteva, its industry wide phenomena that you are seeing in a number of the releases. Some of the things that I think stand out, just to add a little bit to what Jim said. Number one, we are on track in terms of our annual productivity. That\u2019s the key message. The $250 million guide that we gave you at the beginning of the year, we are on track for that. So, what we are really talking about is what is the incremental impact relative to that. So, seed yields and commodity costs, that\u2019s the biggest item. For the quarter, we are impacted about \u2013 estimate of about $30 million and about $150 million for the full year. Sea freight and logistics would be second, followed by glysophate, precious metals, the catalyst in terms of use in our crop protection processes. And then the core protection supply and freight. These make up in total, the delta that we are talking about in terms of impact for the year, so whereas previously, we had net of productivity positive for the year. Now what we are looking at is negative $50 million impact for the year as a result of all of this. So, that\u2019s a big impact for us. The delta, previously, if you looked at, again, productivity of $250 million, our previous guide would have been that we would have had positive, about $150 million net. Now we are looking at net $50 million negative. So, that\u2019s the $200 million swing that we talked about for the year. Hopefully, that helps. And then, just to reinforce what Jim said, the best judgments we have right now we will continue to refine this and also taking a step back just to reinforce that we are on track for the full year in terms of that EBITDA growth and that EBITDA margin improvement. David Begleiter : Great. No, that was very helpful. And just Jim, one last thing, the implied Q2 guide is a little bit below consensus, but the first half guide is a lot of consensus. So, is this really just a timing issue again, Q1 versus Q2? Jim Collins : Yes. Absolutely, Dave. It is always hard to call that first quarter, second quarter mark. And while we talked in the opening comments about a strong finish to the Latin America season and really strong start to Europe, I would say North America is a little bit behind the pace that we had last year, and you will see that North America pace tick up in 2Q. If we had 3 or 4 more good days of weather, North America might have been pretty much right on top of where they were last year. That\u2019s how much business can move in just those few days right around that quarter end. So as I sit here today, we have caught up on all of our shipments in North America to where we were this same day last year. I feel really good about where North America is going to finish. And you called it exactly right, Dave. We are on our plan for the half, and we expect to be right on plan for full year at this point. David Begleiter : Thank you very much. Operator : We will now take our next question from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson : Hi, good morning everyone. Jim Collins : Good morning Joel. Joel Jackson : Obviously, we are in an inflationary environment, commodity prices, and you had some of those pressures right now, and you have been able to mitigate that with price and volume. Can you talk about a little bit more granularity on the buckets that led to a couple of hundred million dollars of cost pressures here? I imagine it\u2019s things like glufosinate and paying Brazilian farmers more for their seeds. And as this continues, can you talk about the levers you can pull? Like should the inflationary environment positive for Corteva? And talk about how you can mitigate cost pressures and how it can be positive for you? Jim Collins : Sure, Joel. Let me mention a few comments. We will let Dave cover a little more of the details on those costs, and then maybe we can come back and talk about additional levers we have for the year. I want to reinforce one point that Dave made earlier, that our productivity programs that we launched at the beginning of the year are still on track. And that $250 million of productivity year-over-year is in flight. I feel really good about that. And as you mentioned, we have seen some of these headwinds. So Dave, do you want to talk about a few of those again? Dave Anderson : Sure. Let me \u2013 because I named the major categories earlier, Joel. Let me just give you a little more detail. I am going to talk about full year numbers now. So in terms of seed deals and modeling costs, we are now looking at around $150 million. Headwinds, seed freight and logistics, that\u2019s about 30 \u2013 lyphosate where \u2013 will actually affect pricing, obviously, in terms of pass through, that\u2019s about 50. And then rhodium, where that we saw, I think it was a 4x, Rajan, it increased in that spot price. That\u2019s now going to impact us for first and second quarter. But what the teams have done, and Rajan can talk a little more about that, but we are substituting now palladium for rhodium, but that\u2019s still a $50 million estimated impact for the full year. And then finally, on corn products, supply and freight, that\u2019s estimated to be about $20 million. And most of that, by the way, occurred in the first quarter. The first quarter number, by the way, those should \u2013 some \u2013 what I just gave it should sum to about $300 million. That $300 million compares significantly \u2013 negatively to what we had built into our previous forecast. And as I mentioned previously, net of productivity, we are now looking at a $50 million hit versus previous guide was $150 million positive. So, in other words, productivity more than offsetting cost, improved cost increases. Jim or Rajan, anything you guys would want to add in terms of those insights? Jim Collins : I will just close it out, Joel, as we asked about, as we look forward, other levers that we have. We are going to obviously finish through the first half here, get this North American market kind of behind us. We still have a lot of seed to put in the ground in North America. But then we have got that second hemisphere season ahead of us in Latin America. And I feel really good about the setup there, but we still have some pricing opportunities in the second half that we are going to explore. We still might have some volume. We are hearing that the Safrinha season, as acres expanded last year, we think we could see some acreage expansion. We found a little of that in already, but we are going to watch that really carefully. And then as I mentioned before, one of the big keys for us are those productivity initiatives. They are well underway. We have got good momentum there, and we are going to keep pressing those forward. So, as I said before, it\u2019s early. We are taking a real balanced view right now with this outlook that we have given, and we are going to keep updating it as the year unfolds. Thanks, Joel. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning everyone. If I could ask and start out in seed, the $112 million gain on the re-measurement of the equity investment. I guess, what is that equity investment? Was that $112 million in the original EBITDA guidance you gave at 4Q? And is it one-time in nature, such that if you don\u2019t revalue it higher again in the first quarter of next year, it\u2019s actually a headwind in the bridge from \u201821 to \u201822. So, maybe we could start with that? Thank you. Dave Anderson : Yes. Good morning Vincent. Nice to meet you. This is Dave. So, we recognized actually about a $14 million gain on the re-measurement of a strategic R&D technology equity investment in the quarter. So, it\u2019s relatively de minimis in the scheme of things. So, I think that\u2019s the important thing for you to understand. Now the one thing I think I would just add a little bit to that, while we are on the subject is, if you will, if you look at the total in terms of the other column, when we look at EBITDA walk or the EBITDA bridge, that also does include also some benefit of a reversal of a bad debt accrual that basically reflects very good collections activity and obviously, just the strength of farmer income. So, just the overall market environment is positive. But if you take those together, that represents in the neighborhood of about $30 million to $35 million for the quarter. In total for the year, it\u2019s part of our walk \u2013 when we do our bridge from where we were to where we are now in terms of, as Jim said, our balanced outlook, that is included in that. In the context of the overall performance and profitability and size of EBITDA for the company, again, I think it\u2019s relatively small in the scheme of things. But it\u2019s a good question. I am glad we are able to flag that and point that out. Jim Collins : Yes. And Vince, as you look at that chart, just to reinforce the message, the margin impact from that gain was 112 basis points, not dollars. So, as you look at the bottom of the chart, those are basis point numbers, not dollars. Dave Anderson : Yes, it\u2019s a very good point, Jim. And hopefully, that both the dollar amount that I mentioned to you, $14 million for that one item, the overall, if you will, other contribution to EBITDA, hopefully, that all puts it in perspective. Vincent Andrews : Thanks guys. Operator : We will now take our next question from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Good morning, Jim, and welcome, Dave. With corn prices approaching almost $7 per bushel and farmers flush with government payments, this would be the best time to raise seed pricing in North America. And I know, Jim, at your Analyst Day, you talked about your molecular stacks and your dual mode of action with the seeds. Why would your seed price down in the quarter and why aren\u2019t farmers buying better germplasm or traits? Jim Collins : Yes, great. P.J., thanks for the question. And we \u2013 obviously, you are right. We talked a lot about pricing in the past. And if you recall, on our fourth quarter call, we stated that we expected to continue to maintain the pricing for value strategies that we have had out there for a number of years. And that led to a 2% pricing in corn looking forward and looking back. And all of that mechanism that we had in place coming out of fourth quarter is still there. And so if I just look at our first quarter global seed pricing, we were up 2% and corn is also up 2%. So, that technology lift that you are mentioning is out there. Now also remember that in North America, we have essentially priced all of the seeds that we are delivering right now back in September of last year, and that was ahead of the big commodity run-up that we are starting to see. So, it\u2019s always a really competitive market out there. But our pricing for value strategy says that we are going to get paid for the yield advantage to technologies that we bring to our customers and most notably in corn. Tim, do you want to kind of maybe mention what you are seeing out there in the market, both from a corn and soybean perspective around what\u2019s going on in price? Tim Glenn : Yes, absolutely, Jim. And good morning P.J., I would say, as you said, corn pricing has been consistent with our expectations through the course of the season and good strong execution and I think we are getting paid for our advantaged portfolio. The thing we don\u2019t see is farmers switching their seed purchases based off of necessarily the price of grain corn. And they purchase technology package based off of the pest pressure that they deal with, and that really doesn\u2019t vary that much. And through good times and bad, they are very consistent with their purchases. So, that\u2019s there. We did have a slight phenomenon here in the first quarter where we had a different brand mix in the U.S., as Jim said, a little bit less Pioneer with the revenue recognition kind of that last mile to the hands of the farmer, so that impacted pricing a little arbitrarily there. But I think we are consistent with where we are. And obviously, as we look into 2022, we have got that lever, and we are clearly going to be looking at all factors around the value of our offer, what the market conditions are. And clearly, product cost considerations have to be part of that. Just to touch on soybeans a little bit. As we said earlier, we are very happy with where we are positioned in the marketplace in terms of the acceptance of Enlist E3, very widely available today and well accepted in the marketplace. But we are in a situation right now in the U.S. market for soybeans, where we are in a period of technology transition and that transition is, we have got Enlist E3 being rapidly adopted. We have had around [indiscernible] kind of transition around [indiscernible] quickly. And I would say that there is a battle for growers\u2019 attention in that marketplace. Clearly, there is an attempt to ensure that there is penetration of those technologies and gaining rapid adoption. And the other thing we dealt with, both on corn and soybeans this year, is that prices were set and released to farmers in advance of when we had the significant run-up in commodity prices. So I think prices were set fairly from where we sat in terms of that period point in time when we released prices. But clearly, we had this dramatic run-up in the fourth quarter and here into the first quarter as well. So as you think on a more global basis, we\u2019re looking aggressively at our situation in the second half of the year, where we\u2019re currently pricing and re-pricing some of our products. And we\u2019re going to factor in those points that I made around market conditions, our cost considerations, and clearly, that product value is at the foundation of it. So \u2013 but it\u2019s been, I think, consistent with our expectations, but obviously, it\u2019s a little confusing because of the near-term run-up we\u2019ve had in commodity prices, that\u2019s different from when we release pricing. Jim Collins : Thanks, Tim. And P.J., I know you were focused on North America. But also in the quarter, if you look at Latin America pricing, we were up 14%. And in the quarter, crop protection pricing was up 6%. So as I said, we\u2019ve installed that methodology and that thinking now in the organization, and we\u2019re going to continue to keep the focus there. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Silke Kueck from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jim Collins : Good morning. Operator : Please ensure your mute function is turned off. Silke Kueck : Hi. Good morning. Sorry about that. Jim Collins : It\u2019s okay. Silke Kueck : Hi. Good morning. I have two questions. What is behind Europe \u2013 what was behind like the flat seed outlook for the first half of the year? Is that correct? Does that have to do with the competition in the market you are seeing? And I was wondering whether you can talk about the planting estimates and whether you think that those are relatively conservative. Some of the ag retailers have already thought that, probably like corn acres should be 2 million acres higher versus those initial estimates, and soybean acres might be higher by another 2 million acres. So I was wondering if you can comment on that? And my second question is about the negative mix in seeds that you alluded to. Is the negative mix a function of you\u2019re selling more a Brevant seed versus Pioneer or is it a function of your technologies being offered on somebody else\u2019s germplasm, like for Enlist for example rather than your own? Thank you. Jim Collins : Yes, great. So on the half, what you\u2019re seeing overall, you can see strong start in first quarter, and that was led off by the finish to Latin America and an early start to Europe. As we put that on a first half basis, really, what\u2019s happening there is you\u2019re right, we\u2019re going to grow in North America where we\u2019re seeing acres return in soybeans and strong, kind of, flattish acres in corn. But we\u2019re going to be down overall in Europe on some \u2013 mostly supply constraints in corn. So on balance, it\u2019s about flat. Now, on volumes, now you\u2019ve mentioned the USDA outlook, and we\u2019re watching that very, very carefully. And with our route-to-market approach and kind of that real tight connection right to the acre, we feel like we\u2019ve put ourselves in a really good spot, that if we do see some acres come back into this market, we\u2019re well positioned to capitalize on that. In terms of price and mix, it\u2019s just the flow-through of the different products. In first quarter, the heavy flow-through of the Pioneer brand is really ahead of us in 2Q. So in first quarter, you\u2019re kind of seeing some of that other route to market, other channel brands that are flowing through, as well as the effect of both the European and Latin America flow through. So I don\u2019t know if, Tim, anything else or Dave, anything else you have to add? Tim Glenn : I think the question around acres, just a point Jim made, I mean clearly, we\u2019re working closely with customers. We\u2019re in a, I\u2019d say, a fairly favorable planting environment right now. You look at the corn progress report this week, and we\u2019re roughly 10 percentage points above the 5-year average for planet corn area. And that opens the door for farmers to plant more corn. Now at the end of the day, it\u2019s an individual decision, and farmers are going to make that on a field-by-field basis. And so I think it\u2019s fair to say your point around more total corn and soybean acres being planted. I think we would agree with that and probably more consistent with what our original guide was for the year, somewhere in the 180 million to 182 million combined acres on corn and soybeans. It\u2019s hard to make the call specifically on how much it\u2019s going to go to corn or soybeans because it is such an individual decision. But the window is open. And as farmers make great progress planning this crop, then it clearly creates an opportunity for a little bit more corn to be planted in places. So we\u2019re working closely with our customers to make sure we\u2019re there to provide the needed products. Jim Collins : Right. So overall, I\u2019d say we\u2019re pretty excited about this market backdrop that Tim just talked about and you mentioned acres wise. And we don\u2019t believe this is just a 2021 thing. We think as we start to set up for 2022, we can have a couple of good years here from an acre and supply constraints that we\u2019re seeing globally. And it\u2019s the right kind of problem to have. It\u2019s just really strong grain demand out there accruing those opportunities. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jim Collins : Hi, Kevin. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Corey on for Kevin. Dave, welcome. Question about capital deployment, now that you\u2019re nearing the end of the share repurchase program, which, I believe, completing in the first half would put you about a year ahead of schedule. Can you update us on thoughts regarding deployment of excess capital through additional repurchases or M&A after the completion of this program? Dave Anderson : Sure. Well, it\u2019s a really good point. Jim mentioned the $450 million in the quarter, approximately returned to shareholders. That\u2019s obviously a foundational item for us when we think about capital deployment, Corey, as you know. And as you say, we\u2019re on track probably to complete the majority of our outstanding share buyback through the first half, certainly through the first three quarters of the year. So timing there will be sort of to be determined. But it really does open up the good point that given the cash generation of the company is the opportunity to continue to deliver value back to shareholders, not only in terms of the operational performance and excellence of the company, but also through our ongoing dividend as well as the share buyback program. We\u2019re going to be talking more about that later in the year. We\u2019re going to have more visibility as we complete the first half. We will have more transparency too around \u2013 for us internally, around the outlook for working capital, some of the other key components for the full year. So we will come back to you and update you at that time. But it\u2019s a very good question because the things you\u2019re talking about are foundational in terms of how we\u2019re thinking about the company, and we\u2019re thinking about capital employment. Hopefully, that helps. Jim Collins : Thanks, Corey. Dave Anderson : Thanks, Corey. Operator : We will now take our next question from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Steve Byrne : Yes. So it sounds like the rally and corn that we\u2019ve seen in the last few months is probably benefiting your crop chemical sales more than seeds, given your seed orders were locked in and effectively priced in the fall. But can you comment a little bit about how the ag outlook has rallied in the last few months, has affected your outlook for the next crop in 2022. Where do you think you have the most meaningful impacts on either price/mix or market share gains? And also, I just wanted to find out whether or not any of these logistical issues that you highlighted may have prevented some seed deliveries in the second quarter. I heard a little bit of that from some retailer contacts that seed orders were really, really delayed. And whether any of them might have been too late, and that could have led to an order change? Jim Collins : Yes. Thanks, Steve, for the question. Clearly, a strong market backdrop, good commodity prices, net farm income levels, where they are, provides opportunities for a grower to make an investment in their crop, whether it\u2019s continue to purchase really, really strong high-performance seed, but also to make that investment in a strong Crop Protection program. And there is no doubt that as we come into this season here in 2021, the investments that growers are making in, we control, is really showing up. And it\u2019s maybe not as much in the corn herbicide market, but we\u2019re really just feeling in the soybean herbicide. And we\u2019re leading that charge with Enlist. Our business in North America for herbicides organically growth-wise revenue price volume was up 32% in the first quarter over last year. So you can really see that momentum. And we\u2019re feeling that in other places around the world. So as we start to shape up for 2022, we\u2019re going to be there with a strong lineup of crop protection products. And the overall market backdrop will give us that opportunity to, as Tim said, consider all of those factors as we think through our pricing strategy for this next year. In terms of the supply perspective, we really only had one small issue globally, and that\u2019s been in Europe. And it\u2019s just been related to some production constraints that we felt this past year. There were parts of Europe that had some real weather-related issues. It\u2019s not just a Corteva thing. There are other folks in the industry that are feeling that similar pressure. And by and large, I think we\u2019ve kind of worked our way through it now, and we\u2019ve put ourselves in a position going into \u201822 to have the supplies that it\u2019s going to take. So \u2013 anyway, finishing off on pricing for a moment. I think the best answer to that is you just got to look back at our track record and what we\u2019ve accomplished over the years. And we\u2019ve done \u2013 we\u2019ve accomplished that track record in some pretty tough markets. And as markets start to improve, we\u2019re going to continue to drive that, going forward. Thanks, Steve. Operator : We will now take our next question from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a strong start here. I guess, I just wanted to go to the cost side. You guys unveiled some strong programs last year. And as you noted, now that the productivity or costs have increased, you are looking at a $50 million headwind. You also had some temp costs last year. So could you just describe how much of those costs potentially come back this year and maybe the opportunities to make some more of those structural moving forward? Is there a potential \u2013 or potential walk to maybe low 20 on EBITDA margin over the next, say, several years? And if so, what would be some of the areas that you target to increase productivity? Thanks. Jim Collins : Thanks, Arun. Clearly, we have built a discipline and a set of processes around driving productivity kind of year in and year out. And so you\u2019re right, this year we\u2019ve talked about $250 million of productivity programs. A lot of those aimed in our manufacturing and cost of manufacturing organization. But we will continue to have productivity focus in other areas of the business. One of the areas where our costs have trended down nicely has been related to this whole pandemic and COVID, and the fact that we have areas of the business where we\u2019re being just really efficient with the investments that we\u2019re making. And we would expect a little of that cost to come back this year. Our stance, we\u2019re pretty much trying to maintain that very kind of tight focused stance. And it\u2019s a little early, but as we start to think about 2022 in North America, we will start to return to a more normal, kind of, stance in terms of people and work and a little bit more travel maybe and a little bit more from a focus on investments there. But I\u2019m committed, and Dave and I have talked a lot about this, about finding additional productivity programs. So we don\u2019t let those costs creep back in. So Dave, what else would you share? Dave Anderson : I would just say, too, it\u2019s a really good question because it\u2019s one that\u2019s not surprising a topic for our leadership team, and particularly as we look at the strength of the first quarter, what we\u2019re delivering, I mentioned the positive in terms of the SG&A expense that we have. And we look at that on both, obviously, a nominal basis and also net of inflation in terms of performance that we\u2019re delivering. The key thing is, in addition to productivity, we\u2019ve also, as you know, invested behind some restructuring. And a lot of that benefit is going to flow through in future periods. So we\u2019ve got some things that are in the stream, if you will, that are active, that are also going to benefit us going forward. But as Jim said, this isn\u2019t just \u2013 this isn\u2019t a static process, a very, very dynamic process. We\u2019re going to continue to look at how do we continue to replenish this portfolio of programs and projects. And that\u2019s a big part of delivering in terms of our forward plan. Jim Collins : And on the second half of your question around EBITDA margin improvement going forward, 2021 is a first really good installment there. By the end of the year, we will have added 200 basis points to our EBITDA margin. And the trajectory that we\u2019re on, as we\u2019ve talked about before, is to continue to drive EBITDA towards those midterm growth targets that we laid out. And you\u2019ll continue to see those EBITDA margins climb. Operator : We will now take our final question from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Hi. Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Jim Collins : HI, Adam. Adam Samuelson : Hi. Maybe a question for Dave Anderson and just thinking about maybe your early reflections on the capital structure, and the way Corteva manages the very significant working capital seasonality, the cash balance associated with that. And then just given your kind of prior and very successful career at Honeywell, managing significant legacy liabilities, any thoughts on opportunities that \u2013 to do anything with the pension to maybe relieve that burden from a liability perspective? Dave Anderson : Yes. It\u2019s a really good question. Again, it\u2019s against the backdrop of the strength of our operating performance and our cash flow outlook, that multiyear guidance that we\u2019ve given in terms of cumulative cash from operations through 2022. So that really does provide us the foundation, as I mentioned earlier, that provides us the foundation in terms of flexibility, going forward. I think it\u2019s a really, really timely question given that. And it\u2019s one that Jim and I have talked about. We will have, obviously, the opportunity to do deeper analysis, working with not only the finance team, but others in the organization, sharing some thoughts with the board, coming back and later in the year, probably sharing more thoughts also with investors. So that\u2019s something I would say is very much on our minds. I would say right now, the thing that we\u2019re really focused on is just continuing to execute operationally, deliver the margin expansion and deliver, obviously, the cash flow for the year. And continue to reward shareholders, not only through our operating performance, but also through our ongoing dividend and our share buyback program. And then that gives us optionality. And I think that\u2019s a plus I would say we look forward to giving you updates on that as we go forward. And I would put pension into that category. And you\u2019re right I have had a fair amount of experience in that. It\u2019s just something you do over the course of your career. So it\u2019s one of the things that I\u2019ll be working to with the team around in terms of options that we have there. Thanks for the question. Jim Collins : Yes. Thanks, Adam. Jim Collins : Excellent. Well, we thank you all for joining the call today and really appreciate your interest in Corteva. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Collins : Thanks, Jeff, and welcome to the participants joining the call today. Starting on Slide 4. We launched Corteva with a strategy grounded in building and delivering value to shareholders through new product innovation that drives organic growth and margin improvement, organizational efficiency and rigor and disciplined capital allocation. As I speak to you today, I'm happy to say this strategy is working. Now that's a testament to the extraordinary efforts by our more than 20,000 colleagues worldwide over the last 5 years, beginning with the announcement of the intent to create Corteva. At its core, this team is focused on 1 thing, delivering. Time after time, they have demonstrated tremendous resilience and adaptability by pushing forward to bring our purpose to life, advance our strategy and deliver our near-term business results, no matter the circumstances. So to them, I say thank you, as I could not be prouder of their relentless focus. Our first half performance is yet another solid proof point of our progress, with 6% organic growth and 17% operating EBITDA improvement compared to the prior year. In Crop Protection, we continue to build on our new product momentum and now expect we will deliver $400 million in sales growth for this part of the portfolio for the year, up from our prior estimate of $300 million, a direct result of successfully advancing our pipeline. In fact, through June of this year we have received nearly 90 additional new product registrations for our Crop Protection portfolio.  Market fundamentals remain positive as growers look to best-in-class solutions to drive productivity and capitalize on what likely will be a record year for income levels in key markets such as the U.S. and Brazil. This helped drive pricing in Seed, specifically 3% increases in corn globally as well as further penetration of the Enlist soybean system for the 2021, now estimated to be on approximately 35% of U.S. soybean acres and that\u2019s up from prior estimates of 30%. Execution is sound and we are carrying substantial momentum. As a result, we are raising our guidance for full year. We now expect to deliver between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion in operating EBITDA for the full year 2021, representing a 22% growth over the prior year at the midpoint. Importantly, we also expect to maintain the operating leverage we delivered through the first half, with an impressive 200 basis point increase in margins for the full year on the organization's continued agility in the face of ongoing supply chain volatility and cost inflation, which brings us back to value creation. In addition to strong earnings growth, we are also advancing our commitments on returning cash to shareholders. Specifically, Corteva returned approximately $750 million in cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases through the first half. And we recently announced a dividend increase of 7.7% and a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program. In total, we expect to return more than $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases by the end of 2021. The bottom line, we are executing on what we said we would do. We are delivering operating leverage. And we are intently focused on advancing our strategy to deliver value for all of our shareholders. So looking at Slide 5, which has our financial results for the quarter and the first half. So quickly touching on the quarter. We delivered 6% organic growth on gains in both segments, led by North America and Latin America. This translated into earnings growth of 18% and margin improvement of more than 200 basis points, another solid quarter of continued growth and margin improvement. Now focusing on the half. Sales gains were led by execution of our new product pipeline, where new Crop Protection products delivered $260 million in sales growth over the prior year. Additionally, Seed sales improved on increased planted area in U.S. soybeans and strong demand for corn in Latin America. We continued to deliver on our price for value strategy as global corn prices improved 3% for the half. Now Dave is going to provide you much more detail on the earnings growth drivers for the half, but it's important to note the impressive level of margin improvement that we have delivered so far this year. Through the half, we drove nearly 200 basis points of margin improvement compared to the prior year on price and volume gains across the portfolio, despite continued challenges on cost inflation that we and many others across various industries continue to face. Again, this first half performance is yet another important proof point that our value creation strategy is working, further reinforcing our updated guidance for the full year. So shifting to the market backdrop on Slide 6. Fundamentals remain strong despite volatility in the commodity markets. We believe global demand will ultimately drive growth into 2022 and beyond as local economies recover from the pandemic-related shutdowns. We're monitoring the impacts of the pandemic globally. And we'll remain agile to ensure we continue to support our employees, our customers and our local communities. Now while the U.S. market remains attractive as we look to the near-term outlook, we see strong demand for best-in-class technologies in markets outside of the U.S. Take Brazil, for example, where demand for grain is leading to increased planted area and rising commodity prices. With our market-leading position for corn and one of the best new Crop Protection lineups, we are in a strong position to capitalize on above-market growth. While commodity prices will continue to react to short-term events in the industry, it's important to remember that the global diversity of our business is what provides an attractive outlook for growth. Together with sustained growth in global ag markets, led by robust global demand, we are pleased with the acceleration and opportunities to deliver value to our customers in these local markets through our best-in-class products and advantaged routes to market. Turning to Slide 7. I'll provide more detail on the balance and the diversity of our sales growth across the globe and provide further proof points for the half. In North America, organic sales were up 4% for the half. Seed sales benefited from increased planted area for both corn and soybeans, coupled with continued penetration of the Enlist E3 soybeans. As I mentioned, we now expect Enlist to represent about 35% of the U.S. soybean market in 2021, and that's up from our previous expectation of 30%. On seed pricing for the first half, competitive pressures in the soybean market was aligned with our prior expectations, with pricing down 2%. Corn price in the Pioneer brand was up about 1 point compared to the prior year. North America Crop Protection had a strong first half with 10% organic growth, on continued demand for new technologies, including Enlist herbicide and solid pricing execution in response to rising raw material, freight and logistics costs. Fungicide growth was also a highlight, up double-digits, as growers look to take preventative measures to maximize yields. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, organic sales grew 5% on strong pricing execution and record sunflower seed volumes. This growth was muted by an approximate $80 million to $100 million sales impact from corn supply shortages. In Crop Protection, our portfolio of new and differentiated products remain in high demand, including technologies such as Arylex herbicide and Zorvec fungicide, which enabled us to drive price and volume gains and gain market share in Europe despite the impact of product phaseouts. In Latin America, we delivered 23% organic sales growth on strong volumes and execution on our price for value strategy. In Seed, volumes grew 20% on share gains in the Brazil Safrinha and earlier shipments for the Brazil summer season. In Crop Protection, volumes grew 9% on significant demand for new and differentiated technologies such as Isoclast and Jemvelva insecticides. Pricing actions reflected strong product demand and helped to more than offset unfavorable currency impacts from the Brazilian real. In Asia Pacific, we realized 3% organic sales growth compared to the prior year on both volume and price improvements. Seed volumes were down, largely due to COVID-related demand impacts, primarily in Southeast Asia and India. Crop Protection organic growth of 11% was led by further penetration of our new products, including Rinskor herbicide and Pyraxalt insecticide. So Dave will now provide more detail on our first half performance and our upgraded expectations for the rest of the year. Dave? Dave Anderson : Thanks, Jim, and welcome everyone to the call.  Let's move to Slide 8 for a detailed review of our operating EBITDA performance for the year -- or for the first half. You'll see that for the first half 2021, operating EBITDA grew $335 million versus the prior year to nearly $2.4 billion, a clear indication of how well we've executed in the first half and a reflection of our ability to capitalize on robust demand for our products. Driving the increased operating EBITDA were strong price and volume, with combined benefits of approximately $340 million. This came from focused commercial execution and penetration of new and differentiated products across all regions.  To illustrate this, sales of new Crop Protection products grew over $260 million versus the prior year. And at the same time, we delivered nearly 30% of organic seed growth in Latin America, driven by strong corn sales in Brazil. And finally, we continue to extract value for our yield advantage technology; and as Jim said, global corn pricing up 3% during the half. Costs were about a $60 million net headwind to operating EBITDA for the half. This includes delivery of approximately $175 million from productivity initiatives, including the ongoing benefit from asset footprint rationalization and other cost improvements. This helped to partially offset $240 million of cost headwinds in the half, which are primarily market-driven. And we continue to operate in an environment marked with challenged supply chains and cost inflation.  In the first half, we experienced higher freight and logistics costs as global trade markets saw shipping demand outpace supply. Additionally, prices of certain active ingredients and intermediates continue to rise compared to the same period last year, including glyphosate. Now we continue to take action to mitigate these impacts where possible, including passing through certain inflationary costs for our Seed and Crop Protection products and delivering against our productivity initiatives. As evidence of our disciplined focused execution, we delivered more than 190 basis points of margin expansion in the half. It's notable in terms of the agile operations team delivering strong performance. Let's go now to Slide 9 to cover a few highlights from the Crop Protection segment for the half, where organic sales grew 10%, which included a 4% headwind from the strategic decision to phase out certain low-margin products, primarily in insecticides. Again, strong demand for our new technology led to sales gains, including an increase of more than $260 million in new product sales when compared to the same period last year. Herbicides were up 13% compared to the first half of 2020, led by continued penetration of Arylex and Enlist. Fungicides grew 26%, driven by strong demand for Zorvec and Inatreq, primarily in Europe, Middle East and Africa. And lastly, insecticides grew 3% in the half, which included a 16% negative impact from discontinued products. Growth was largely driven by our differentiated Spinosyns technology, including Jemvelva and Qalcova actives, which were up 14% in the half. Favorable product mix and strategic price increases drove pricing gains in all regions for the half, led by a 9% improvement in Latin America and a 3% price improvement in North America. Operating EBITDA for Crop Protection grew 26% from the prior year, driven by strong demand for new products and pricing execution. We did experience cost headwinds of approximately $130 million for this segment during the period. Overall, the headwinds more than offset our productivity actions. In most cases, we see these higher costs representing a new baseline, which will continue to work to mitigate by taking pricing actions where possible and delivering ongoing productivity. Now despite these challenges, we drove over 220 basis points of operating EBITDA margin improvement in Crop Protection in the half. Very impressive performance. Let's go to then Slide 10 and talk about the Seed highlights. You can see on Slide 10, organic sales for Seed were up 4%, driven by solid pricing, coupled with market share gains in Brazil Safrinha, demand-driven earlier shipments for Brazil summer season and also volume growth in North America on increased planted area aligned with USDA estimates. On pricing, we maintained our track record in extracting value for our yield advantage technology, with corn prices up 3% compared to prior year, led by double-digit price improvement in Latin America. Soybean volumes were up 7% for the half, led by an approximately 5% increase in U.S. planted area. Soybean pricing was down 2%, consistent with our expectations, as we continue to see competitive pressure in the U.S. market. Other oilseeds were up 21% versus the first half of 2020, reflecting record sunflower volumes in Europe and also higher canola volumes in Canada. Operating EBITDA for this segment improved 13% on strong price execution globally, ongoing cost and productivity actions, lower royalties and bad debt and a favorable impact from currency. And while we experienced higher input costs, the teams continue to manage through these headwinds, and we're able to deliver operating EBITDA margin improvement of over 200 basis points for the segment for the half. So now let's go to Slide 11 and talk about our full year 2021 guidance. You can see there that for the remainder of the year and our updated expectations for the full year, and with the backdrop of the strong performance for the first half, we're raising our reported net sales guidance to be in the range of $15.2 billion to $15.4 billion, representing 8% growth at the midpoint, which includes an approximately 2% tailwind from currency. We're also raising our operating EBITDA guide, and now expect to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, representing 22% growth at the midpoint. This increase reflects continued strong demand for our new products globally in both Crop Protection and Seed, coupled with strong price execution in key regions on technology and also improved currency. Specific to the second half, we expect price to largely offset cost headwinds, which are notably Seed-driven. And as a result, volume, primarily in Latin America Crop Protection, is driving second half earnings growth. Now the volatility of exchange rates will continue to be a key variable we're watching, notably the Brazilian real, where we assumed a rate of 5.25 for the back half of the year. In Crop Protection, we anticipate $400 million of year-over-year improvement in sales from our new products, $100 million more than we originally estimated. The additional growth is a testament to strong demand that we're seeing globally for our best-in-class technology. As we think about costs, the current inflationary environment is expected to continue through at least the end of the year. As a result, we now expect a net cost headwind of approximately $125 million for the full year 2021. This represents about $75 million in additional cost inflation from our previous estimate. It's driven by higher input costs as well as freight and logistics. Now we're actively monitoring supply chain pressures in the market, and the operational teams remain agile in meeting customer demand. As it relates to SG&A, the organization continues to maintain disciplined spending. And we anticipate that as a percent of revenue, SG&A is expected to improve by approximately 50 basis points for the year despite higher commissions and also variable compensation. Taken together, it's an impressive improvement and impressive outlook and really highlights the strong focus by the full organization to execute on our strategy. Going now to Slide 12 with a few comments on cash flow. I'll give you a view on our 2021 cash flow expectations. We now believe cash from operations will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion for the year. It reflects both increased earnings, but also the investment we're making in working capital to support growth. The organization continues to focus on cash cycle time. It's working. As a result, we're targeting improvement in net working capital turns for the full year. We're increasing our CapEx spending target from $550 million to between $600 million and $650 million for 2021. The increase allows us to fund projects with high return on investment to support growth. And it follows a complete midyear review that we completed of all of our capital programs. We've experienced an improvement in the funded status of the U.S. pension plan year-to-date, driven by both asset returns and discount rate. The improvement provides increased probability, there will be no required contributions to the plan in '21 or 2022. Finally, as Jim stated, we're committed to the return of cash to shareholders as evidenced by more than $1.2 billion we expect to return via dividends and share repurchases by the end of the year, which includes expected progress on the new $1.5 billion program that we recently announced. Now if you move to Slide 13, I just want to give you some early insights on our planning process and thinking as we start to frame out 2022. Importantly, carrying forward our momentum from 2021, we expect to see organic growth globally. This will largely be driven by execution and further penetration of new and differentiated products across all regions, reflecting the strength of our portfolio and our pipeline, which are expected to drive increases in both volume and price in 2022. For example, we continue to remain excited about the growth opportunities for Spinosyns, which we believe will approach sales of $1 billion in 2022. We expect seed pricing to be additive to earnings when netted with the impact of higher cost of goods sold as a result of higher commodity costs. And with our transition to Enlist, we expect royalty improvement for 2022 as part of our journey towards royalty neutrality by the end of the decade. Royalty reduction is anticipated to be more significant in '23 and '24, but next year will be an important next step on continuing net royalty improvement. And lastly, we remain focused on delivering against productivity as input costs continue to evolve with the current market environment. So to manage this pressure, we're going to continue to drive execution on productivity initiatives, which are expected to partially offset any increased costs. And this is just our preliminary take on the setup for next year. We're going to share more details later this year. But certainly, we view 2022 as a solid opportunity for earnings and margin growth as we execute our strategy and we leverage our global footprint and our diversified portfolio. So before turning it back to Jim, let me just do a quick summary, focus on both our 2021 delivery and the setup for 2022. This year is characterized by first half operating EBITDA margin improvement of nearly 200 basis points and full year margin expectations also improve by approximately 200 basis points. And that setup for 2022 is positive. We're driving growth in all regions, across a strengthening portfolio and delivering solid operating leverage. And with that, let me turn it back to Jim. Jim Collins : Thanks, Dave, and that's a great summary. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to share a few final comments. Through our heads-down focused execution by an incredible global team, we've gotten through one of the toughest periods in the history of our industry. We emerged on the other side even better positioned to serve farmers and ensure the security of the global food supply and to deliver value for our shareholders. With our distinct competitive advantages, Corteva is positioned for long-term sustainable growth in a rapidly changing global agriculture marketplace. Now when I say sustainable, I refer to both Corteva's long-term growth and the way we will deliver it. As consumer preferences and environmental challenges change, farmers will need to adapt. And Corteva will be at the center of that relationship, deploying our knowledge, market presence and industry-leading capabilities to assure the sustainable future of global agriculture by helping growers deliver more while using fewer resources. Our knowledge of farmers' needs comes from the relationship that we have built over decades through our advantaged route to market, which helps drive our grower-focused innovation. Now this is clearly showing up in our new product sales quarter after quarter and will continue to be one of our top priorities moving forward. And importantly, we have a number of exciting products that continue to progress through our pipeline in both segments. So finally, our first half performance and updated guidance for the year clearly demonstrates that all of the elements of our strategy that we built are working. Our team is advancing our purpose, driving a culture focused on our customers, delivering on our commitments through focused execution, building momentum on long-term value creation, and most importantly, growing progress for all of our stakeholders for years to come. So with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff. Jeff Rudolph : Thank you, Jim. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Joel Jackson : I appreciate the early look at 2022. You seem to have a comment in the slide deck that reiterating that you're on track with your midterm targets of 12% to 16% EBITDA CAGR between 2019 and 2022. That imply -- I wanted to just understand if that's true. And that implies EBITDA range next year of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion. Can you just maybe comment as much as you can if that's true that you are comfortable that you will be in that range next year? Jim Collins : Great. Joel, thanks for the question. And you're right. Our initial views on 2022 are, it's going to just be another great opportunity to continue to drive some really solid both top and bottom line growth. We think against what will be a really constructive market backdrop. The market could grow next year somewhere between 3% and 3.5%. And so we're carrying some fantastic momentum. And when you look at first half results, you look at the setup and the revised guide for the second half of the year, and we just believe we'll be carrying some really good momentum. That growth also, just to highlight, if you think about it, is very broad-based, right? We're leveraging a diverse footprint globally from a geographic perspective. But we're also leveraging a very diverse portfolio. And that's coming from the new product pipeline, but it's also coming from just great execution out there. So as we continue to not only drive productivity that will be constructive to margin expansion and also taking a really solid look at pricing going into 2022, I think when I step back, it's going to be very solid. And I believe it will be an opportunity for us to deliver above that market growth. That will be an opportunity for us to continue to deliver that margin expansion that you've seen. And then that entire framework then, Joel, if you step back from it, it really does align very nicely with those midterm target expectations that you and I have talked about before. So without going to a specific number, I believe we're well lined up here and that framework is right on track with those midterm expectations. Operator : And we'll move on to Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Maybe you could give us some early insight. I know your price cards are probably coming out later this month or so. If we look at sort of the pricing achievement that you had in the second quarter for South America in Seed, 10%-ish, is that a good proxy for how we should think about North American pricing for next year? Or do you think it could be better than that or will be a little bit less than that? Jim Collins : Yes. Great. Vincent, thanks. Thanks for the question. As we've talked about this a number of times before, there are a bunch of variables that go into how we think about seed cost as we go into the season, obviously, into our pricing model. First is yield. How we do in seed production around our yield factor, the quality of what comes out of our seed production fields and how much discard that we have as we spread that cost over a fewer units. Growers lock in at the market quote that they lock in at on all of those seed production fields, and they have a 12-month window to do that. So that factor adjusts and change as we kind of go through all of that. So we're sitting here today with some assumptions around average commodity prices and yield and quality. So if I put all of our current assumptions today into our model, we would estimate that our Seed cost of goods in North America could increase in a range of somewhere between $175 million to $225 million. Now this can change. It's still early. We still got a seed crop that's maturing out there and it's based on our assumptions today. So we have -- we feel like we now have a pretty good estimate of what to expect the flow-through in cost of goods will be. So with that said, then as you've asked, pricing is obviously our biggest lever to really help manage and cover that increase in costs. And so I won't comment specifically on what our price cards are going to be. We're still finalizing those details. Our plans, as you suggested, are to release those cards later this summer, consistent with our normal timing approach there. But the way I think about it, rather than specifically talking about cards, I think about it overall in terms of earnings. And so at this point, I'd anticipate that by -- for 2022, that our Seed pricing approach, net of all of those cost of goods increases that I just mentioned, would be incremental to EBITDA for that market. So at the end of the day, Vincent, what you have to do is look at our track record, right? The track record that we've delivered in 2020, the track record you're seeing now through this year. And we're building momentum. So just pricing this year through the first half of 3% global seed shows you that we've got the team focused on that and we're going to continue to drive that momentum. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And just as a follow-up, do you think this was the last year of sort of the soybean price competition in North America and that could turn positive next year? Or is there still some tussling to do out there? Jim Collins : Yes. It's always a really competitive market in that space. And clearly, we have a big technology transition going on. But maybe I'll ask Tim to say a few words about the soybean competition. Tim? Tim Glenn : Yes, Vincent, I think, as Jim said, we're in the middle of a technology shift out there. We've seen the penetration that Enlist has made in the marketplace. And obviously, there's new competitive products that are coming into the market as well. And so clearly, that has -- there's been companies that have been competing for the attention of growers in terms of penetration pricing to try to get -- drive technology adoption. And we've seen that for the past couple of years. It's hard to predict where we'll be going into 2022. I would -- I go into the attitude that every year is competitive, but you're competing more on value versus price. And as we think about the soybean market, clearly, we're going to focus on the value that we're delivering, our position relative to the competition and work closely with our customers for them to understand the value of our product as well as the value of the service that we're providing. We've been able to position the Enlist system very well with our customers. And they are driving tremendous value, not just from the Seed, but also the Crop Protection system that goes along with it. So I feel good about our value proposition. And I'm optimistic that that the value that we're delivering will be recognized in the marketplace. And clearly, as Jim said, we've got a strong process in place around implementation, administration of pricing that we're going to continue to follow. Jim Collins : Yes. And Vincent, I'd just add, when I kind of summarize that and I talk about pricing approach in Seed being earnings positive, I'm kind of all-inclusive there, corn and beans. So just -- it's kind of just the full package. So while we might pushed in some areas, we'll have some opportunities in others. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Two-part question for you on the price cost spread. I guess the first part would be, with regard to the incremental cost pressure that you referenced, how much of that is occurring in Crop Protection versus Seeds? And then the second part would be, on the Crop Protection side, what is your outlook for pricing? You used the word agile a few times in describing the disposition. Maybe you could talk through where you're more confident or less confident in obtaining price, by region or product line, and how we should be? Jim Collins : Great, Kevin. So some of the numbers that I was talking about a minute ago answering Vincent's question were really focused kind of on Seed cost of sales flow-through. So we do have Crop Protection costs. And maybe I'll ask between Dave or Rajan to say a few words about the work that we're doing there as well. But you've seen good pricing already this year through the first half that's allowed us to go capture price to cover the raw material flow-through. And again, I'll have Dave share some of the specific numbers. And I think you just have to look at that momentum here in 2021 and that track record and know that we're going to continue to be aggressive as we go into '22 and beyond about how we think about that. So Dave, do you want to talk about? Dave Anderson : Yes. Maybe I can just talk a little bit about -- Jim, about some of the market headwinds. Just Kevin, give you a little bit of color there. And specifically, I think one of the things you asked was in terms of the increment of $75 million, where we're seeing that, that's largely in Seed -- kind of breaks down $50 million in Seed, $25 million in Crop Protection. And if you look at it sort of overall, what we're seeing is a lot of that is freight and logistics. So if you look at it sort of by element, it's freight and logistics. And then you get into the Seed yield and commodity costs next, glyphosate and actually a little bit of a break in the updated numbers in terms of precious metals, just because of the actions we've taken operationally with precious metals and the use of palladium. So I think we've got a good handle on it. And we -- I think, really credit to the teams in terms of looking at early indicators and being on top of this. And we think that really -- I mean, from my perspective, coming into the organization, I think it's one of the things that's actually quite impressive when you look at the results against that as a backdrop. Maybe, Rajan, you want to talk a little bit about the other piece of Kevin's question? Rajan Gajaria : Yes. Kevin, just to talk about CP pricing, talk about what Jim mentioned, the track record. Let's start with pricing for Crop Protection for the first half year. We had a significant price increase, 4%. And to give example, when you look at a product like Spinosyn, this is our differentiated product, we actually were high single-digit on pricing there. So when we look at our portfolio, the more we shift towards new and differentiated products, we've got around $400 million of growth this year, as Jim mentioned. We continue to see the momentum. That gives us commercial organization and opportunity to make sure that those products can get the value back. And that is consistent with our philosophy across both Seeds and Crop Protection. So have confidence on the productivity that was referred to by Dave. But I would say that our pricing philosophy continues to be strong. And we are delivering strong results in the first half, and we see that continuing next year, too. Operator : And we have a question from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. P.J. Juvekar: It was interesting to hear about your royalty reduction comments, that begins next year. Can you talk about the bigger impact that happens in 2023 and 2024 in terms of your royalty reduction as well as some royalty income from in-licensing? And then why does it take until the end of the decade to become royalty neutral? Jim Collins : Great, P.J. Thanks for the question. And you're right. You're really -- we're starting to see now that flow-through of royalty expense reduction. Through the first half of 2021, royalty expense decreased somewhere between $40 million and $50 million compared to last year. And I'll just point to a couple of messages there. First, this was broad-based. It's across our whole portfolio of corn and soybeans. And that's a really good step. It represents really good progress against that royalty reduction commitment that we've talked about before. As you start to think about how that begins then to roll off over the decade, we've talked before about the effect of the Enlist roll-off. And that will really get you about half of that reduction towards that royalty neutrality that we've shared many times before. So by the middle of the decade -- and that's just directly tied to the ramp-up of the Enlist system as we back-down on Roundup Ready to expand and really start to drive not only the ramp of units of Enlist but also the ramp of the proprietary nature of those units as well.  The second half of this decade that we\u2019ve talked about before where you really get that second tranche is really more related to royalty income that is offsetting a residual number of expenses that we're still going to continue to have. We'll still have a few traits that we'll be licensing in. So we offset that. And it takes a little while, right? When you license a trait to a third-party, it takes them a while to do their own breeding and integrates the trait into their germ plasm. Then it takes them a little while to begin ramping those units. And so those royalty incomes, they come in based on units sold, not units breed or units licensed. So it just takes a little while for that to spool up. And then that, that just becomes a continued long-term margin opportunity kind of through the remainder of the decade as we get through that ramp-up on the first phase of that as Enlist. P.J. Juvekar: And just a quick question on FX. I was looking at your exchange gains and losses table. And a net loss of $15 million, would you consider that reasonable given the size of your company? I know you had a new FX strategy. So how much of your orders are for the upcoming Latin American season are hedged? Just talk a little bit about just sort of the new strategy and how is it working now. Dave Anderson : Sure. Yes, P.J. Let me just give you a kind of a summary there. We're essentially 100% hedged for the second half of this year. We've got some EBITDA exposure even with the hedge. We're assuming, I think I mentioned in my remarks, 5.25 is the BRL, is the real assumption for the second half. And basically, we're hedged at around 5.50. So there's a little bit of exposure between the 5.25 and the 5.50. But really, we think, very manageable in the context of the balanced outlook that we've given you for the full year. Certainly, one of the considerations. But it's -- we take a sophisticated best-in-class capability and approach that we're taking in terms of that exposure. So thanks for the question. Operator : And we have a question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Jim and Dave, just on the productivity savings. Looking at next year, should they be equal to above what you're realizing this year, which is, I guess, roughly $200 million? Jim Collins : Yes, Dave. If you look at this year first, we're on track to deliver the $250 million in productivity savings. And those are really helping us offset many of those market-driven cost headwinds that we've been talking about. And our productivity strategy is to continue that momentum as we go into 2022, and we do have a fairly robust pipeline of initiatives. In Crop Protection, we're going to continue the focus on footprint rationalizations that we've had out there. We're down some 9 manufacturing assets globally. And these are large units that take some time to work through supply chain implications and reset those. So we have a few more of those still to go. Those will begin -- those will continue to show up in '22. We're working much more deeply now into the procurement space. As Dave has come in, he's brought some real great insights around our buy and working through understanding how we source intermediates, how we source our direct and our indirect spends. We've got some work we can do next year on SKU rationalization as we can continue to focus now our portfolio and our pipeline on these new products. We've probably got some older SKUs out there that will just help us from an overall cost. And then we're beginning to deploy some advanced analytics around understanding our freight and logistics costs, and especially in the year that we've kind of come through this year, those costs are meaningful. And our ability to use some of these advanced tools to improve our efficiency around that are going to be a really important source of productivity. On the Seed side, we've been really focused on field productivity. How do we get more seed out of a given acre? And there are some things that we can continue to do to help educate our seed producers to be more productive and effective and spread our fixed costs out over more units. And on top of that, we still have some seed conditioning facilities around the world that, as we look at where our growth is occurring and where we need those assets, probably have some additional reductions. I think we're down 34% in Seed assets to date since we've merged. That's a big number, but there are still a few more. And then finally, I've always been a person focused on inventory and write-downs, around making sure that we produce the seed that we need for a season, but don't produce too much when you wind up writing off some of that. So I really like the list that we have. And I think you'll continue to see really good flow-through into '22. What else would you add, Dave? Dave Anderson : I think the thing I would just say too is, we'll provide specifics, Jim, subs of list of in-flight productivity initiatives. And we'll provide more specifics as we get into the 2022 outlook and provide more color around that. So -- but count on us. I mean, I think that's a very important item. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas at JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : I have a couple of questions around cash flows. Your cash flow from operation estimate is pretty wide, $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion. And so why is it so wide? Why is it so low relative to your EBITDA of $2.55 billion? So it's like 50% or 60% of EBITDA. On your cash flow statement, it looks like there's about $800 million that went out for pension and OPEB benefits, but your pension line just went down by about $400 million. So can you explain the cash flow constellation? What normally should be your ratio of operating cash flow to EBITDA? Dave Anderson : Yes. No. It's a really good question. And it gets a bit confusing, because you may recall, we did a fairly significant change in our OPEB provision at the end of 2020, basically moving much closer, if you will, to market in terms of OPEB. And as a result of that, there's a flow-through of an accounting entry that we made at the end of 2020 that really affects the cash from operations presentation in the financials. So that's #1. And we can explain more of that offline if you'd like to go through it now in more detail. I think the important thing you talked about which is really a key one. It's just the range estimate that we're giving in the level of that range estimate in terms of cash from operations for 2021. It's reflective of a couple of things. Number 1, 2020 was really, in many respects, anomalous in terms of both cash collections and prepaying that we got from customers. And as a result of that, it's probably on a year-over-year basis somewhere in the neighborhood of about $600 million, if you will pull forward of cash or an increase in cash that benefited 2020. Now we're getting the benefit of that in 2021 because that's really helping us. One of the things we talked about is returning cash to shareholders. And if you look at our net debt, if you will, on a year-over-year basis, cash on hand minus debt balance, the numbers are actually quite attractive in terms of what we have there. And that's where the reflective of that very positive cash that we got at the end of the year. But the big difference, when you look at our guide this year versus last year, you look at the guide in terms of what you think of, is really that year-over-year change in working capital, mostly related to the timing of prepay as well as collections. And then the other part is we're building working capital right now. We're building working capital as part of the investment for growth. We're doing that in advance of what we see as a strong continued seasonal growth, LatAm, Europe, elsewhere. And the other thing that I would just add there, and I stated this, I think, in the prepared remarks, is the improvement we're seeing in operating working capital turns. So we've got the improvement of DSO, improvement in days sales inventory. And we're really tracking that very closely. So we're on top of this. Feel good about this, to understand the year-over-year difference that you're looking at. Jeff Zekauskas : All right. And then quickly for my follow-up. When you look at herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, is there a meaningful difference in operating margin between those 3 subdivisions? Or are they all the same? Jim Collins : Great, Jeff. Clearly, as our pipeline begins to deliver and we're driving newer classes of chemistry, we're seeing some nice margin lift in our -- like our insecticides portfolio, which is benefiting from products like Isoclast. And then in herbicides, as we've launched Rinskor, we've launched Arylex. And as we continue to trim, including some of those oldest industries, like we talked to you about late last year as we exited a few of those older products. But maybe Rajan, do you want to provide a little higher-level summary there, a little more detail there? Rajan Gajaria : Yes. I think, Jim, you are spot on. I think the biggest difference is not between the indications, but it is about the newness of the technology. So there is a lot of herbicides which would be \"commodity\" type of businesses. And the margin there would be lower than the new products. With the new herbicides, like Jim mentioned, Arylex and Rinskor come, 2 examples, their margin would be as high as what a differentiated insecticide would be. But just the fact that there is a lot more herbicides which would be more commodity base, it might feel like the margins are lower in herbicides. So typically, across the industry, you would say that insecticides and fungicides have higher margins than herbicides, but that changes when you launch new products. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Just wanted to build on some of the drivers for next year. So you mentioned price is probably going to be incrementally better than cost assuming inflation is -- ultimately stabilizes here. And you have the productivity as well and you have the new product pipeline. I would imagine acreage also is a positive driver. Could you just touch on how we should start thinking about '22, if at all possible? Jim Collins : Yes. I think you've hit those right. We've talked about price being an improvement. We've talked about our new product sales growth. I mean, if you look at -- we updated our new product revenue in 2021. We previously thought we had about $300 million of incremental year-over-year revenue from that pipeline. We updated that today, that it's going to look like more like $400 million in 2021. We'll keep carrying that momentum forward. And then I think you characterized it right. Market will be a supporter of growth going forward. We'd expect the overall market to be up 3% to 3.5%. And you mentioned acres, and we're watching that very, very closely. We would expect to see, especially Brazil, planted area could be up in that 4% to 5% range. The demand for Brazil beans and also corn is really strong. And growers have a lot of good resources today, a lot of good cash. They're investing in their operations, They're investing in their operations, especially in that Safrinha market where we're really strong from a technology perspective. So acres in Brazil will be one of those drivers. And then I think in the United States, we could see another modest increase in total, both U.S. corn and soybean acreage possible, going into '22. Now I'm not talking about 5 million or anything like that. It could be 1 million here or 1 million there, but I think the U.S. market for '22 is set up to also be pretty strong acre wise. Arun Viswanathan : Great. And just as a quick follow-up. On the raw materials side, have you guys looked into any strategic sourcing alternatives? I know that there are some issues on the chlorine side. But what can you share as far as raw materials and how those should evolve over the next couple of periods? Jim Collins : Yes. I'll have Rajan share some of the specifics. I just want to acknowledge the agility and the capability of our supply chain team through this year so far. As we came into late 2020, we saw these headwinds coming. We shared a lot of that with you as we set our guide for 2021. And we put our teams hotly focused on the agility of how would we alter supply chains, how would we make sure that we were understanding where we were going to be tight and get out ahead of some of these logistics. I think about what's going on in Brazil right now, we're a month or 2 earlier in our logistical supply chains of getting material to Brazil than we ever have been. And I think it's just a real testament to how quickly this team pivoted. But do you want to talk about some of the specific materials? Rajan Gajaria : Absolutely, Jim. Arun, I just wanted to share 2 examples to reinforce what Jim said. And these examples are 2 that it's an ongoing process. But the first one that comes to mind is precious metals. So we use our key products manufacturing. And we were working with rhodium. And when we saw the prices of rhodium beginning to go through the roof, our technical teams worked very closely and made a shift to the catalyst they use to palladium. So that's an example. And that really helps does not only make sure that we have reliable supply and product, but also manage cost. Another example is in the broad category of co-formulants. We've had some co-formulants which essentially were a real challenge because of the Texas freeze. And our teams pivoted, have made some significant changes and ensured that there was no disruption of supply. So a short answer, yes, absolutely looking at that, but those are 2 specific examples here. Jim Collins : Yes. And I think we've got good visibility, Arun, of those as we're building our plan for 2022. We're going to continue to drive productivity to stay out ahead of a number of those. And as I said before, we've got that pricing lever well in hand as well to make sure we're covering these costs as they come. Operator : And our final question today will come from John Roberts from UBS. John Roberts : Jim, it's a little early to wish you well in your retirement at year-end, but I wish you well. But could you give us an update on the succession process? And do you think you'll be introducing your successor on the next call? Jim Collins : Great, John. Thanks for those comments. And look, what I can say right now is I'm 100% focused here and in the role and continuing to drive the business, working with my team. We're very solidly focused on delivering 2021. I've committed to working hard to make sure that we're setting up a really strong start for 2022. And my job right now is supporting this organization through that transition. This team is well positioned to continue to drive the business forward. And I think what we've just delivered here in our first half is a good indication of that. But the strategy is on track, that we're accelerating the penetration of some of the new technologies. And that, as Dave has shared, we've got a great handle now on our capital allocation model. So I'll admit it's a little bit sooner than I had expected. But if a change was going to happen, it needed to happen when the organization was really hitting on all cylinders. So I couldn't be more proud and thankful of the team and how they remained really focused. The Board is driving that succession process. And there's not much I can comment on today about the -- in terms of timing or possible candidates. I know the Board remains very focused on identifying the right talent to help carry forward Corteva's success. And until then, I'm here extremely focused on making sure that we don't miss a beat. Operator : And that concludes today's Q&A session. I'll turn the call back over to our speakers for concluding remarks. Jeff Rudolph : We thank you for joining our call today and your interest in Corteva. And we hope you have a great day. Thanks again. Jim Collins : Thanks, everybody Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jeff Rudolph, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jeff Rudolph : Good morning. And welcome to Corteva's Third Quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Our prepared remarks today will begin with introductory remarks by Chuck Magro, Corteva 's newly appointed Chief Executive Officer, followed by an overview of the quarter and year-to-date financials from Dave Anderson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

These items provide a reconciliation of differences between reported GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered a substitute to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Corteva, Chief Executive Officer, Chuck Magro. Chuck Magro : Thanks, Jeff. And thank you to all those joining us on the call and webcast today. I'm honored to be speaking with you after having spent the last several days getting to know the team. Before I provide some early perspective, let me first say thank you to Jim Collins, who is guiding me through the transition over the next several weeks. I have known Jim for a very long time and it is a privilege to build on the strong foundation he laid for long-term growth at Corteva, with culture and innovation at its core.  Now I recognize it's only day 4, so Dave will walk you through the quarterly results in the full-year outlook. But it's important for me to first share some thoughts on why I believe that this is an unparalleled opportunity to lead at Corteva. Starting first with the strength of the franchise, which I believe is an industry leader in terms of balance and differentiation. In my experience in this industry, I always admired and respected how Corteva worked so closely with farmers to consistently provide best-in-class technology to drive value.  And further the breadth and depth of Corteva portfolio is impressive as it scale reaches all parts of the globe in a competitively advantaged way. This is why I believe when combined with strong execution, Corteva can be the industry leader for years to come, which brings me to my second point, operational performance. This quarter's results attest to what this team has built at Corteva. A commitment to operational excellence and efficiency has kept the Company's supply chains open in the midst of ongoing disruptions. And a culture focused on delivering for customers and keeping each other safe has kept the organization on track, meeting its commitments. This is another quarter of revenue and earnings growth, which are a direct result of the strong foundation this team has built over the past 2.5 years. Over the past few days, I've spent a lot of time listening to and learning from my team.  And I can already say this team is fully equipped to deliver on what we all know this Company is capable of. From the expertise of our commercial and operations teams to the deep capabilities of our R&D organization. It is abundantly clear to me that through the combination of the Company's strong culture and organizational strengths, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead. To summarize, tremendous assets, operational performance, and an excellent team, early a few things I am really excited about and what attracted me to this opportunity. I understand your expectations and I am confident we will deliver.  We have the IP, the commitment to operational excellence. And the customer relationships necessary to deliver long-term solutions to global issues, while serving the best interest of our shareholders. We will always continue to deliver innovative and productive solutions for farmers, expand opportunities for our employees, and build long-term value for our shareholders, all with sustainability as a priority. And with that, let me now turn it over to Dave, to take you through the results and the updates to our guidance. Dave Anderson : Thanks Chuck, and behalf of the Corteva team, I want to say we're all very excited to have Chuck join us at this time. It's a terrific position for the Company and we've got tremendous value that we can deliver. I want to welcome everybody also to the call. Let's start on Slide 5, which shows our financial results for the quarter and also year-to-date. Starting on the left side of the chart, you can see it was another solid 3 months of continued growth and margin improvement. Compared to the prior year, we delivered 24% organic growth gains in both seed and crop protection, led by Latin America and North America. In the quarter, we saw accelerated demand from customers, particularly in Latin America which translated into an estimated a $100 million in sales in the quarter that was previously forecasted in the fourth quarter. Looking at earnings, we delivered seasonal loss of $51 million of operating EBITDA in the quarter, which is an improvement of greater than a $120 million compared to the prior year. Turning to the year-to-date results, organic sales were up 9% to just over $12 billion. The growth was led by continued demand for new products, driving more than $330 million in growth from new crop protection products. Seeds sales improved on increased planted area in U.S. soybeans and also strong demand for corn in Latin America. EBITDA of $2.31 billion year-to-date, up 25% compared to the same period last year. And year-to-date pricing coupled with volume gains, more than offset cost headwinds, driving nearly 220 basis points of margin improvement compared to prior year. And this is particularly impressive given the challenges we're seeing in global supply chains and the cost inflation we continue to face. And we believe it's a clear differentiator for Corteva. Let's go then to Slide 6, with more detail on our global sales growth, here you can see the balance and diversity of the global business in the results. In North America, organic sales were up 5% through the first 3 quarters. Seed sales benefited from increased planted area for both corn and soybeans, as well as the continued penetration of Enlist E3 soybeans. Consistent with last quarter, Enlist E3 represents about 35% of the U.S. soybean market in 2021. Feedback from growers on performance to this point is quite positive. Corn price was up 2% or soybean prices were down 3% as we continue to see competitive pressure in that market.  North America crop protection delivered year-to-date organic sales of 10%, demand for new technologies, including Enlist Herbicide remained strong herbicide and fungicide growth were both up double-digits. Price increased 3% through the third quarter on price execution in response to rising input costs, including raw materials, freight and logistics. In Europe, Middle East, and Africa we had strong organic sales growth of 7% resulting from price execution in record sunflower seed volumes. This growth was muted by an approximate $80 million to $100 million sales impact from corn supply shortages in '21. In crop protection the portfolio of new and differentiated products remain in high demand, including technologies such as Arylex herbicide and Zorvec fungicide, which enabled us to drive price, volume and gain market share in Europe, despite the impact of discontinued products. In Latin America, we realized 27% organic sales growth on strong volumes in price gains, driven by execution on our price for value strategy, coupled with increases to offset rising input costs. In seed volumes grew 16% driven by market share gains in Brazil, safrinha in earlier shipments for the Brazil summer season.  In crop protection, volumes grew 18% on significant demand for new and differentiated technologies, such as ISEH class and Jemvelva insecticides. In Asia-Pacific, we delivered 7% organic sales growth compared to prior year, with both volume and pricing gains. Seed volumes were down largely due to COVID, related demand impacts, particularly in Southeast Asia, in India. Crop protection, organic growth of 11% was led by continued demand for new products, including [Indiscernible] herbicide, and also Paraoxon insecticide.  Let's move now to Slide 7 for a detailed review of our operating EBITDA performance through the third quarter. Through the first 9 months, operating EBITDA grew more than $460 million to approximately $2.3 billion. This was driven by strong organic growth with combined price and volume benefits of more than $600 million. As we continue to benefit from new and differentiated products against a strong market backdrop. We recognized pricing gains in both segments in all regions during the period. Global corn price was up 4% year-to-date, demonstrating the value that we bring to customers.  Sales of new crop protection products grew more than $330 million versus the prior year and price increased 4% for the segment, which helped offset higher raw material and logistics costs. With respect increased costs, we recognized roughly $350 million of market-driven cost headwinds year-to-date, as well as $70 million of increased compensation costs and investment spend to support growth. This was partially offset by approximately $200 million in productivity initiatives resulting in a net cost headwind of $220 million through the first 3 quarters.  Very importantly, disciplined execution while managing through complex supply chain dynamics, translated into more than 200 basis points improvement in operating EBITDA margin through the first 9 months of the year. Again, a clear differentiator. Let's go down to Slide 8, where I would like to discuss the current state of the global supply chain. Like other companies and obviously various industries, we continue to face supply chain challenges and cost inflation. And to reiterate the theme we discussed at the end of the second quarter. We believe these challenges will continue through 2022.  We've seen the cost of some of our key raw materials and co-formulas increase more than 20% in the past year, driving expected overall cost inflation to low, to mid-single-digits as a percent of our cost of sales. In addition to longer shipping times, we've also experienced additional downtime from supply constraints. Impart due to the more than 60 [Indiscernible] declared directly from suppliers, or indirectly from other raw material suppliers. Now to help offset the impact of inflated in input costs, we're utilizing operational levers such as pricing in very focused productivity initiatives. As an example, on October 1st, we announced one average mid-single-digit price increases in the U.S. on the majority of our Crop Protection products, this includes externally source polite to say, where we expect our pricing will be up approximately $90 million for the full year.  Now, just for context [Indiscernible] sales represent less than 5% of our total annual crop protection sales but the inflation impact has been significant. With this backdrop, it's impressive that we're achieving attractive performance measured by on-time delivery to customer request. The agility and flexibility that our teams are demonstrating has enabled us to capitalize on evolving market conditions, including increased demand for both seed and crop protection products.  With that, let's go to Slide 9. I'd like to provide the update on our full-year 2021 outlook. We're raising our full-year revenue guidance, We now expect reported net sales in the range of $15.5 to $15.7 billion, up 10 at the midpoint over 2020. We feel confident in this growth based on strong market fundamentals, continued demand for new and differentiated products globally in both crop protection and seed segments, and price execution in all regions coupled with pricing for higher input costs. They're mostly as a result of market-driven factors mentioned earlier, we're raising our estimate for full-year costs by 100 million for the year, per top -- predominantly in crop protection. We're now expecting a total increase of $475 million versus prior year. In addition to these headwinds, we also expect increased SG&A and R&D costs of about $50 million, which includes spend for increased compensation, as well as investment spent to support growth. Importantly, we're reaffirming and firming the full-year expectation to deliver operating EBITDA in the range of $2.5 to $2.6 billion for the year.  And improvement of 22% over 2020 at the midpoint. This translates to approximately a 150-basis points of margin expansion for the full year. And lastly, we're now forecasting a base tax rate in the range of 18% to 20%. coupled with a lower average share price count due to our share repurchase activity, we have increased our operating EPS guidance to a range of $2.05 to $2.15 per share for the year. Let's now -- let's go to slide 10 and focus on 2022. As you can see on slide 10, we've given you our initial planning framework and you recall that we shared this with you last quarter. It's intended as a reminder of the key assumptions as we frame out the '22 plan, including organic revenue growth, seed pricing versus commodity costs, strong penetration of new products, royalty cost improvement, and continued cost inflation, partially offset by productivity initiatives. Importantly, this is all with the backdrop of continued strong market outlook, and solid grower economics, which will drive customer demand in 2022. Turning to Slide 11, aligning with our midterm EBITDA target range for 2022. On the left of Slide 11, we've shown you at a high level, the bridge from our 2021 operating EBITDA guide to the EBITDA range implied by our mid-term targets.  Now let's go to the right side and cover a few of these key points. Market fundamentals remain positive in our early views are that use corn and soy acres will be approximately $180 million in total with a slight shift to soy, based on relative economics at this time. Outside of the U.S., market growth looks strong in markets like Brazil where planted areas expected to increase 4 to 5%. In terms of organic growth, we expect that the global seed portfolio will continue to deliver on our price for value strategy.  Where we expect 2022 pricing to be an excess of estimated seed costs headwinds from higher commodity prices. Crop protection, new and differentiated products, including Arylex and Enlist Herbicide, and Isoclast Insecticide will be a primary driver in delivering above-market in that segment. Turning to our early assumptions on costs, we've increased our estimate of seed commodity price impacts and expect to see seed cost increases in the range of $250 to $300 million, largely driven by North America and Latin America. As I mentioned earlier, we expect seed pricing to outpace these costs in 2022. In crop protection, market-driven inflation will continue through 2022 and we expect cost headwinds of at least $150 million. This includes the impact of the sell-through of inventory and continued cost inflation as a result of the supply chain conditions, we've already discussed. It's too early to comment on when we think costs will level off. However, we will be using operational levers, such as pricing and productivity initiatives to mitigate cost headwinds.  This provides additional transparency into our preliminary planning for 2022 and how that bridges to our midterm target EBITDA range. Put simply, price and volume will be critical to earnings and margin growth against the backdrop of strong customer demand and also continued cost and supply chain challenges. We will be providing more specifics during our fourth quarter earnings call in early February and communicating the full '22 guidance at that time. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff Rudolph : Thanks, Dave. Now, let's move onto your questions. I would like to remind you that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. And good morning, everyone and nice to chat with you again, Chuck. Just curious. Vincent Andrews : Chuck, you have a very unique vantage point on this coming from coming from nutrient and obviously being one of the largest agri retailers and you competed with Corteva on the seed side of the equation. You had level end and you competed with everybody on your proprietary products over there. So, you highlighted everything that you thought was the strengths of the Company, but where do you come into this with from the outside as a prior competitor thinking that there's some things that you need to firm up or some things that could be done a bit better that differently or were some blind spots are that you need advantage point on that you come into the organization and really hit the ground running with? Dave Anderson : Yes. Thanks for the question Vincent. And it's good to talk to you again. So, first of all, what I'd say is I'm really excited to be joining such a great Company and an awesome management team. You're right. So, I know Corteva. I know Corteva because they were a top tier supplier to the nutrient. And what I'd say to you though is in the last couple of days I've spent time with the Board of Directors, a lot of time with my team. And I have seen some of the operations already in just a short period of time, and certainly everything that I've seen is exceeding my expectations. So, my early impressions are extremely positive. I've had a good look at some of the elements of our technology pipeline. Obviously, I'm able to see it from a unique vantage point now. So, I had a peek under the hood and I will say that there is a growth engine here, a very impressive growth engine. The manufacturing footprint, when I look at it, probably the last 2 quarters have been the hardest in our industry in many, many years. And our supply chain is holding up with quite a bit of resiliency and that's because of the diversity that I've certainly seen. There will be focused areas of course, that I will start to talk to the team about.  But it is only day 4 for me, so I just want to say that I'm excited to be here and some of the areas that I'm going to work with the team on just to give you a sort of a flavor. Of course, our customers we're going to put them first. This Company has already done that but we have a unique set of advantages and core competencies with our technology and our supply chain and everything we do; we're going to put our customers first. Second is sustainability, climate change, reduction of acreage, things that really drive yields and improve performance for farmers. These are things that I think Corteva is uniquely positioned to, is to really drive the sustainability agenda for agricultural farming around the world. Chuck Magro : And then finally, we have some commitments out there. We're going to deliver on those commitments. So, the execution of the strategic plan will become a very top priority. And if you've heard me talk before, I'm a very big believer in controlling what we can control. And that we really want to be known as the best operator in the industry. Because I think that that really complements our technology platform. So hopefully that gives you a bit of color of some of the initial impressions in some of the things that the Corteva team was already talking about, but will be of interest to me as well as I integrate myself with this wonderful team. Operator : We will go to our next question from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Joel Jackson : Hey, Chuck. Chuck, we think the Chinese product contract is going to sell out. No, I'm just kidding. But seriously, you've moved from one part of the industry to another part of the industry. And you put out this slide deck on day 3 on the job, fair enough. But I want to know these are targets at Corteva had for some time for 2022, you call them initial planning framework, cleaning and planning framework would ever want to call them.  But Chuck, you're probably going to be judged on whether you hit these numbers next year. And so, I have to believe you must have had a lot of comfort level that you can hit at least the midpoint of its guidance range with maybe some cushion above it to want to own these numbers. Can you specifically as possible talk about that and your confidence that you can hit those numbers? Chuck Magro : Fair, Joel. Nice to hear your voice again. Look, so the management -- I have confidence in the management team. I'll tell you that right now. The team did reaffirm the outlook, I was certainly involved in that. And I will tell you that there is a lot of focus across the Company throughout the world on those -- on the outlook numbers. And it is only day 4, I'll just remind you. I will plan to dig in on the fundamental assumptions from the ground up. Obviously, I haven't had time to do that, but I will say a couple of things. There is a lot of potential in this Company. There a lot of catalyst and leavers that are within the management teams control and that they are highly focused on, which will drive long-term value creation for shareholders. The other thing is look, we believe that the agricultural backdrop is still going to be quite positive as we enter 2022, we've got good planted acreage we expect in corn and soybeans next year, we're going to see increased acreage in Brazil.  I think that when we look at farmer economics, they are still very constructive. Your potash question, I'm going to keep to the side. But overall, we think that the backdrop for the egg markets are quite positive. And then if you look at what Corteva can do within it to control in terms of price, Vincent Andrews : new products, extension of its channel strategy. These are all things that the management team is highly focused on, and when you add it all up, that's why we felt it was important to at least put the outlook numbers out there. And just to reiterate, I will look into it in a lot more detail, but I have confidence in this management team. Operator : Our next question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Patrick Cunningham : Hi, this is Patrick Cunningham on for P.J. Good morning, everyone. You mentioned growth from biological. And Chuck, you briefly touched on our growth engine. You mentioned 17 new launches in '21 and '22, how big is this business for you? And where do you think it could go in 5 years? Chuck Magro : Yes. Hi, Patrick. So, look, I'm going to have Rajan on talk to that because he will give you the details. From my vantage points obviously, we have some very unique technology in this area. It is a market that is growing. It's becoming more and more important when you think about it through a sustainability lens. It's quite an interesting market, but it requires unique science and technology to really deliver for customers. And I think Corteva is going to be a real winner in this area, and maybe Rajan you can talk about the specifics. Rajan Gajaria : Sure, Chuck and thank you for the question, Patrick, when we think about the opportunities in the biologics business, the first message I want to leave with you is, we see this as an indicatively with the rest of our crop protection business. So, I think that the strength of our Crop Protection franchise, coupled with very, we're headed with biologics is the reason for our optimism. A strategy I would say, I will explain 3 prongs to it. The first part is in licensing very unique technology.  And our team has worked to get more than ten of these signed up in the last 12 months where a lot of our optimism is coming from. And these are global companies from Israel, France, Brazil, Spain, to name a few. Very strong in-licensing. The second thing we are working on is we've got a very strong commercial organization, which I know you are familiar with. We're working to build capabilities within our commercial organizations, supply chain, formulation and packaging.  And last but not the least, R&D to continue to supplement the in-licensing technologies that we get. And with that Jeff onboard now we will continue to explore opportunities to have bolt-on acquisitions with the support from the board to see how we can further accelerate. So really very exciting space for us, we do have a very strong franchise in the natural products that you're familiar with, the spin-off and franchises already more than $800 million. We are familiar with this space and really looking forward to seeing how further launches will help but continue to accelerate the growth. Operator : We'll go to our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin Mccarthy : Yes. Good morning. And congratulations to you, Chuck. A couple of questions. First on the financial side, you increased your free cash flow guidance $300 million on the low-end to $550 million. Can you talk through the drivers of that presumably working capital played a role and I'd be interested to know how much you view as structural versus transitory. And then secondly, on the fundamental side, one of your competitors has been quite vocal about short stature corn. Be interested to hear your thoughts on that subject and whether that might play a role for Corteva in the future. Chuck Magro : Kevin. Dave can take the question on cash and Rajan then we'll follow up with short stature corn. Go ahead, Dave. Dave Anderson : Good. Yeah. So, Kevin, thanks very much. Good morning. So, on the cash flow, you'll recall, you may have referenced the previous cash map operation slide that we had or guide rather that we had of 12 to 16. We're now at 17 to 19. So reflects a couple of things, I think number 1, as you know, we have focused a lot on basic operational disciplines around [Indiscernible] cash and particularly on working capital. So, there's a portion of this, back to your structural, it's really related to that in both -- Patrick Cunningham : receivables and also in our payables area. Those are 2 areas we've really been working on and deploying talent and the right disciplines and systems to support that, so those are important contributors. We've also increased the amount of prepaid assumption just in terms of the liquidity that our customers have. And just what we're seeing already in terms of cash coming in related to that. So, you could say that it's more -- call it temporary as opposed to structural. We've also got some improvement in terms of net income with the lower tax rate that we've guided to. And that's part of, as you know, our EPS Dave Anderson : guide increase also reflects a little bit more on the EPS front reflects some a little bit lower share count compared to what we had in there previously. Given the strength of our share buyback program. So that's really it in a nutshell. And so, to distribution to your point in terms of structural and more temporary. But the structural part is very, very important in terms of what we're going to be able to deliver. We feel confident in that updated guide. And that's obviously very supportive of our shareholder value objectives. And then the second part of that? Rajan Gajaria : Sure. I'll take that. Kelvin, good morning. This is Rajan. Kevin, thank you for your question on short nature of [Indiscernible] when you think about the whole of breeding engine that Corteva has, as you know, Corteva has the best jump blossom. In the world. The whole pool of jump blossom that we have, is something that we continue to build on. Innovation and expenditures that we have on breeding is the strongest investment that we make in our seed business. There is multiple tools that we have in the breeding area.  Short stature gone is definitely one of the areas that We have focused on, but not limited to. We have a very strong history of growing the yield improvements that it's 1.5 to 2% year-over-year of not only getting the yield improvements, but also extracting value from that. Looking forward to sharing some more details with you in some future innovation Dave, but Chuck [Indiscernible] is on the list of things that we continue to innovate it. And we're looking forward to sharing the progress. Operator : Go to our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Good morning. And Chuck congrats as well on the new role. Just 2 quick questions. First Chuck, what's your view on the [Indiscernible] pricing pressure you're seeing and the Company's strategy to deal with that pressure? And maybe would you, Dave, just on the Crop Protection pricing. How sustainable or are these prices if [Indiscernible] do moderate or rollover? Thank you very much. Vincent Andrews : Thanks, David, so I've always been impressed with as a customer with Corteva seed technology. We are seeing very solid demand in corn and soybeans really strong demand in line with our expectations for the Enlist lineup. And Tim can take the specifics around the pricing. So, go ahead, Tim. Tim Glenn : Yes. Thanks. David, good question. So, on soybean market, we've been talking about this for a number of years, the markets have been competitive and they remain very competitive. But I think when you look at where we're at, we've got -- we've had very good momentum. And I'll speak on a global standpoint, from a seed standpoint, we've been able to capture about 3% year-to-date globally on seeds and in some segments, even more like corn, where we were about 4% global year-to-date.  We have launched our pricing in most of the Northern Hemisphere including soybeans, and consistent with the past, we are taking the leadership position in terms of capturing value for our strong product performance. And as always, it's a strong -- it's a very competitive marketplace, no doubt about it. And we will -- we're going to continue to execute against our strong value proposition. We have a strong, disciplined organization in terms of managing our pricing process and the feedback on our products. We're in the middle of harvest still, But feedback on product performance has been very good from a genetic standpoint. And the demand for E3 platform is extremely strong. So, we're feeling good about where we sit. And as always, we'll deal with the competition. When you think about CP pricing and where we're at there, we've been working hard to build a strong execution capability on pricing there as well. And throughout the year, we've been very proactive to ensure that we're capturing value for our technology and also helping to mitigate the inflationary pressures that are out there.  And I would say that we've been I think on the leading edge from an industry standpoint, probably first-mover as soon as the first quarter of this year in terms of repricing to try to manage to those escalating prices. For commodity products like glyphosate, that's very dynamic. And we're going to continue to price that on an ongoing basis. And really focus on ensuring that we offset all the inflationary cost pressures that we're seeing there. Excluding glyphosate, we've been able to capture about 3% year-to-date on across our crop protection portfolio.  In some categories, on our most differentiated products like the [Indiscernible] were up about 8% year-to-date, which is really outstanding. And we're going to be proactive. We are going to be strategic as we wrap up 2021. And then as we set the stage for 2022, we've already implemented pricing for most of the Northern Hemisphere in 2022. And again, our expectation, as Dave said earlier, that we've implemented roughly mid-single-digit pricing across most of our portfolio in North America. And we're going to continue to focus on that, continued to remain very disciplined. And obviously, as we work through and deal with more pressures, we're going to continue to offset those as they come forward. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Parkinson with Mizuho. Chris Parkinson : Great. Thank you very much. And Chuck good to have you back. As we head into '22, you just said are a little bit on this. But could you just further comments on regional CP pricing. The potential for incremental contributions for new product volume after a strong 21 performance thus far. And then also just spin-offs and momentum. So just any regional color I would be appreciated on this factors. Thank you so much. Dave Anderson : Yeah. I'll jump in there and talked about that in, and obviously our markets are very local. So, when we talk about CP pricing, I'll talk about it in aggregate basis and we report it in an aggregate basis, but we are pricing locally. It's based off individual product formulations and what their fit is in the marketplace. And our teams are focused on ensuring that we are as locally competitive, understanding that we've got these global headwinds that we're constantly dealing with. So, we are going to be dynamic.  And most of the world's, I'd say isn't such a driver of price. So, it is our differentiated products that our teams are focused on. And when we talk about that 3% year-to-date price increase, and when we talk about the mid-single-digit price increase that we've already implemented in the Northern Hemisphere for next year. That is across our new and differentiated products as well. So, it's something that we're going to continue to focus on. We will execute that locally knowing that we've got these global headwinds that we're dealing with. And in terms of the contribution from new products going forward, it's been a huge part of what's helped us continue to perform above-market on the crop protection side. And in most parts of the world and will be again in 2022. So, we've got a robust pipeline. We've got great new products like Isoclast and Arylex and Zorvec, which are continuing to accelerate their growth pattern. We continue to get new registrations literally every month -- we're getting new registrations and so new products will be a very important part of our 2022 plan. Operator : Our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi, good morning. It's [Indiscernible] for Jeff. How are you? Dave Anderson : Good, thank you. Jeff Zekauskas : I was wondering if you can speak about the [Indiscernible], the E3 being launched in Brazil like that holler ramp up of that might look like. I guess probably very small for the additional growing season, but I was running if you look 2 or 3 years out. How many acres do you think you might achieve? And secondly, I was wondering, I can also like one more time as cost price issue for 2022.  So, in general, like the outlook that you have for 2022, to me doesn't look that [Indiscernible] Like if you can have with its 3 or 4 or 5% price increases on sales of 15 and a half billion, like that should offset what were all of your costs. And so, having EBITDA growth in 2022 shouldn't be that difficult despite all of the cost headwinds. What do you see a different than that? Because I see a much more optimistic than I hear in your voice. Thanks. Dave Anderson : So, 2 parts of that. Do you want to -- do you want to go first? Tim Glenn : Sure. I'll jump really quickly on the Zekauskas questions. So obviously. We were very excited in August when we were able to announce that we received authorization from the European Union that enabled grain from Conkesta E3 to be exported for food and feed use. So as a result, we have a limited launch of Conkesta E3 right now in Brazil. Farmers are able to plant product for the 2021, '22 season, so it's an important step forward. What I would reinforce though is it's really not a meaningful financial impact as we look at '21 or '22 as we are working on ramping up production, Jeff Rudolph : building out our lineup, and ultimately, we've got to go out there and getting customer support, and drive adoption of the technology. So over time, no doubt this technology is going to drive incremental growth for us. It's going to greatly enhance our competitive position in the Latin America soybean market, which is important for us and we're excited to bring new choice to the marketplace.  And the marketplace is excited to have a new choice in terms of technology as well. And then overtime, we are also going to introduce this in other markets, such as Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. So, it is something very important. We have not sized what we see the adoption rate as at this point in time, but understand it's a limited launch and it really is about establishing that technology and gaining support from our customers. David Begleiter : Zekauskas, good morning. This is Dave, I will take the second part of that related to 2022. As you said, and Chuck, really, I think articulated it well. It's really constructive setup when you look at 2022 with the backdrop of our markets. And the strength of what we're bringing, continue to bring to the market. And as you said, on price, we continue to execute against our strategy of pricing. Both Rajan and Tim have spoken about that, spoken to some of the specifics. And again, specifically for 2022 related to seed, we expect global pricing to be accretive to earnings after the impact of Dave Anderson : higher cost of goods sold. And by the way, again, just emphasize, we've increased that seed cost of goods sold in the range of $250 to $300 million now, so that's very important. And on crop, we expect to continue the momentum we've seen in 2021. But very importantly as 2 really important things here, number 1 is the market-driven inflation in logistics costs. Again, I'm going to just underscore that we anticipate to be at least a $150 million and we've seen this progression over the course of 2021, obviously. And we expect supply chain challenges to continue just to underscore that through 2022. So, these are some of what we see is sort of the balance against that constructive backdrop. And the strength of what we're bringing to the marketplace, and our ability to continue to drive, if you will value pricing in the marketplace. So, we're going to get into those details. As I said, when we release our fourth quarter earnings, 2021 will provide more specific guide. But it's really call it down the middle there in terms of the set of positives and constructive setup, what we're bringing to the table. And then this, if you will inflation impacts that we're seeing in the very dynamic nature of that. So, we appreciate your question, look forward to that uptake when we can provide more details. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Thank you. Got a follow-up for you, Tim, and that is about your seed orders for 2022 in the U.S. Where would you position them that right now? Are you close to having half of those orders in given where we are in the harvest? And any trends that you can comment on whether there is a mix shift in germplasm or trades, or perhaps even a mix shift in acreage between corn and soybeans. Tim Glenn : Yes. Thanks, Steve. And where we're sitting right now is, I would characterize this as kind of the middle part of our booking season in North America. We go out and see customers, call it September 1st, more or less, is when we begin to move in the marketplace and that booking period really extends through the end of the calendar year. And so, we will expect by that time to have the majority, nearly all of our order position in place by the end of the year. We're in that middle position right now. And I'd say that orders are tracking well with where we would expect to be right now for both corn and soybeans. In terms of technology shifts, If anything, I would say that Enlist E3 demand on the pioneer side is running a little bit stronger than maybe what we had originally planned as we came into the year. In terms of the acre mix between corn and soy. I think it's very preliminary and way too early to make a call based off of our orders.  Right now, customers are going to go through the next several months and really have to figure out on an individual basis what, what their crop mix will be. And Dave made the comments about where we see the market going into next year, roughly a 180 million planted acres between corn and soy in the U.S. that's there. And right now, when you look at the corn soy ratio, it's about 2 to 7, which isn't so, which is actually pretty neutral I'd say on a year-over-year basis, but it feels like the economics are saying that we could trend a little bit more towards soybeans in terms of that 180 mix than last year, can't call it off the order position.  I'd say the corn technology mixers consistent with what we would expect it to be. Farmers have been planting high-technology seeds and continue to want to do that. And really, I'd say where we sit today really supports what Chuck and Dave already talked about in terms of our setup for 22% in terms of good healthy markets and also very strong demand for our technologies. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Thank you. 2 questions on pricing. And welcome back Chuck. On Crop Protection pricing, it ranges from flat in Asia-Pacific to 5% in Latin America. Does that basically track where the new products are having the most impact or is there something else behind the range in pricing, like the bundling rebates would seats. Tim Glenn : Yeah. John, I'll take. In terms of that element, I would say Latin America clearly has been benefiting from good, strong, healthy economy as well as that impact for new product technology. I don't think you can lay it only on that because actually we've got -- we've had some good technology adoption in Asia-Pacific as well. So good, strong product introductions, it really comes down to where we sit in those local markets and again, we are dealing in very competitive markets and actually on a year-to-date basis, APAC is not flat there are more like 2% year-to-date, so we do have some growth there as well.  So, I would say it's the markets themselves, it's the timing of when we would have executed the sale. And of course, that is very dynamic. Latin America is certainly more weighted towards the second half of the year. And we would have taken more pricing actions. I would say at to help mitigate some of the inflationary pressures that we've seen as the year develop and been able to realize that from a Latin standpoint, but I wouldn't say it's only because of the product mix or anything like that. I think it's -- could be timing and then that local competitive situation that you're facing in those markets. Operator : We'll now go to our next question from Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Michael Piken : Yes. Hi, I was just wondering if you could give us an update in terms of your Enlist platform, in terms of what percentage of your Enlist sales next year are going to come from your own germplasm and how broad, I guess your scope is going to be geographically. I was specifically wondering about the Southern U.S. and that market for unless next year as well. Thanks. Rajan Gajaria : Thank you, Michael, I'll take that this is a Rajan Gajaria, so first and foremost, just taking a step back, the overall adoption of the Enlist system really continues to meet our expectations the demand at the grower level across the U.S. is really very strong. And as we think about our own jump blossom, we've got a very strong pipeline of new products coming through. Most of them are going to start hitting in '23, '24, but we will start making an impact in 2022.  The germplasm is going to continue to grow within the Corteva germplasm as the trade gets integrated into our own portfolio. That said, I think the overall adoption is going to be higher than what we had said in 2021. As you know, we had expected about 30% and we grew to more than 35. And looking at the 2022 setup, we continue to see that continuing to grow. Some of the challenges that we have had in the south with dicamba continues to be a challenge of but when we look at the Enlist Herbicide performance of, I think we continue to get encouraged there.  The south is lagging in terms of adoption. But as we continue to work on the different varieties, how they're available, and we talk about the dicamba challenges. I'm very optimistic that we will be able to make some progress there too. The bigger issue in the South as I'm sure you're familiar, Michael is more about the entrenched dicamba capabilities that harvest. And as we work through some of those things, I think we will get to where we need to relate it to Enlist adoption. Operator : We'll go to our next question from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. And Arun, your line is open. Please check your mute button. Due to no response, we'll take our next question from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Yes. Good morning. Congratulations, Chuck. Good to speak with you again, looking forward to seeing you on Monday. You mentioned that your second priority was on the sustainability front and during the quarter. Corteva announced that their day-to-day carbon capture initiatives joint venture with Indigo. And I was wondering if perhaps someone on the team can talk about what the financial ramifications of this are? How does it fit into your current product offerings and any sort of initial feedback that you've received from this? Rajan Gajaria : Hi Frank. This is Rajan, I'll take that. I believe this is related to the whole value capture from a carbon perspective, but we're really excited about the relationship that we have gotten within Indigo. We had a pilot program plan for getting 200,000 acres this year. And we are going to exceed that. But as you think about sustainability and as we think about ways the whole value proposition for farmers is going to go. It's too early to say this is what the price of carbon is going to be. And that really is going to be one of the biggest assumptions that there is.  But the technology that Corteva brings from a digital standpoint. will help to make sure that we are tracking the behaviors that the farmers are going to change. The partnership with Indego brings capabilities that they have in terms of measuring the actual impact and get all this validated with third-party bodies in there. So, we're really excited about the possibilities and creating more of opportunities for a farmer customers to get additional revenue. Too early to comment on what the financial impact of that is, given the infancy of where we are trend. Operator : And our last question will come from Alexi Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Paul Sondron : Hi, this is Paul Sondron (ph) for Alexi just one quick one. What is your current outlook for seed royalties in 2022? Thanks. Rajan Gajaria : Yes. Hi, this is Rajan. I think taking a step back, we'll talk about our seed neutrality journey, we will continue to be on track for that. The seed royalty reduction in 2022 will be in the similar ballpark to what we have done in 2021. Give or take around $50 million. But the important thing is that, all the element in-play for us to continue to work with the royalty reduction. Are there of which is the Enlist adoption that we have been talking about is a big part of it. So that's how we look at royalties for 2022. Operator : And now I will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Rudolph, at this time, I'll turn the call back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Jeff Rudolph : Thank you. We appreciate everyone joining the call today. And again, thank you for your interest in Corteva. Have a great and safe day. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jeff Rudolph, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Jeff Rudolph : [Technical Difficulty] expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could materially differ from these statements due to these risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, those discussed on this call and in the Risk Factors section of our reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. Please note in today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release and related schedules along with our supplemental financial summary slide deck available on our Investor Relations website. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Magro : Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call and webcast today. Corteva executed well in 2021 as ag fundamentals drove strong customer demand. For the full year, the company delivered double-digit sales and earnings growth, meaningful margin expansion and improved free cash flow. This included impressive performance out of Latin America, where the team delivered 27% organic growth on double-digit volume and price gains. In addition, we continue to advance our technology pipeline, where Enlist E3 soybeans reached 35% market penetration in the U.S. and new product sales in crop protection reached over $1.4 billion in total, an increase of more than 40% over the prior year. Our capital deployment, we returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases for the year. This past year was certainly not without its challenges, including a dynamic operating environment that impacted most global industries and manifested as supply chain disruptions, raw material and labor shortages and cost inflation. At the same time, the agricultural industry experienced significant demand for grain and oilseeds that easily outpaced supply, supporting crop prices and farmer income levels. Again, our teams executed very well in this environment. Turning to the outlook. We enter 2022 from a position of strength and look to carry forward our execution with best-in-class technologies to deliver value for growers and Corteva. This is overlaid against a market backdrop where solid ag fundamentals will drive customer demand and challenges from supply chain disruptions and inflation will persist. As a result, we expect to deliver 8% sales growth and between $2.8 billion and $3 billion in operating EBITDA for the year. Our priorities for 2022 are straightforward. We are going to focus on what we can control and execute on a balanced plan that is expected to deliver both growth and margin expansion. This includes continuing the penetration of new and differentiated products globally, capturing price aligned with the value of our products created for our customers and delivering on cost reduction initiatives. In order to achieve our full performance potential, we have begun a fresh look at various ways to unlock value at a faster pace, including our global product portfolio and operational footprint. I look forward to sharing more of these reviews as we progress this work. As I've shared with many of you already, I am very pleased with Corteva's balance sheet and cash flow potential. We have the financial strength to execute on a disciplined capital allocation strategy and we'll focus on funding high-margin growth opportunities and returning capital to shareholders. Now let's go to slide five where I will provide a bit more detail on the market outlook and some of our assumptions for 2022. Similar to 2021, agricultural demand remained solid as economies around the globe continue to recover from COVID-related shutdowns. This is expected to drive record demand for grains and oilseeds in 2022, which we believe will keep commodity prices at the elevated levels we are seeing in the market today. Over the medium to long-term, we see constructive fundamentals continuing as possible new demand to support renewable fuels such as bio-based diesel will likely support healthy agricultural commodity price levels. Production will be vital in 2022 to balance supply and demand. For the US, planted area is expected to be 90 million acres for both corn and soybeans. Given the current relative economics of commodity prices, our assumption reflects some shift from corn into soybeans as fertilizer prices remain high and some growers may be inclined to rotate into beans. This provides further support for systems like Enlist, where customer demand and industry-wide penetration remains strong and we anticipate it will grow to at least 40% of total US soybean acres in 2022. Current weather conditions in Latin America remain something we continue to monitor given the potential for risks around production and grower planting decisions. That said Brazil continues to be a very attractive market for growth and Corteva has an increasing market position given our portfolio and farmer relationships. Planted area in Brazil for the 2022-2023 season is expected to increase mid single-digits and growers will remain focused on best-in-class technology in both seed and crop protection to drive yields and maximize profit in this market. Growers balance sheets and income levels are healthy and we believe that customers will look to prioritize technology for 2022 to maximize return even with higher input costs across their operations. And lastly on inflation. We do expect raw material and labor cost to continue to increase in 2022. However, we are confident that our global pricing execution will keep pace and more than offset inflation for this year. And with that let me turn it over to Dave to provide details on our full year 2021 performance and our guidance for 2022. Dave Anderson : Thanks, Chuck and welcome everyone to the call. Let's start on slide 6, which provides the financial summary for the fourth quarter and the full year. We ended the year with another solid quarter of continued growth. Compared to prior year organic sales in the quarter increased by 9% with gains in both segments. Global pricing was up 8% by continued focus on our price for value strategy with double-digit pricing gains in seed led by Latin America. We delivered more than $260 million of operating EBITDA in the fourth quarter, an 11% increase from the same period last year. For the full year 2021, organic sales were up 9% to $15.5 billion. Crop Protection growth was led by continued demand for new products, which saw an increase of more than $450 million year-over-year. Seed sales improved on strong pricing execution particularly in corn which was up 5% globally coupled with increased planted area in the US and strong demand for corn in Latin America. Full year operating EBITDA of $2.58 billion was up 23% over 2020. Pricing and productivity more than offset cost headwinds driving almost 180 basis points of margin improvement. This improvement is a result of focused execution by the team, while managing through challenging supply chain dynamics and also continued cost inflation. Let's go now to slide 7 where you can see the strong top line results across every region. In North America organic sales were up 4% for the year. Seed sales benefited from increased planted area for both corn and soybeans as well as the continued industry-wide penetration of Enlist E3 soybeans which represented about 35% of the US soybean market in 2021. We finished the year with corn price up 2% in North America while soybean price was down 2% driven by competitive pressure in the market. North America Crop Protection delivered organic sales growth of 6% on continued demand for new technologies including Enlist herbicide. Both herbicides and fungicides finished the year with double-digit growth in the region compared to prior year. Crop Protection prices were up 6% in response to rising input costs. Crop Protection volumes were flat year-over-year in part due to the phaseout of select low-margin products and an approximate $70 million sales impact in the fourth quarter from supply constraints. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, we had organic sales growth of 6% driven by strong price execution and record sunflower seed volume. In Crop Protection demand remains high for new and differentiated products including Arylex herbicide and Zorvec fungicide, which enabled us to drive price and volume and gain market share in the region. In Latin America, we delivered 27% organic sales growth on strong volume and price gains. Execution on our price for value strategy, coupled with price increases to offset rising input costs led to price gains of 10% compared to the prior year. Seed volumes increased 14% driven by market share gains in Brazil safrinha, while crop protection volumes grew 19% on strong demand for new and differentiated products such as Isoclast and Jemvelva insecticides. Asia Pacific organic sales were up 3% compared to the prior year, with both volume and price gains. Seed volumes were down largely due to COVID-related demand impacts and competitive dynamics primarily in Southeast Asia. Crop Protection organic growth of 4% was led by continued demand for new and differentiated products, including Rinskor herbicide and Pyraxalt insecticide, both of which had volume gains in the region of more than 40% versus 2020. Let's now move to slide 8 for a summary of our 2022 guidance. We expect net sales to be in the range of $16.7 billion to $17 billion, representing 8% growth at the midpoint driven by pricing and strong customer demand for new products and our best-in-class technology. 2022 operating EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion, a 13% improvement over prior year at the midpoint. Margins are also expected to improve with pricing and productivity actions more than offsetting further cost inflation leading to an approximate 80 basis point improvement at the midpoint over prior year. Operating EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.50 per share, an increase of 12% at the midpoint, which reflects lower average share count, but also a higher effective tax rate assumption compared to 2021. Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion, which reflects more normalized receivables assumptions and replenishment of inventory in 2022. At the midpoint, it translates to an EBITDA to free cash flow conversion of approximately 50%. Let me talk about now the phasing of the first half versus second half revenue and operating EBITDA for 2022. On revenue, we expect strong revenue growth in the first half with 9% to 10% recorded growth, which would imply mid-single-digit growth for the second half. However, given the slower pace of inflation in early 2021 versus where we are today, we're expecting approximately 70% of our 2022 estimated cost headwinds will flow through in the first half. This is largely driven by the seasonal timing of seed costs, associated with higher commodity prices, and the pace of cost inflation in Crop Protection in 2021, which was more than weighted to the second half of the year. As a result, we expect mid-single-digit growth in operating EBITDA for the first half compared to prior year, whereas our full year guide for operating EBITDA growth is 13% at the midpoint. Let's now go to slide 9, where we'll provide some further detail on the key drivers included in the EBITDA guidance. Consistent with prior views pricing in seeds will more than offset the impact from higher commodity costs. For the year, based on demonstrated value creation of our seed products, we expect a global price lift of mid-single digits in local currency. Partially offsetting this is approximately $375 million of commodity costs largely from the US and Brazil. And again, we expect the majority of the cost headwind in seed will be recognized in the first half of the year. Increased planted area in Latin America and global demand for our best-in-class technology, including continued penetration of Enlist E3 soybeans are expected to drive volume increases in this segment. In Crop Protection, demand for new products remained strong and is expected to drive an additional $300 million in revenue for the full year. In addition, we expect cost headwinds to be approximately $300 million as the complex supply chain dynamics and cost inflation will continue at least through the end of the year. Similar to seed, the majority of these costs are expected to be recognized in the first half as we lap a lower cost basis in the first half of the prior year. Price increases will help mitigate these cost headwinds including another mid-single-digit price increase across the majority of our US Crop Protection portfolio that was implemented in early January. As it relates to SG&A, we're expecting $100 million in higher costs from investments to support growth and also more normalized bad debt accruals compared to 2021. In addition to pricing, we will continue to use productivity initiatives to drive margin improvement. For 2022, we expect productivity savings of approximately $200 million across both segments. And with a stronger US dollar, relative to other key currencies, on a year-over-year basis, we estimate a $200 million headwind from translation impact and hedging program costs. In addition to our implemented hedging programs, we'll continue to pursue local pricing where possible to mitigate this currency impact. Turning now to slide 10. I want to leave you with what we view to be the key takeaways from today's call. Obviously we delivered and very, very pleased with our 2021 commitments, including impressive margin growth and cash flow while navigating a dynamic operating environment. As Chuck mentioned, we enter 2022 from a position of strength. We expect a year of attractive growth supported by strong customer demand across the backdrop of a solid global ag fundamentals. We remain confident in our disciplined execution including pricing and productivity, which will in turn drive margin expansion for the year. Our balance sheet is strong, which provides us flexibility with our capital deployment strategy and allows us to build our track record of returning cash to shareholders while also continuing to fund growth opportunities. This is bolstered by improved funded status in our US pension plan which improved to better than 90% at the end of 2021. In 2022, we expect to return $1 billion to $1.5 billion of cash via dividends and share repurchases. This is on top of the more than $1.3 billion of cash returned in 2021. And it's a clear indication of our commitment to deliver value to our shareholders. Combined, we believe this further differentiates Corteva as we're well positioned to deliver value in 2022 and the years to come. And with that, I'm going to hand the call back over to Jeff. Jeff Rudolph : Thanks, Dave. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We ask that you please limit yourself to one question. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Joel Jackson at BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Go ahead. Joel Jackson : Hi. Good morning, Chuck, Dave. I know that the $2.95 billion leaseholder target midpoint was a placeholder. And now you're guiding to about $50 million less than what that stakeholder said. Can you -- with all the buckets you talked about all the moving parts, are you able to maybe talk about the $50 million delta? And also to that, is most of that really currency? And maybe you can elaborate a little bit on what the currency outlook is now for 2022 versus what you may have thought it was three months ago? Chuck Magro : Yes. Good morning, Joel. So, yes, the short answer is you're absolutely right. The difference -- the way we would look at it what's new would be currency. Let me give you the backdrop though of the guidance and what we're seeing in the market and then I'll turn it over to Dave to drill down on the currency situation. So, first of all, 2021 was a really strong year in ag. We saw very strong demand for our products higher prices across the board and farmers' balance sheets are strong in their income statements. And we expect very similar behavior in the ag markets in 2022. And right now our order book is full. So this market it's all about supply and price execution. And I think Corteva is set up to succeed in both of those areas. The guidance that we laid out today $2.8 billion to $3 billion of EBITDA, we think that that appropriately reflects the time of the year. Don't forget that the crop is not in the ground in Europe or in the United States yet as well as some of the market uncertainties that we're seeing, namely around cost and inflation. To your question though, so the midpoint of -- our midpoint of $2.9 billion it is double-digit growth. It is still in line with the previous targets that have been provided. But it does have a new assumption which is really around currency headwinds. Now, what I think is happening here is this is our current and best thinking today. The Corteva team is really focused on cost, cost mitigation, really taking the downside risk off the table, while at the same time reinforcing our supply chain resiliency, driving up execution both in price and supply chain to reach up as high as we can in terms of our guidance range here. And we're feeling pretty good about things, but it is so early in the season right now that this is our best thinking. And we'll -- like usual we'll reflect this as we go through the quarters -- every quarter. And I would expect that we would narrow our range over time. But to drill down on the specific question around currency I'll turn it over to Dave now. Dave Anderson : Sure. Joel just very quickly. And you're exactly right. As Chuck said currency really is the -- when you look through the lens it really is the fee in terms of our thinking and our planning here. Just a couple of things on currency. First of all, these are our best assumptions at this point in time. We use third-party obviously inputs for this. We also have as you know hedged positions. We come into the year with some hedged positions but most of those are cash positions. And then if you will the translation hedging that we do which is pretty much focused and limited but that cash or translation hedging that we do is also included in the assumption. When you look at it comparative, for example, what we provided back in October, it's $100 million difference. And that really does represent the if you will the variance compared to the guide that we had provided or call it the reinforcement of the mid-term guidance range that we provided at that time. And also to provide just a little bit of perspective on this, just take a minute is if you did simple math and looked at 2022 and just adjusted for currency and just say you were looking at equivalency. Instead of being up 11% in revenue, you'd be up around -- you'd be up higher than that. You'd be up -- instead of 8%, you'd be up 11% to around $17.1 billion. And in terms of EBITDA, rather than being up 13% at the midpoint of our guide, you'd be up around 20%, which would put us at $3 billion roughly even for the midpoint of the guide which would translate to margin almost double in terms of basis point improvement to around 140% 145%. So, again, just simple math but it provides insights hopefully to help address the point you're making. Joel Jackson : Thank you. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you., Good morning everyone. Maybe you could speak a little bit to the incremental seed cost inflation versus what you laid out three months ago which I think is about $100 million higher? And I guess a couple of ways to go about this is first you're now anticipating a greater gross amount of inflation in 2022 than you estimated for 2021. And clearly the commodity price increases in 2021 are far more significant than in 2022. So, I wonder if you could just bridge that. And maybe if you can just also help us understand how much of this inflation is coming in corn versus soybeans versus the balance of your seed portfolio and if it's related to any particular geography or associated with the uptick in Enlist acres to that 40% penetration that you're looking for? Dave Anderson : Sure. Why don't I take -- this is Dave. Why don't I take the first shot at that. And then Rajan, maybe you could add a little bit of color as well? Rajan Gajaria : Absolutely, Dave. Dave Anderson : Yes. So really the three components as you would suspect again, our reference in October in terms of seed cost inflation was in the $250 million to $300 million range, let's call it $275 million. We're now at $375 million so $100 million increase. It's primarily -- when you think of commodity impact, it's primarily in the EU. There are some others, but that's significantly where it's coming from. We also have some headwind -- additional headwind from yield. And then finally and this is a common refrain, is really freight and warehouse and essentially evenly distributed across those three. Rajan, any other commentary on the commodity costs? Rajan Gajaria : So just to build on that and Vincent to answer your specific question. The crop that we are talking about from a commodity standpoint in Europe would be gone I think. In fact, from a North America perspective, all the numbers were baked into the third quarter so nothing has changed. From a yield standpoint, we and the whole industry has had a tough thing with canola especially in Canada. And the yield impact there is increasing costs up versus what we had expected the last time we had said this. And the freight and warehousing this really goes across the board. We've got big increases not only in Brazil but also in North America. We've got some actions planned with advanced analytics et cetera to try and see what we can do to mitigate. But at this point of time that's where our cost increases versus the last time are coming in. That said, we feel very good about our ability to expand margins. The cost increases are here but the pricing actions we have and the productivity actions that we have planned should continue to drive the margin expansion in the seed business, like we saw in 2021. I think we will reinforce that in 2022. Chuck Magro : Yes. Just a couple of comments I guess for the company broadly speaking, Vincent. So the supply chain challenges are real. Any global supply chain operator like Corteva, will have the same situation. We think we've done a really nice job of mitigating as much of the cost as we can. And we've got a full court press on just doing exactly that for 2022. At the same time, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are seeing very strong demand across the board for our products around the world. So from a pricing perspective what we've been able to do and if you look at 2021 and then you look at how we've guided for 2022, the pricing increasing is offsetting the higher cost and we are driving margin. And I think that that is really important to set the stage. I know there's a lot of industries out there that were not able to do that. I think one of the good things about the agricultural industry right now is that, we're in a very attractive market. And I think growers need the products, they need the technology. And certainly from a pricing execution perspective, I think we've demonstrated that we can move prices to cover costs and grow margins. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Good morning. Can you talk about the pricing outlook in crop protection chemicals? I think you had proposed a mid-single-digit price increase effective October 1. How is that flowing through? And related to that, if I look at Slide 29 of your deck, the crop protection chemical pricing in the quarter for herbicides and insecticides seems very different, with herbicides running 15% on price/mix versus negative 2% for insecticides. So could you perhaps unpack that for us, and speak to some of the swing factors there such as glyphosate and the incremental pricing that you're layering in? Chuck Magro : Sure. Hi, Kevin. So you're right. There are obviously puts and takes. And it depends if we're talking about our commodity portfolio or our differentiated and new product portfolio. There are some differences there. But I'll have Tim just kind of walk you through a few of these, and that should hopefully set the context. Tim Glenn : Yes. Kevin, when you think about the Crop Protection side, you're right. You used the example in the US where we implemented a price increase in January -- or excuse me in October. And I'd say traditionally, we price on a seasonal basis for most of our products. And that's kind of the way Crop Protection has been done. You price at the beginning of the season. And obviously, you looked and managed through the course of the season but you're actively managing this.  Today I'd say, we're actively managing the crop protection pricing. As Dave said and Rajan reiterated, we're working hard and we will offset all the costs that we have. But the US example that you started with there we priced in October for the upcoming season and that's when we kick off our sales season. We announced in December an early January price increase across the board in the US and that was implemented and is in the marketplace right now. And we're going to continue to monitor that. And so that's how we're going to deal with this as we go forward is to continue to be able to monitor and act accordingly as we work through the season. And that's a very different behavior than what's typically happened certainly from our side. There are commodity products that are even different. And those heavy commodity products where we've seen a tremendous amount of cost and price volatility. We're active even more frequently than that. That's even more regularly. But across the whole portfolio, we're actively managing pricing across the board and we'll continue to do that. And the team is committed to do that. It's not just a US action. It's happening around the world. And that's how we're going to be able to offset it we work through this year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Parkinson at Mizuho. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Chris Parkinson : Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. So just a corollary of some of the response you just had. There were some increases in the cost assumptions in CPC versus initial framework. I think most of us understand that. Can you just comment on some of the dollar delta versus your prior expectations? Obviously, some of the subs are herbicides, but presumably it's broadly transportation logistics the generic inputs for formulation and perhaps intermediate pricing. But can you just comment on how you think these trends are actually going to evolve throughout 2022 just given the current dynamics? Thank you very much. Chuck Magro : Hi Chris, yes. So Rajan can maybe drill down on a few of the questions that you've got there. And then maybe Dave can wrap up with sort of the higher level how we did overall in 2021 and expectations for 2022? Rajan Gajaria : Hi Chris. I think like you rightly pointed out between where we were last time and where we are now, the single biggest change is glyphosate. And I think that continues to be a big part of the cost increase. That said like, Tim mentioned we do cover the glyphosate cost increases with price. We did that in 2021. And so, we feel very confident about that in '22. On freight and logistics there is an increase just based upon the inflationary cost that we are seeing there, the tightness of supply in freight etcetera. But the one element specifically I would point out is that, as supply chains become tight, we do have to plan for air freight type of things to make sure that we can get the high-margin products to the customers in time. And so that also is something that continues to evolve. From other raw material perspective, I think the increases are more or less in line with what we have said before. The inflationary trends continue. We do have some strong productivity actions with our procurement team to try and offset that, but that continues to be what we had planned for the last time we had mentioned this. So those would be some of the specific things that are driving the cost increases on the Crop Protection side Chris. Dave Anderson : And Chris was the other element of your question to make sure, I'm answering it correctly. Let me just share with you 2021. And I think we had talked about this, but just make sure we've got these correct for you. Crop Protection 2021 full year, 11% organic growth. We had price gains in every region. We had 6% volume gain. And by the way that 6% volume gain is net of nearly a 4% impact from discontinued products so pretty significant performance. And then operating EBITDA was up 20%. Margins improved more than 100 basis points. So, I think that Rajan really sets the stage as we think about 2022. And again what we talked about and reinforced was the contribution of new products $300 million in terms of our planned number of our planned number of, guidance number for new product contribution revenue in 2022. Rajan Gajaria : Absolutely. The new product portfolio continues to grow. And it will help us not only offset the cost increases, but also from a pricing opportunity creates another opportunity for us to extract value and put that to the bottom line. So completely agree there. Chris Parkinson : Yes, thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: Hi, good morning. I have a specific question on insecticides. Despite new products there, insecticide volumes were down in 4Q and for the full year. And I know that you stopped selling some low-margin products. Was that a big impact in insecticides? And then taking a step back on insecticides. I think there are new chemistries in insecticides that are becoming popular like biodegradable insecticides. And they're taking share away from older chemistries like carbonates and Chlorpyrifos. Can you talk about your portfolio and how much of that is in the older chemistries versus how much is the new chemistries? And what's the negative volume impact from the old chemistries? Thank you. Rajan Gajaria : Yeah. Hi. P.J. why don't, I take that? First and foremost, let's start with the big picture. I think if you take the products that we have discontinued like you pointed out Chlorpyrifos is one of them the low-margin products. Our insecticide business actually grew 14% year-over-year. So we have seen double-digit growth. And that continues to be a franchise that continues to do well for us. Related to the profile of the insecticide market how that is changing you're exactly right. And let me double-click on Spinosyns. And this is the world's largest selling insecticide which is naturally derived. And we are on track this year to get to about $1 billion on the Spinosyns franchise. Not only are we seeing increased volume from the capacity increases that we have built in, we continue to see price increases, and some of the productivity actions that we are taking are actually helping us even increase margins as the product continues to grow from a top line perspective. So, the Spinosyns business continues to be a big part of our portfolio. Talking about new products Isoclast comes to mind. Isoclast, again this is a product which is getting close to $300 million. And it's been a big part of what we are doing. Pyraxalt this is another product which we talk about in Asia Pacific. So the reason I'm walking you through all this is that, the patented and differentiated part of our insecticide portfolio is actually pretty large. And these are high-margin products which go through diverse crops. We have the balance that we see from natural products and products that continue to grow. So, we feel really good about the insecticide portfolio that we have. And the 14% just to underline that growth that we had despite the product phase out underlines that. And we continue to expect to see that same momentum in 2022 from a top line but more importantly margin expansion standpoint. Operator : We'll move to our next question David Begleiter at Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Chuck, you've now been CEO for three months of Corteva. What's your perspective on what Corteva does well? And what it could do better? You also mentioned some faster-paced growth going forward. Can you give a little more color on how you hope to unlock the value you highlighted? Thank you. Chuck Magro : Yeah. Thanks David. Sure. So, you're right. I've been on the job now for three months. It's been great. I've seen a lot of the operations primarily in North America. I haven't went to internationally yet because of COVID, but obviously integrating with the global team. First of all, what I'd say is, I'm quite pleased with the financial and the operating performance throughout 2021 and certainly how we ended the year. And I would say that I'm more optimistic today than when I first joined. There is significant value in this company to be delivered. We're doing that work now. It's a little early for me to give you numbers. But some of the areas that I think we need to focus on. Obviously, in this environment what we're talking about is price execution and supply chain resiliency. And I think that the company has invested a lot of force into that area. But there's probably more work we need and should be doing just like every company in that area. The other is our technology and innovation pipeline. I think it's a great asset for the organization. I think we have some wonderful future products coming out of the pipeline that's going to drive long-term value. And I'm really pleased with what I've seen so far. Then some of the remarks we've already made. So we are having a really good look at the global portfolio and what I would call the operational footprint. So, we're looking at where we make money and where we spend money, just to be candid with you. And we're unlocking -- we think there's a lot of opportunity in these areas. And we've got a team that's actively working around the clock on these issues. And it's probably a little like I said a little early to get too far ahead of this work, but we're quite excited about it. So, what we plan to do is we plan to have an Investor Day likely in the summer or late summer, where we would like to share with the world some new targets, some new financial targets, some new operating targets. We would also like to showcase the technology pipeline. I think it is going to be a great thing for the world to see what we're doing from a technology perspective. And putting on all this together what it means for long-term value creation for Corteva. So the work -- the hard work is being done now. I think there's a lot of excitement. I think that this management team is up for the challenge and the change. And we'll be back to you, probably by the summertime for our Investor Day. Operator : We'll move next to Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. A two-part question. Can you talk about how much your royalty payments decreased in 2021? And what were the factors behind that and what you expect for 2022? And secondly, your operating cash flow was higher than your EBITDA in part because you were able to elevate your level of payables by maybe $500 million year-over-year. Can you run with a much higher level of payables than you've been doing historically, so that your operating cash flow levels remain pretty high relative to EBITDA? Chuck Magro : Okay. Why doesn't Rajan take the royalty question? And Dave you can handle the operating cash flow. Dave Anderson : Sure. Chuck Magro : Go ahead, Rajan. Rajan Gajaria : Yes. Good morning, Jeff. On the royalties part we did see a step improvement in our royalty reduction in 2021. Some of that is the continued ramp-up of the Enlist portfolio. But we also had work done on the corn side with some non-assert that we've had negotiations done. So we did see a step improvement about $80 million to $90 million on royalty reductions in 2021. We are on track for our long-term royalty to making royalty neutral by the 2028, 2029 period. We see some marginal improvements in 2022, primarily continued by driving the Enlist portfolio. We are also beginning to launch Enlist in our own Corteva germplasm, which will be a further reduction of royalties in 2022. But the big step changes are going to come in from 2023. There are some offsets, where we do have some increased royalties for molecule for the traits that we use in soybeans in Latin America, et cetera. But all in all, we are on track for delivering against the commitment of being a net positive. We had a big improvement in 2021 and we'll see some changes in 2022 with step improvements 2023-odd. Dave Anderson : Yes. And Jeff I could take maybe part two of that, which \u2013 around the payables and the cash flow from operations as well as our free cash flow. So as you said, we had a lot of focus and a lot of positive that resulted from that focus in terms of our working capital initiatives in 2021. We had \u2013 as you said, we had the benefit of payables. And specifically, there we had a lot of focus around our days payables outstanding as well as our average weighted daily payment term. So that's just going to continue. The numbers that I think are really important here when we think about our 2022 guide really relates to receivables. So we had a significant benefit in terms of our receivables performance and our cash collections in 2021. We expect to continue attractive but not nearly to that level performance in 2022. That's the big variable as well as some change year-over-year in terms of the contribution from prepaid or deferred revenue, particularly in the US in the fourth quarter. So that's really the difference when you walk year-over-year in terms of our cash from operations. Cash taxes are essentially the same. Other elements in terms of the cash from operations are essentially the same. And then when you look at the free cash flow, we are forecasting slight up to $70 million uptick on our CapEx on a year-over-year basis. Chuck Magro : Yes. And Jeff just maybe a couple of comments. It's interesting how you put these two questions together. So, if you look at it from an operating perspective, what we're trying to do with royalties our new CP products, driving some of the operational work I just described, that's going to drive enhanced margins. And then Dave and his team are really focused on cash, cash management and trying to get as much of that margin into the cash as we can. And I think that there's just a tremendous opportunity here for this company to generate more cash flow. Jeff Zekauskas : Yes. Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. There's been some recent EPA commentary about Dicamba that suggests they might ban over-the-top use in 2023. If that were announced sometime in this calendar year, where do you think that would drive in less penetration in 2023? Will you have any extend left in your soybean seed platform in 2023? And those -- that old legal settlement with Bayer will there be any more payments on that after this year? Rajan Gajaria : So, Steve, this is Rajan. Nice to hear from you. Well, the Enlist franchise continues to grow. And Enlist as a system actually this year, I think, we'll be crossing $1 billion in there. And the Enlist herbicide is a big part of it. Our estimate is that Enlist system when it crosses 40% this year, more than 80% of the acres that have the Enlist system actually use the Enlist herbicide. We do have a very strong asset and a strong supply chain. So, as opportunities come up to expand Enlist, I think, we have the flexibility and capability of growing the Enlist herbicide business. Also happy to say that, we did get the seven-year registration done. Our regulatory and R&D team did a fantastic job of getting that. So the customer demand gets the confidence in the system. And so we see continued growth of where the Enlist system would go. About dicamba, we'll wait and see how the market reacts. But I think we've got the flexibility and the confidence to be able to continue to grow the Enlist system franchise. And we do have the supply chain flexibilities to grow the Enlist herbicide as the need arises. Operator : We'll move next to John Roberts with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. John Roberts : Thank you. Chuck, back to your first impressions. You bring a lot of experience in the retail channel and Corteva uses retail for pesticides and for some of the seeds like Brevant. Anything surprising in how Corteva uses retail or in the bundling programs or in the Pioneer brand's direct strategy? Chuck Magro : Yes. Hi, John. So far what I've seen -- and I've talked to all of our major retail customers and I've got lots of insight. They were very candid with me. And it was great conversations over the last I'd say two months. So look the Pioneer network I still think is a strategic asset. So I want to be clear on that. It's unique. It drives a lot of value for Corteva. And I think there's obviously things that we can do to improve it and to engage. But overall, I'm really pleased with what I've seen. But I think there is an untapped opportunity for companies like Corteva to have a deeper relationship with the retail channel. So Brevant, for example, it makes really good sense. And the retailers are asking for more choice. And they want that choice from companies that can bring real technology to them, because it helps them differentiate with their customers if they can bring differentiated technology. It's early days, but what I've seen so far is we're having -- and I'll maybe have Tim comment on some specifics for 2022. But we had a very good year in 2021 with Brevant. I think that there's good demand out there. There's a lot of energy in terms of wanting to engage with Corteva with the technology. And then beyond that I think what we can see is that our crop protection products the differentiated ones very, very strong demand from the retail channel. And is there an opportunity to have a different relationship a more strategic relationship with the retailers? Absolutely. In fact on almost every conversation that's how we ended it with -- this should not just be a commercial transaction. This needs to be much more strategic. And what that means, we need to take some time to figure it out. But I think that there's a really good opportunity here for Corteva to have deeper relationships with the retail channel, and I think that would be welcome. Maybe Tim, you can just cover what you're seeing with the retail channel in Brevant? Tim Glenn : Yes. Absolutely Chuck. And John great question. We've been talking about Brevant the US for a little while here, but we got to remember that 2021 was really the completion of our first season a business with Brevant in the US. And the good news is, we met or beat our price and volume goals that we had. One of the things we talked about and your question really goes to it is building that credibility with our channel partners. And we needed this Brevant business to not only be good for us, but also good for their business. And that is very important for us. And finally, we obviously needed to satisfy our farmer customers. The good news coming out of 2021 is we're happy with how it turned out for our business. Feedback we're getting from our channel partners is exceptional. And I had an opportunity earlier this week to meet with a couple of retail groups out of the Northern Corn Belt and got very good feedback from them on how we're doing and also product performance was outstanding. So farmers are very satisfied with how the Brevant business performed for them. So it really has translated into a much greater point of growth for our business in retail. I think over time, our objective is not to go out there and do cross-sells and things like that. It's to build these deep relationships with our retail partners on how we can go out and do good business together across both seed and crop protection and that's what's important. And as we go into 2022 year two of Brevant, we're expecting growth similar to what we had in 2021 in terms of volumes. So that's very good where we're at. And our order position supports that right now. And certainly the strong feedback, we've gotten from our channel partners supports that their enthusiasm for what we're doing there. So it is a great story for our business. And also it is a very strategic action for Corteva as we build our relationship with our distributor and retail partners. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Michael Piken : Yeah, good morning. I was hoping to get a little bit more of an update on, kind of, in South America in the back half of the year, Conkesta and your outlook for the acreage there over -- for this year and then over the next couple of years and what it might mean for incremental sales in the West herbicides as well. Chuck Magro : Tim, why don't you take that for Michael? Tim Glenn : Yeah. Michael, I mean, obviously we're still wrapping up the 2021-2022 season in Latin America and working through that and really excited about how that's gone. And looking at the 2022-2023 season here in the second half. Conkesta was an important part not necessarily from a financial or impact on our results but in terms of a big step forward in terms of a strategic initiative. And the way we positioned our Conkesta business this year was really to go out there and do this as a pilot allow our customers to get experience and get a good idea of how the technology will work in the marketplace. As we go into 2022-2023, so that crop will be planted in the second half of the season, I would still think of it in terms of that scale. And the reason is we're still introducing the technology. We're still filling out the portfolio of products that are available so farmers have a good selection of varieties that fit their needs. And also we want to get -- we want to make sure that customers have a very positive experience with the technology not just from an insect control but also weed management standpoint as you said. So we're still in that I'd say slow ramp-up phase. It's meaningful and important work for us and we're very committed to it. As we go down the road, obviously, as the portfolio fills out we'll continue to ramp that up. I think that the herbicide system, it's an important part. There's tremendous focus in Latin America and especially Brazil on insect control within soybeans. But I think our ability to position Enlist herbicide alongside that strong insect protection is going to bring new value and help differentiate Conkesta in the marketplace. So I'm sure as we go through and do our Technology Day we'll update what that growth trajectory might look like. But think about this next half of the year, it really is sort of an expansion of that pilot so that we can really get that technology well-established and understood in the marketplace. Operator : We\u2019ll move to our next question. It comes from Arun Viswanathan at RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to clarify. So it sounds like you've incorporated a $50 million currency headwind for 2022 into the guidance. Where, I guess, are you most concerned about? I know you also expressed that you potentially could have some pricing actions that would offset that. So I guess where would you think that you could actually be successful in gaining price? And maybe if you could -- to offset the currency specifically, and maybe if you could comment on channel inventories as well in certain of those regions that would be great? Thanks. Dave Anderson : Why don't I take the currency piece? And then Tim you want to talk about the channel inventory? Thank you very much. So on the currency side of it, as we said we built in a $200 million EBITDA impact when you walk the 2021 to 2022 midpoint. And significantly, it's across the range of currencies that we're exposed to. Again, it's a forecast. It also includes some of our hedged positions today, specifically, on the Brazilian real. I would say in terms of pricing, we'll look at that in every market in -- wherever we have opportunity to do so. So that will play out over the course of the year just as the currency is just a forecast today and that's going to play out over the course of the year. So it's in the mix. We also have natural hedges that are involved with some local currency expense. That will help us over the course of the year that we'll factor in into that map. So overall, we feel it's manageable. We'll do our best on all fronts. Tim, do you want to talk about the channel inventory point? Tim Glenn : Yeah, absolutely. When you look at our business in 2021, obviously, we had very strong out-the-door sales. And the focus -- it's great to be able to record those sales. But the focus of our field sales organization is to make sure that that product gets on the ground. Sell it to the distributor, have it go through the channel and ultimately get in the hands of our customers. And so we track this very closely throughout the season and as we wrap up seasons really to understand where we sit across the entire portfolio. Overall, I'd say, we feel very good about where we sit in terms of inventories in the major markets. Clearly, we're in the -- towards the tail end of the season in Latin America and Brazil, always gets a lot of interest here, and especially with the strong growth that we've seen across the board in Brazil from a crop protection standpoint. I think our belief right now is that we are seeing some increases in terms of overall industry inventory levels in Brazil and that's sort of a general statement. It's going to be probably different by segment within the market and geography within Brazil. But as we look at where we sit today, we believe that we are lower than the market overall and that we're still at a very healthy level for our business in Brazil. So in terms of the impact as we go through the season, we'll continue to track that as things ramp up and business gets completed on this part as we go to the next season, but we still feel like we're in a good spot there. In terms of other markets, I'd say inventory levels the way I'd describe it is from comfortable, meaning that there's kind of a regular or normal amount of inventory in the channel to it even being tight. We have a lot of business that's going kind of hand to mouth here. So we talked about challenges around supply. It's not just cost. It's also just getting product in the hands of our customers on a timely basis. And our teams are tremendously focused on that. So we also have segments of the markets where there's very little inventory out there, uncomfortably little inventory that we're working with. So we're watching it on a daily basis. But as we sit here right now, we do not see this as a limiting factor for our 2022 business. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Frank Mitsch at Fermium Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Thank you. As I listen to the commentary, it seems like there's a lot of positives moving over the next few years on the profit improvement side of things. So I was just wondering, you have a pristine balance sheet. Was there any thought -- and you are guiding roughly $800 million in buybacks plus or minus a couple of hundred million this year. Any thought to maybe using that pristine balance sheet and taking on a little debt and adding to the buybacks ahead of all of the profit growth that you guys are talking about? Dave Anderson : So let me just give a little perspective and then I'll turn it over to Chuck for his commentary. It's a really good question. I think to give you some perspective and we just chatted about this a little bit earlier today in terms of just looking at the math. When you look at the cash flow over the last two years Frank, you've used the midpoint of our guide for this year, the $1.450 billion that adds to $3.6 billion. So in other words, the 21.50 from 2021 combined with the midpoint of our current guidance. If you use the midpoint again of our guide, you referenced $800 million of share buyback that would sum to a total of 2.55 billion over the two years, $2.55 billion when combined with $800 million of dividends. So, $1.75 billion in share buyback, $800 million in dividend gives you the $2.55 billion, which is about 70% of the $3.6 billion. So it obviously reinforces what we've stated in terms of our commitment to return cash to shareholders. I'll let then Chuck really give a strategic lens against that backdrop. Chuck Magro : Yes. Frank, so it's a good question. And certainly, when I think about the balance sheet, it's a strategic asset. We're going to be disciplined of course, but it's -- we're going to put it to work to drive long-term shareholder value. It is clean like you mentioned. It can certainly -- when I think about the financial horsepower that this company has with the balance sheet plus what we generate from a free cash flow perspective, we have a lot of opportunity to do both, right? We're in a really positive position, where we can invest for EBITDA and margin expansion and we could return significant capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. So we're working with the Board to figure out what that formula exactly looks like. There'll be more to come on that. The other thing I'll just introduce is that, I believe that we need a good M&A capability inside of Corteva. It is something that I'm looking at quite carefully. Again, we will be disciplined. We will do M&A to drive earnings, to drive margin and ROIC. But that is something -- when we went for finished with our look at our global portfolio and how our asset footprint looks around the world. If there's some gaps, we'll either look to build it or to buy it. So, we've got just an exciting future when it comes to using, not only the operational capability, but the balance sheet that we have in the company. Operator : And that was our final question for today's call. I'll now turn the conference back to Mr. Jeff Rudolph for any additional or closing comments. Jeff Rudolph : Thank you. That concludes today's call. The Investor Relations team is here for your follow-up questions, so we look forward to those. We thank you for your interest in Corteva and wish you a great day. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And again ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. You may disconnect at this time and have a great day.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Magro : Thanks, Jeff. And thank you for joining us on the call and webcast today. Corteva delivered a solid start to the year with double-digit sales and earnings growth in the quarter. Despite pressure from ongoing inflation and supply chain challenges, the team delivered impressive value creation. Every region delivered double-digit organic sales gains led by strong demand for advantage technologies. Further, the company continued to drive penetration of our leading pipeline with new crop protection product sales of approximately $480 million, a nearly 60% increase over prior year. This was led by products like the Enlist soybean system, which continues to gain traction in the market, given superior performance and grower confidence. And we expect to be on at least 40% of the U.S. soybean acres in 2022. We are encouraged by the current ag market backdrop and the overall financial health of the farmer. Market demand is solid, evident by the strong position of our order book and growers are investing in their crop through top technology to maximize yield. We expect these trends to continue through out the year, given current commodity prices and the fact that productivity on the farm from top tier seed genetics in yield advantage Corteva products is the best way to manage inflation. Despite robust customer demand, we continue to experience increasing global macroeconomic uncertainty. Similar to 2021, supply chain challenges due to labor shortages, logistical constraints and COVID-19 impact are leading to further inflationary trends. This is compounded by the rise of global energy prices, which is adding to the volatility of raw material availability and prices. Given that we are still early in the growing season in the Northern Hemisphere and the significance of the first half in the agricultural industry. We are maintaining our guidance at this point. In addition, through our significant global macroeconomic and geopolitical considerations, all of this is against the backdrop of strong ag market fundamentals. And we remain constructive on the year and will provide an update on guidance as the year progresses. Turning to the work we kicked off earlier in the year on accelerating the operational performance of the company. In the quarter, we announced that we are moving from a matrix organization to a global business unit model to drive overall simplicity and speed of business while increasing accountability. We have two great global leaders to run these businesses and extract the value potential we see in our premium technologies. Tim Glenn, who is an ag veteran with tremendous experience to capture the value of our market-leading seed franchise. And I'm excited to welcome Robert King to Corteva, given the experience he will bring to the crop protection business to maximize our operational effectiveness in growth potential. This was a critical step for the company, as it now allows these leaders to focus on optimizing the business and operational structure to maximize the customer experience and deliver on growth and earnings potential. This will include prioritizing the product portfolios, the markets we serve and how we go to market. This will also include optimizing all support costs. This work is well underway and we will provide updates in the near future on our progress. Now let's go to Slide 5, where I'd like to provide our insights on the ag market outlook. As I said, in my opening, ag fundamentals remain strong despite recent market volatility. We expect record demand for grains and oil seeds in 2022, which we believe will keep commodity prices at elevated levels. And we expect this trend to continue for at least the next few years as ending stocks will remain under pressure. Recent volatility has increased due to several factors surrounding production, including the impact on global food supply from Russia's war on Ukraine. This region is vital to providing grain and oil seeds to the world, including countries where food security is critical, leading to further pressure on an already tight global food system. Corteva recently announced our decision to exit Russian operations while also committing to donate commercial seed to countries affected by these issues to help ease food security risk, whether is another factor impacting production in key markets like Brazil and the U.S. Dry conditions in Brazil have led to yield and seed production impacts, which in turn impacts supply in that market and keep seed availability tight. Despite a slow start to the planting season in the U.S., which shifted some U.S. seed deliveries into the second quarter, farmers are very motivated to get the crop in the ground. We are also seeing for the third time in recorded history, soybean acres outpaced corn acres. Dave will provide more details on this later. Grower balance sheets and income levels remain healthy despite increased input costs for fuel and fertilizer. This is leading to customers prioritizing technology for 2022 to maximize return. And Corteva is in a good position to capitalize on this opportunity. And with that, let me turn it over to Dave to provide details on the quarter and the outlook. Dave Anderson : Thanks, Chuck, and welcome everyone to the call. Let's start on Slide 6, which provides the financial results for the quarter. As Chuck said, as you can see from the numbers, we've started the year strong. 2021 organic sales increased 16% with gains in both segments and all regions. Global pricing was up 9% with notable increases in seed and crop protection. Crop protection volume growth was driven by strong early demand in North America and the strength of new products, which delivered approximately $180 million of sales growth year-over-year. We delivered more than $1 billion in operating EBITDA on the quarter of 15% increase from the same period last year. This is impressive performance given higher costs incurred in the quarter as a result of inflation. Pricing and productivity more than offset this expected impact as well as an approximate $160 million currency headwind driven by the Turkish Lira and the Euro. This improvement translated into almost 100 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year. Going to Slide 7, you can see the broad based growth with double-digit organic sales in every region. In North America, organic sales were up 15% driven by crop protection on early demand for herbicides, including Enlist. Seed volumes were down versus prior year, primarily due to seasonal timing of U.S. Pioneer brand corn deliveries, both segments delivered notable pricing gains, a testament to the demand for our technology in our ability to price for higher input costs. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, organic sales increased 12% compared to prior year driven by strong price execution. Local pricing helped to mitigate currency impacts, which was a 13% headwind in the region due again to the Turkish lira and the euro. Demand remains high for new and differentiated products, including Arylex herbicide and Inatreq fungicide driving 6% crop protection volume growth year-over-year. The region overall performed well in the quarter, despite the war in Ukraine that started in late February. Speaking of Ukraine, demand was strong in military free areas for both crop protection and seeds. We did experience some supply constraints in the country due to logistical challenges of importing product. Our local teams were resilient. They were committed to deliver products and support our customers when able to do so. Farmers continue to plant crops and per local estimates, we expect more than 70% of Ukraine\u2019s spring crops will be planted. In Latin America, we delivered 26% organic growth with double digit volume and price gains. Pricing increased 12% compared to prior year driven by our price for value strategy, coupled with increases to offset rising input costs. Seed volumes increased 11% despite tight supply driven by Brazil safrinha, while crop protection volumes increased 16% on demand for new products, including Isoclast insecticide. Asia Pacific organic sales were up 22% over prior year on both volume and price gains. Seed volumes increased 49% on the recovery of corn planted area from last year\u2019s COVID-related impacts. Crop protection organic growth of 13% was led by continued demand for new and differentiated products, including Rinskor herbicide and Zorvec fungicide. Let\u2019s now move to Slide 8 for a detailed review of operating EBITDA performance. First quarter operating EBITDA increased by $130 million to over $1 billion, as that previously covered strong customer demand drove broad-based organic growth with price and volume gains in all regions. On costs, we incurred approximately $200 million of market driven cost headwinds in the quarter driven by higher seed commodity costs, crop protection raw material costs as well as freight and logistics. The company realized $80 million in productivity savings in the quarter, which helped to partially offset this impact. Currency was $160 million headwind again, primarily driven by the Turkish lira and the euro. Setting back, focused execution by the organization to meet increased customer demand and effectively managing cost headwinds through pricing and productivity resulted in almost 100 basis points of margin improvement for the quarter. Let\u2019s go now to Slide 9, I\u2019d like to expand a little bit more on what we\u2019re observing in the current marketplace. Starting with our current planted area assumptions, we are aligned with USDA estimates for a 4 million acre reduction in corn, or approximately a 4% decline and a corresponding increase in soybean acreage. Additionally, on planted area assumptions, an important reminder, 1 million acre shift in the market from corn to soybeans in the U.S. represents an approximate $10 million earnings headwind to Corteva. And as Chuck mentioned, we\u2019re closely monitoring the pace of planting given the slow start in the U.S. Inflation remains a challenge as we face pressure from rising costs in commodities, energy and raw materials, operational levers, such as pricing and productivity actions are key for us to keep pace with these higher costs. And as you saw, the company recently announced plans to stop production and operations in Russia. Russia represents approximately 2% of total Corteva annual revenue with approximately 75% of that in the Seed segment. For 2022, we expect an immaterial impact from lost revenue. In addition, we expect charges in the range of $25 million to $75 million in connection with this decision with the majority to be treated as a significant item, therefore, will not be included in our operating results. Currency markets have been volatile to start the year as we saw relatively broad appreciation of the U.S. dollar. An exception of that is the recent strengthening of the Brazilian real. Looking at the second half of the year, the Brazilian real is our largest foreign currency exposure. And while we\u2019ve largely hedged the BRL with a rate around 5.50, we do have some sensitivity to currency movements and would see a partial benefit from a strengthen BRL. Now, given this backdrop, let\u2019s turn to the discussion regarding our outlook. As Chuck covered earlier, we\u2019re affirming our full year revenue and earnings guidance for 2022. And as shared last quarter, we expect net sales for the year in the range of $16.7 billion to $17 billion. And we\u2019re likely trending towards the higher end of the range. For the first half, we expect high single digit reported revenue growth. Turning to EBITDA. We remain on track to deliver between $2.8 billion and $3 billion, a 13% increase over prior year at the midpoint. For the first half, we expect mid single digit operating EBITDA growth given the disproportionate waiting of cost headwinds recognized in the first half. And lastly, we\u2019re adjusting our operating EPS guidance to arrange of $2.35 per share to $2.55 per share, represents approximately 14% growth over prior year at the midpoint. This increase is largely driven by anticipated lower share count due to the good start we\u2019ve had in the first quarter on share repurchases. Let\u2019s go now to Slide 10. I want to leave you with some of the important takeaways from today\u2019s call. First of course, market demand is strong and combined with solid execution, it\u2019s led to a great start for Corteva, including impressive margin expansion in the quarter. We remain confident in our ability to deliver 2022. We plan to maintain our track record on capital deployment. We expect to return more than $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2022 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, our balance sheet provides capacity for attractive innovation and targeted growth opportunities. Finally, the company has taken very important steps in its strategic roadmap to accelerate operational performance and drive continued operating EBITDA margin expansion. More to come on this, and we believe these strategies will further differentiate Corteva and position us to deliver increased value in years to come. And finally, on Slide 11, we\u2019d like to provide an update about a significant upcoming event. We\u2019re excited to announce that our 2022 Investor Day will be held on September 13 at our Global Business and R&D Center in Johnston, Iowa. The management team will provide updates on the company\u2019s strategy, our financial framework, along with a special showcase on innovation in our pipeline. Chuck, Tim, Robert, Sam, and I all look forward to seeing as many of you as possible at this event in September. And with that, let me turn the call back to Jeff. Jeff Rudolph : Thank you, Dave. Now let\u2019s move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Just wondering if you can talk a bit more about the seed business and help us bridge 1Q with 2Q to kind of get to an understanding of how the first half or the overall season is going to play out. So maybe to start with the volume pushout from 1Q to 2Q because of the late season, how did that impact margins in the first quarter? And how it will impact margins in the second quarter and where do you envision that the first half settling out? And then secondly, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re looking for less corn and maybe more soy at this point, depending on what happens over the next couple of weeks. But if that the case and that was baked into guidance now. And then lastly, how should we think about the corn and seed pricing in the U.S. for 1H is what we saw in the first quarter, corn up 6% and soy looked like it was probably negative. Is that what the first half is going to look like? Or it\u2019ll be a little bit better or a little bit worse. Thanks. Chuck Magro : Good morning, Vincent. Thanks for the question. So look, let me give you a couple opening comments and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Tim to talk about your specifics around the split between Q1 and Q2, first half, second half. We\u2019re sitting here today in our headquarters in Indianapolis. We\u2019ve been here all week. It\u2019s cool and it\u2019s wet. Probably no surprise to many that\u2019s been watching the weather. But certainly it\u2019s been a slower start to this season than last year. That is impacting our results when it comes to the seed business, certainly for quarter, because of some weather delays here in North America, but also in Europe. We\u2019ve got significant market volatility in terms of pricing and the planting decisions that farmers need to make are being impacted by the weather. So Tim will walk you through the dynamics. We did mention in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve got a strong \u2013 a very strong order book, and Tim can walk you through that. I just want to remind though, the group here though, that if you look at the longer-term value catalyst that we have, the Enlist seed platform is really performing very well beyond our expectations. We did say we expect 40% of the U.S. acres to be on that platform. And that will set us up nicely next year for meaningful royalty reductions in 2023. And then just the call out Bravante our new multi-channel technology, it continues to perform very well. We\u2019ve got very good demand across the channel in that we are now selling it in North America, Latin America and Europe. And that is exceeding expectations as well. So now I\u2019ll just turn it over to Tim to talk a little bit about the dynamics we\u2019re seeing here in the first \u2013 we saw in the first quarter and what we expect in the second quarter and the remainder of the year. Go ahead, Tim. Tim Glenn : All right. Thanks, Chuck and good morning, Vincent. So maybe I\u2019ll address three points you made there. First is around just the pace of the season in the U.S. Second is pricing and I\u2019ll touch on the seed margins and what we\u2019re seeing there. So, obviously, as you mentioned and Chuck said, we\u2019re out to a slower that we\u2019d like in terms of the pace of planting across North America, really and it\u2019s wet, cool conditions that have driven that. That was reflected in our first quarter seed sales where we saw some pioneer business that did not make it into the marketplace. Remember, how we recognize revenue is we distribute all that seed to our local sales representatives. They deliver that last mile to the farm gate when the farmer needs it. And that\u2019s when we recognize the revenue. So it was that last mile to the farm gate that was the issue as we had challenging weather conditions at the end of March. So, what I would emphasize here is that there still is more than adequate time to get this crop planted. And the economics that farmers are seeing are still very strong. And so whether they\u2019re going to plant corn, whether they\u2019re going to plant soybeans, whether they\u2019re going to plant cotton, there\u2019s a strong incentive for them to, to get that crop in the ground. And at this point in time, we\u2019re not seeing a switch between corn and soy in terms of farmers switching the crop they intend to plant. The other thing I\u2019d emphasize is that farmers have a tremendous capacity to plant. And so it\u2019s not unusual when we get into planting season for farmers to be able to plant 40% of a specific state in the matter of seven days. And so I think as the weather starts to open up here, we\u2019re going to see huge push forward in terms of planting activity. And so from that standpoint, what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re staying close to our customers, helping them navigate the decisions that they\u2019re facing in the marketplace, so that they can make the best choice for their operations and we\u2019re there to help meet their needs. In terms of pricing, we did have a strong start to the year, both globally and within North America. And in the first quarter we saw global seed prices up around 8%, corn around 8% and actually global soy was around 6%. So we had good solid start for the year on pricing. And we anticipate that to continue through the first half. We\u2019re looking at solid mid single digit growth in the first half that we\u2019ll see that go forward. And again, farmers have been motivated to plant the best products they possibly can, high performing hybrids in the case of seed. And we\u2019ve got an excellent lineup of products. And clearly, I would also emphasize, we\u2019ve got a long disciplined approach for managing price with our customers. And I think have a proven ability to execute in the field to capture value. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re at on pricing. So very optimistic and I think consistent with what our expectations were as we started the year. In terms of seed margins, what we\u2019ve seen is clearly some margin compression on the seed side. And I\u2019d say most of those headwinds we had expected as we came into the year. In terms of those headwinds first, we had a higher than expected currency primarily out of Europe about $90 million at the EBITDA level on seed. And that was primarily from the Turkish lira as well as the euro. We also did have that impact on margins that I discussed a little bit earlier due to the weather impacts a little bit less corn sold in the first quarter. And again, especially on the pioneer side in North America. And finally, the other factor is really unrelated to the operations. And we had about 100 basis point impact from an equity adjustment on an investment that we hold, so completely non-related to the operations of the business. And I guess, I\u2019d pass it over to Dave and anything you want to add in terms of that equity holding. Dave Anderson : Yes. Those are all really, really good points, Tim. And by the way, just back on that currency, you stated dollar terms. But Vincent for your benefit and everybody, it\u2019s over 200 basis points when you do the walk. Now some of that, obviously we expected in the course of our guide for the year. But incrementally, that turned out to be significant. So regarding the equity investment, we had a loss in the quarter of mark-to-market on a \u2013 this compares to first quarter of 2021 that represented an impact of almost $30 million or as Tim said about 100 basis points. The company that where we\u2019ve held an investment technology based and have had it for over six to seven years and IPO-ed in the third quarter of 2021. So we\u2019re on a mark-to-market accounting now. So that\u2019s really the background on that. Appreciate the question. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Dave Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Dave Begleiter : Thank you. Chuck and Dave, I think you guided Q2 being a little bit below consensus, referring the full year. So what\u2019s the offset in the back half you guys coming in maybe a little bit better than we expected for you guys. Chuck Magro : Yes. David, let me give you the backdrop on sort of our position on guidance and Dave can talk to the specifics. So look, the ag fundamentals, as we said, are very strong. And I think Corteva has had a real solid start to the year and demand, we are expecting to continue to be strong through the remainder of this year and well into 2023. The other thing we like is the execution of the overall business is now \u2013 our execution has been steady despite the supply chain challenges, the cost pressures we\u2019ve outlined. And I think we\u2019re making excellent progress in cost management pricing and productivity actions that we\u2019re taking. But it is early. We\u2019re sitting here in the early days of May, the season\u2019s a little later than last year. And in ag you have to obviously think about the first half. So what we\u2019re doing right now is we\u2019re reaffirming the guidance. We\u2019re very comfortable. We like how the season\u2019s unfolding. And now to get to your specific question on sort of how we think about that range and what we think may or may not happen. I\u2019ll let Dave kind of give the specifics. Dave Anderson : Yes. I think probably the starting point is what we shared on the call, which is consistent with what we originally provided by way of the 2022 guide, which is given the \u2013 call it the slope of the cost curve over the course of 2021. What we\u2019re seeing is that those costs ramped and particularly by the way into the second quarter of this year, we see that ramping, accelerating a bit and that\u2019s built into our guides. So on a year-over-year basis, we see the first half revenue, like we said, high single digits growth, but EBITDA more in the range of mid single digits growth. Again, that\u2019s consistent with the guide that we\u2019ve provided to you \u2013 provided to you previously. And that relationship is again, just related to the comps in terms of the period over period, or year-over-year change, particularly on the cost curve that we\u2019ve seen. Now the second half appears to be setting up pretty nicely. And that\u2019s included in our full year guide in the range. I would say that our expectation is we\u2019re likely to be at the high end of the revenue range. And that\u2019s again, reflective of what we see and anticipate in terms of ongoing inflation and pricing to offset those cost impacts. And despite those inflation headwinds, we anticipate to be in that range again, that we guided to in terms of the full year EBITDA. The other thing of course we\u2019re seeing is Brazil planted area improvement. Tim referenced that a little bit when he was talking about seed. And Tim, you may want to comment a little bit more about Brazil. But that Brazil planted area is clearly also something that\u2019s positive for us when we look at the second half of the year. Tim, any comments you would want to add on that? Tim Glenn : No, I think Dave you\u2019re right. Clearly there\u2019s strong incentive for continued growth in the soy area in Brazil, and we expect that possibly at the expense of first crop corn, but we expect that second crop corn, which is the largest market and most important market in Brazil right now to grow nicely as we go into the 2023 cycle. So very positive about what the outlook is there. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Chris Parkinson with Mizuho. Chris Parkinson : Great. Thank you so much. When you take a step back on your CP business and you look at the growth of \u2013 some of the higher margin, newer products, Arylex, Rinskor, Zorvec so on and so forth. And then also the pricing you\u2019re getting in the vast majority of your geographies. Can you just give us a little bit more perspective on how you\u2019re \u2013 obviously you\u2019re still facing some inflationary pressures now. But can you give us a little bit more perspective on how you\u2019re thinking about the intermediate to long-term margin profile of that business? Thank you. Chuck Magro : Good morning, Chris. Yes, I\u2019ll have Robert comment on the specifics and we\u2019re very pleased with the trajectory that we\u2019re on, so maybe just the few high level comments. So the CP business this quarter, we saw strength basically across the board. And it\u2019s really from customer demand really asking around the latest technology, the new products to drive productivity on the farm. So one of the best ways that farmers can help offset the inflationary pressure they\u2019re seeing on the farm is to drive productivity. And with that, they\u2019re going to need technology. And our pipeline, as we\u2019ve talked about is growing quite rapidly with our new products. And so when we look at it, we think what\u2019s happening in our business is you\u2019re starting to see and it\u2019s early days, but you\u2019re starting to see the impact of our new product portfolio on our bottom line. And Robert will talk to the specifics. The other thing that I\u2019ll just call out is later this year we will bring up our new Spinosyns capacity late this year. And so you\u2019ll start to see the impact of that incremental capacity and of course, margin that will follow with it late this year and into 2023. So we like the setup in the portfolio for the CP business, and that\u2019s what I think you\u2019re starting to see in the results. Now when you think about the inflationary response and how we manage price, but I\u2019d also say productivity in that business. I\u2019ll turn it over to Robert. Robert King : Yes. Thanks Chuck. Just getting started overall, we do see high demand strength across the board for our technology. Supply chain held up \u2013 this quarter held up very well, actually, moving more than 18% of volume on a year-over-year basis. And that\u2019s an unprecedented headwind. So we\u2019re able to keep up and do a good job across the board. The new products that you mentioned there were up 60% over year-over-year basis. And we really see that that\u2019s the value create that from our new technologies that the growers want to see. As we look into \u2013 as we continue to look forward and for the first quarter, pricing gains across the regions really reflect our ability to use price and productivity to offset higher costs. We\u2019re confident we\u2019ll continue to see these things as we move forward into the rest of the year and with a good start of the year. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Last quarter you provided a helpful bridge to your 2022 annual EBITDA versus 2021. And I imagine you may not be in a position to update every item every single quarter. But nevertheless, can you provide some thoughts on three bridge items your productivity goal, your net foreign exchange as it\u2019s tracking today, and then the cost headwinds that you foresee in both seeding crop protection for the year. Dave Anderson : Yes. Kevin, I can give you a little bit there. I may ask you given the list that you just went through, I may ask for a little bit of a reminder of each item that you had on that. But let me talk a little bit about the bridge and the update on the bridge. I mentioned that just a little bit earlier, it\u2019s sort of embedded in what we\u2019ve assumed in our guide. I think the most important thing is the fact that that we see inflation continuing, and that impact is going to be particularly felt in terms of our costs. It\u2019s going to be particularly felt on the crop protection side. So the assumption is in the guide that we\u2019ve given you is that we expect to be at the higher end our revenue range. So that $16.7 billion closer to the $17 billion in terms of the full year outlook, it\u2019s really based on inflation and then pricing. So, that\u2019s really sort of fundamental. So if you looked at that EBITDA bridge, it\u2019s really those two items that are increased on a prior guide to now update here at the end of the first quarter. Second, with regard to foreign currency, as we mentioned, we had fairly significant impact to foreign currency. If you look at the total Corteva, as you know, it was about 225 basis points of impact in the first quarter. Currency is going to abate to some degree as a percent as an impact as we go through the year. And there\u2019s two things there. One is just, again, the comparables compared to the prior period, which get a little bit easier on the currency side. And the second thing is that we have some potential for improvement on the BRL, the Brazilian real compared to our assumption. We\u2019re hedge currently at 5.50 in the second half. As you know the real is closer to 5.0. I think it\u2019s a little bit below 5.0 today in terms of where it is trading. So we have some potential upside there against what we\u2019ve \u2013 against what we\u2019ve assumed. And then on the cost piece, I think it was a third component of what you asked about. And let me say two things that I think are very important. Number one, again and Robert emphasized this and his response to the earlier question is that we are \u2013 because of our advantage technologies, we are able to price against the costs that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace. That\u2019s very, very important. And we expect, again, those costs headwinds to continue over the course of the year. Second thing I would mention on the cost side is the productivity that we\u2019re seeing on the SG&A. I mean, wage inflation is in the headlines everywhere today. We\u2019re experiencing the same kinds of pressures. The reality is, you\u2019ll see this in the financial backup to our earnings release, the SG&A, we\u2019ve been able to hold flat on a period over period basis, which is I think quite impressive. Despite by the way, underlying bad debt accrual increases, we normalize that over a very favorable set of conditions in 2021. So that\u2019s the other thing that you should be aware of. It\u2019s not just the \u2013 let\u2019s call it cost of goods sold management that we\u2019re doing both productivity as well as pricing to offset inflation impacts. We\u2019re also managing if you will, the below the line to support costs as we look over the course of 2022. And by the way, something that we think is also going to serve us well, as we set up for 2023. So thanks for the questions. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to PJ Juvekar with Citi. Patrick Cunningham : Hi. This is Patrick Cunningham on for PJ. Good morning, everyone. So with the current run up in corn prices, what does that mean for your seed costs next year and pricing next year, given that this season\u2019s pricing was fixed back in the fall? And also how much of your corn production is hedged for next year? Thanks. Chuck Magro : Tim, do you want to take that? Tim Glenn : Yes, I will. So obviously we\u2019re worried about getting the last 85% of this season\u2019s crop in the ground. But we are working hard on 2023. So in terms of COGS, obviously price is one of the most important factors that impact seed COGS. And so we're looking closely at that right now and there is clearly going to be a headwind on a year-over-year basis. There's no question about it. And it's not as simple as saying the commodity prices were X and now they're Y and extrapolating that because there are a number of factors, including the hedging approach that we have that have an impact on that. So we're in the process sizing that up and I would say we\u2019re probably not prepared to share what that increase would be but we're working on that as well. And in terms of how we manage that, we're in the early stages of putting together our total plan for 2023. So the commercial organization is finalized what the mix of products are that we're going to be bringing to the market in 2023. We\u2019re in the process of planting our seed crop for this year that will be in the market in 2023. And obviously, we're in the same situation as farmers in terms of wanting to get that in the ground. And finally, we're developing our market offer in terms of price and programs and so very way too preliminary to get into the specifics around that. Underlying, we continue to expect there to be favorable economics for our farmer customers. And so demand for premium products is going to continue to be high. We also do have a strong record of capturing value for our technology. And so we have products that growers want and we have strong execution in the field and we know that our \u2013 the levers \u2013 the key levers that we have to deal with those escalating commodity prices, clearly productivity is a big part of that. And we're constantly working to get the most efficient operations we can, but also pricing. And again, we're working on sizing that up. We're confident that as we go into 2023, we will be able to cover our cost headwinds in terms of commodity, either through productivity or pricing, and that it will be accretive to our underlying margins for seed. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Alex Chen : Hi, this is Alex Chen on for Joel Jackson. Thanks for taking my question. With respect to higher crop prices and inflation, how are you seeing farmers demand change with respect to crop chemicals? Are there any particular buckets of products, demand is seeing stronger/weaker trends and maybe why? And if you can maybe elaborate on when you expect costs to fund out for crop protection. Thanks. Chuck Magro : Hi, Alex. Good morning. We'll ask Robert King to answer that question for you. Robert King : Yes, Alex, thanks for the question. When you look at our portfolio and what we're doing, you're beginning to see the new products starting to show up in the marketplace. And that technology is again is being something that's adding value to the farm gate. So it helps our farmers be much more productive. So in terms of what would we see moving forward, we're working heavily on the robust pipeline to continue to move this forward. As Chuck mentioned earlier, our Spinosyns manufacturing is under expansion and we'll finish about 50% capacity increase there as well. So overall, we're going to continue to balance this thing moving forward with price and productivity for the rest of the year in the crop protection area. Tim, you may want to add a few things for seed. Tim Glenn : No, I think just to build off that Robert, I mean, clearly we got a very strong preference for customers, again, the products that are going to make them money and we always have a strong mix, it's on the premium side and I think that's reinforced here. The other element that we're looking at as we go into 2023 is, what's the mix of crops that are going to be planted as well. And we would anticipate that that'll continue to shift as we go into 2023 and will be somewhat dependent upon what ultimately gets planted in 2022, but also what's produced in other parts of the world. So we're going to look heavily at that. And as you sit here today, you would say that the mix for 2023 is maybe favoring corn a little bit more than what we saw as we came into 2022. Chuck Magro : Yes and just Alex on this backdrop. So look, we said that the fundamentals are going to be quite strong. Really, if you look at crop commodity prices, what it's telling us is that the world needs to produce more food. So we not only need \u2013 we're talking about a mix here, which is important, but we need more acreage to be put into production. And then of course, we need technology to drive productivity yield on every acre we have.  And so, there seems to be a shift underway to take the top technology in terms of genetics and traits for seed. And then of course, the top technologies in CP to drive every last bushel per acre, we think that this will continue. If you look at farmer economics around the world things are quite robust. Farmers are in a good financial position. In fact, if you look at the U.S. farmers, the predictions are that this year would be a record revenue year for U.S. farmers. And I believe the second most profitable in the last decade. So there's high motivation as Tim mentioned to get that crop in the ground and then to protect and grow that crop and I think what you're going to see that, that we're very well positioned as an integrated company to catalyze it on that trend, but also to help farmers drive productivity sustainably. Dave Anderson : Chuck, maybe just one other thing, Robert, maybe just one other thing and then sort of embedded in our responses, part of the question obviously had to do with the cost and over time inflation outlook, our expectation when you look at the leading indicators, all of those are pointing to continued inflation. So we're not counting on some kind of meaningful abatement anytime soon. And one of the things that Robert is obviously in his team is very focused on is the resiliency of our supply chain. And I have to say in any metrics that we've looked at any comparative data that we've looked at ours ranks very strong. And we're seeing that in terms of delivery, in terms of the results that we're achieving as well, particularly when you think about all the geopolitical pressure and other things are going on in the world. So that's also underlying in terms of what we're focused on. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Yes, would like to drill into seeds a little bit more here. You reported your corn seed price of 6% or 8% and soybean up 6%. And given your Pioneer business, you would know exactly what your customers are ordering. So my question for you would be how much of that eight and six, or maybe a zero just on North America. But how much of that would you say is like-for-like price increase versus a mix shift up the price card, are you seeing your customers change the genetics of what they're planting a little more than they have in the past? Would you expect them to perhaps do even more of that in 2023? And then one quick, when your EMEA corny pricing gains were pretty significant, can you just comment on how much of that seed business is transgenic? Tim Glenn : Yes, Steve, thanks for the question. So in terms of mix of products, what I would say is the price level we're capturing is very similar to we would have taken to the marketplace in terms of our price card movement as we came into the year. So I guess two parts of the question in terms of North America, is there a major shift in terms of the trait mix? And I would say generally not, you have these modest shifts on a year-to-year basis in terms of our trait mix, question on genetics, absolutely farmers are always looking to plant new and better genetics. And so typically think about our turnover every year in our lineup, we have 20% to 25% of our seed lineup would be new and improved genetics. And as Chuck said, as Dave said, that productivity that farmers are striving for in their operations, largely that's going to come from those new and improved genetics. So I'd say that is clearly something we're seeing this year, but we see that every year, just because it's that pursuit of that next level of productivity. So it is a great start to the year, I think very consistent what we expected. And I wouldn't say that it was mix driven. It was really driven by the fact that we came out with a strong lineup of high performing products. And we were able to capture the value and feel very good about where we sit there, in terms of Europe specifically on the price side, very limited seed in EMEA would be transgenic, very small amount in Spain would be transgenic. So that is nearly all non-transgenic seed. And again, the same dynamic around new and improved genetics is at work there. I would tell you to some extent, Europe is a little bit impacted because the Turkish Lira and so you're getting a little bit more pricing there because we're aggressively pricing that severe devaluation that we faced in Turkey and so that's skewing the numbers in Europe a little bit there, but the same approach to capturing value for our high performing genetics is very good. And we feel good as we roll out of North America and move into the rest of the world for the rest of 2022, that we're going to continue to see that caught mid single-digit, good, strong mid single-digit growth on seed throughout the year. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Michael Piken : Hey, good morning. Just want to dig a little bit deeper on the soybean side. You mentioned that Enlist might be about 40% of the acres. I'm curious what percentage of those acres are actually going to be sprayed with Enlist herbicides. And then secondarily, if you could talk about how the transition toward Pioneer bread and Enlist genetics is going for this year and what your target is for next year? Thanks. Chuck Magro : Yes. Great question. And let me take, so we're still really excited about the adoption of the system. And I would say as we sit here today, again, with a relatively small amount of the crop planted, we're holding to that original guide around at least 40% of the U.S. soy acres will be planted with an Enlist E3 variety. So that holds steady and why we can't update that right now is we only have so much visibility to what the 100 licensees are in the marketplace, what they're ultimately selling, and we'll have a much better understanding of what ultimately when in the ground is we get past the midyear and after the planting season. So feel good about that in terms of the adoption of the Enlist herbicide and really getting the full value of the system. We're over 80% treated with the Enlist herbicide, so really high utilization. And again, I think that goes to the value that customers are seeing. So it's three seasons really into Enlist E3 soybeans. And we can confidently say, when you look at the seed adoption, as well as utilization of the chemistry, it's become a very trusted option for growers and growers see it as a go-to option. And we don't see that slowing down. Your question around genetics and where we're headed here, I mean, this is going to be a really important season for us and we're going to be doing extensive demonstration trials of a new class of Corteva developed E3 varieties that we anticipate ramping up for 2023. So the question is \u2013 your point is when are you going to see it, I think you're going to start to see that in terms of demonstration in 2023 or 2022 in the field in anticipation of a significant move in 2023. And again, once we get through the planning season, we'll be in a better position to update that 40% number for planting of E3 seed, but feel very comfortable that, that we'll be at least at that level and again, at that high utilization on the chemistry system. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Joshua Spector with UBS. Lucas Beaumont : Good morning. This is Lucas Beaumont on for Josh. So I just wanted to go back to crop protection pricing a bit if we could. So I mean, yours has accelerated kind of double digits. I mean, in the market more generally, we're seeing fragmentation sort of where certain products are up, like very significantly and others more modestly in the normal kind of mid single-digit range. Can you discuss sort of the mix and pricing you're seeing across your portfolio, and then just how you think the overall CPC pricing will evolve through the rest of 2022? So I guess, just lastly like, when are you kind of expecting pricing to peak now this year, given it's already quite elevated? So, I mean, do you think it will accelerate or decelerate kind of into the fourth quarter and sort of roughly what you think your exit rate will be? Thank you. Robert King : Yes, Lucas, this is Robert. Thanks for the question. Yes, we did have a good start in Q1 and thanks for recognizing the margins. As you look at where we are, and as we're moving forward here, we're in improvement process, our new products are starting to show up. We just talked about quite a bit and this mix is helping us not only with the farm productivity, but with the value that you're seeing and it's getting pulled forward. When you begin to look at the rest of the year, we do expect to have some headwinds. And as you know, in the crop protection, our business will shift to the South into Latin America. So their mix would be a little bit different, but we've got new products coming on like the Spinosyns we talked about earlier. And we think that some of these things are going to help improve our offerings around the world and specifically into Latin America. So we're going to continue to balance inflation with cost increases of \u2013 with price and productivity to help offset those. And overall, we expect margin to hold across the year. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Hey, good morning. Looking forward to Iowa in September, for sure. And since last conference call, you guys have made the move to one single headquarter in Indianapolis, you've spoken about the new organizational structure and also mentioned that optimizing the costs \u2013 support costs and so forth. And so I was wondering if you could kind of size how we should be thinking about the productivity improvements for the company, sort of how the pace of that layers in over this year and next year? Chuck Magro : Yes. Hi, Frank. So let me give you where we are. I'm probably not going to answer your question directly today. You need to come to Johnston, Iowa, and you'll get that answer in September, but let me just kind of frame the journey that we've been on. So look, I said this before, when I started with the organization, but overall I'm very pleased with the strategic direction of Corteva. I do believe that the company is quite uniquely positioned when you look at our products and our brand portfolio, the innovation pipeline, but more than the innovation pipeline, the science and innovation competencies and capabilities that we have in Johnston and here in Indianapolis. And then of course, Tim mentioned it today. Our customer and channel reach is truly unprecedented. So the work that we're focused on right now is really, we're going to provide a little bit more clarity in September on the strategic direction, but I'd say it's tweaking. It's really clarity around what we will focus on and what we won't focus on. We're going to try to really \u2013 with the organizational changes we've made to move to two global business units. We're really trying to drive accountability into our culture, streamlining and simplifying the product portfolio will be the next effort.  So that effort is well underway right now, we're looking at the global portfolio, we're looking at where we operate around the world and we're trying to make the decisions on how do we enhance performance and drive speed of business. And so that work is progressing very nicely. And by the time, we get to the September Investor and Innovation session that we're planning, we'll be able to give you at least a view on the operational and financial journey that we believe the company will be on. And by that point, we will have made some other decisions. And then of course, the important part of September will be and the reason we're having it at Johnston is we'd like to demonstrate some of our technology. We're very proud of what we've been able to build over the last several years. And I think it's time that we sort of start sharing more of that with our stakeholders. So stay tuned. Operator : Our last question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Chuck Magro : Arun \u2013 maybe operator, you can go to the next, is there another question. We can\u2019t hear Arun. Operator : Okay. We'll go to our next caller from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So maybe coming back to me earlier discussion on Enlist and the move of that into the higher end Pioneer, Germplasm. Can you just help us think about \u2013 so the market share for the higher end Pioneer Germplasm where it sits today? Has that been something where maybe there's been a little bit of loss of market share because it has the extend trade in it that you're no longer prioritizing and that is going to see a pretty meaningful shift next year. And just how we think about rebuilding the market share for your own Germplasm and soy, that includes the Enlist trait moving forward. Chuck Magro : Yes. So Adam, good question. So I would say that the products that we're selling today are highly value and Pioneer's been very supportive of Enlist E3. So this isn't about all of a sudden Pioneer's going to be in the game with Enlist 3, our overall reach in the soy market with our brands is somewhere in the \u2013 call it in the mid-30s would be what our brand share is. And the majority of that would be in the Pioneer side. So clearly, we've got a strong reach in the marketplace with our owned seed brands and we've got over 100 licensees that are in the marketplace selling Enlist E3. So it's a material move and as we ramp up our proprietary genetics, it's going to have a strong impact, not just in terms of I think the performance of our products and the experience that our customers receive but it's also going to have a very positive impact on our financial performance as well. And the underlying financial health of our soybean seed business specifically and also our overall seed business. So a strong move forward as we move into 2023. Chuck Magro : Okay. And that concludes today's call. We thank you for joining and for your interest in Corteva. We hope you have a safe and wonderful day. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Kim Booth, please go ahead. Kim Booth : Good morning, and welcome to Corteva\u2019s Second Quarter and First Half 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Chuck Magro, Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Anderson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Tim Glenn, Executive Vice President, Seed Business Unit; and Robert King, Executive Vice President, Crop Protection Business Unit, will join the Q&A session. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks during this call, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of the Corteva website and through the link to our webcast. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are our expectations about the future. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could materially differ from these statements due to these risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those discussed on this call and in the Risk Factors section of our reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please note in today\u2019s presentation, we\u2019ll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release and related schedules along with our supplemental financial summary slide deck available on our Investor Relations website. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Magro : Thanks, Kim. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. There are several key topics we\u2019re excited to share with you today, including our strong results for the first half. Robust customer demand and sustained execution amidst dynamic market conditions resulted in double-digit growth in sales and operating EBITDA. Strong organic sales gains in every region are a testament to continued customer demand for our differentiated sustainably advantaged technologies. On the Seed side, our top-tier genetics continue to be in high demand as growers prioritize yields to help offset inflation. In Crop Protection, new product sales surpassed $1 billion for the first half, an increase of more than 60% compared to prior year. This was led by products like Enlist herbicides, which has more than doubled in sales compared to the same period last year. The Enlist system continues to gain traction in the market given its superior performance and grower confidence. And we now estimate Enlist soybeans were planted on at least 45% of U.S. soybean acres in 2022. This is a remarkable feat considering this technology has only been in the market for three seasons. Market challenges persist, including tightness in supply chains and continued inflationary costs. Despite this, the organization is executing well, utilizing price and productivity actions as well as tight controllable cost management to offset inflation. Through the half, these actions, along with a mix of new technology products, helped to drive margin expansion of almost 130 basis points. Looking forward, we are also taking new strategic and operational actions to further accelerate our performance and create shareholder value. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 5, where I\u2019ll provide an update on the progress we\u2019ve made on our strategic framework. Earlier in the year, we announced that we moved from a matrix organization to a global business unit model to drive overall simplicity and speed of business while increasing accountability. Today, we are announcing actions associated with a comprehensive strategic portfolio review we recently completed. At the center of our strategic review, we focused on several key priorities, including developing and commercializing differentiated technologies, shaping a performance-driven organization and maximizing customer experience. As a result of these reviews, we plan to exit nonstrategic geographies and product lines while redirecting resources closer to the customer in core markets. Importantly, we are employing a strategy of differentiation to drive our competitive advantages, bringing unique, sustainable ag technology solutions to growers to drive advancements in global food security, climate change and the energy transition to include biofuels. I\u2019ve said from day one at Corteva, our technology engine is a powerful differentiator in terms of value we create for growers, society and shareholders. We plan to provide a deep dive of our pipeline as part of our upcoming Investor Day. But here are a few highlights to give you more confidence today. On the Seed side, we have nearly 20 times the experimental hybrids in our corn pipeline compared to 10 years ago, a testament to the strength of our data science capabilities. On the Crop Protection side, as I look forward to 2024, we will have launched 10 new active ingredients, 90% of these new products meet our sustainable innovation criteria. Utilizing this strategy, we will prioritize investments to support innovation while also balancing our commitment to return cash to shareholders. In fact, since 2019, we have returned more than $3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Now let\u2019s turn to the outlook on Slide 6. Recent ag commodity price volatility has increased due to several factors, including the war in Ukraine, increased energy costs, especially in Europe, the strengthening U.S. dollar and continued cost inflation pressures. Although we expect to see expansion of planted acres in Latin America, global grain supplies remain tight, especially as dry weather casts uncertainty over important growing regions. Despite the short-term volatility, the outlook for agriculture remains positive. We expect record demand for grains and oilseeds in 2022, which we believe will support commodity prices for the next few years as demand continues to outpace supply, and we work to rebuild ending stocks. Farmer income levels remain at near record highs despite increased input costs for fuel and fertilizer. We are encouraged by resilient demand as growers prioritize the latest technology and top-tier products to increase productivity on the farm. Based on this market outlook and in conjunction with our refocused strategy and second half operating plans, we are raising our previously provided guidance for the full year. Net sales are now expected to grow 11% and operating EBITDA 17% at the midpoint over prior year. This level of operating leverage demonstrates we are on the right track, and I look forward to sharing more of our plans with you soon. With that, let me turn it over to Dave to provide financial details on the half and the outlook. Dave Anderson : Thanks, Chuck, and welcome, everyone, to the call. Let\u2019s start on Slide 7, which provides the financial results for the quarter and the half. As Chuck said and as you can see from the numbers, we\u2019ve started the year strong. Quickly touching on the quarter, organic sales increased 13% compared to 2021, with gains in both segments and all regions. This translated into earnings growth of 18% and margin improvement of more than 150 basis points, another solid quarter of continued growth and margin expansion, and I think differentiating Corteva in this environment. Now focusing on the half, organic sales grew 14% over prior year, with broad-based price and volume gains. Global pricing was up 9% with notable increases in both, Seed and Crop Protection. Volume growth in Crop Protection of 16% was driven by strength of new products, which delivered approximately $400 million of sales growth year-over-year, an increase of more than 60%. We delivered $2.8 billion in operating EBITDA in the half, a 17% increase from the same period last year. This is noteworthy given the continued inflation of raw and energy costs, commodity price volatility and the war in Ukraine. Pricing and productivity more than offset the higher costs incurred as well as an approximate $200 million currency headwind, driven predominantly by European currencies. This improvement translated into almost 130 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year. Let\u2019s go to Slide 8, where you can see the broad-based growth with strong organic sales gains in every region. In North America, organic sales were up 9%, driven by Crop Protection on demand for new technology including Enlist herbicide. Seed volumes were down versus prior year, primarily due to a reduction in U.S. corn acres and supply constraints in canola. Soybean volumes were up 4% versus prior year, driven by continued penetration of Enlist. Both segments delivered pricing gains with corn and soy up 6% and 7%, respectively, and double-digit pricing gains in Crop Protection, more than offsetting higher input costs. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, organic sales increased 19% compared to prior year, driven by both, price and volume gains, again in both segments. It\u2019s an impressive performance by the organization considering the impact from the war in Ukraine and the recent dry weather condition in parts of Western Europe. Seed pricing increased 12% and helped to mitigate currency impacts. And for Crop Protection, demand remains high for new and differentiated products, driving volume growth of 15% year-over-year. In Latin America, we delivered 31% organic growth with double-digit volume and price gains. Pricing increased 13% compared to prior year, driven by our price for value strategy, coupled with increases to offset rising input costs. Seed volumes were flat due to tight supply of corn, while Crop Protection volumes increased 34%. We also had a timing benefit on an early customer demand in Brazil, shifting some forecasted volume into the second quarter. Asia Pacific organic sales were up 13% over prior year on both volume and price gains. Seed organic sales increased 24% on strong price execution and the recovery of corn planted area from last year\u2019s COVID-related impacts. Crop Protection volume growth of 5% was again led by demand for new and differentiated products. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 9 for a summary of our operating EBITDA performance. First half operating EBITDA increased nearly $400 million to $2.8 billion. And as I covered on the prior slide, strong customer demand drove broad-based organic growth with price and volume gains in all regions. On costs, we incurred more than $500 million of market-driven cost headwinds in the half, driven by higher Seed commodity costs Crop Protection raw material costs as well as freight and logistics. The company achieved approximately $130 million in productivity savings in the half, which helped to partially offset this impact. Currency was a $200 million headwind, primarily by European currencies. The organization\u2019s focus on meeting increased customer demand, while effectively managing cost headwinds through pricing, product mix and productivity resulted in nearly 130 basis points of margin improvement for the half. Let\u2019s turn now to Slide 10. I\u2019d like to expand just a little bit on our cost actions. In connection with the business realignment that Chuck referenced, we\u2019ve completed a strategic assessment of our priorities and operational structure. As a result of this assessment, we anticipate incurring restructuring charges on a quarterly basis through the second quarter of 2023 of approximately $400 million. Roughly half of the $400 million of restructuring will result in cash payments and the remaining $200 million is related to long-lived assets, the Russia withdrawal, and some inventory write-off. This quarter, we recognized $68 million in restructuring and other charges. These charges were primarily a result of contract terminations, a reduction in headcount and a $45 million charge related to our previously announced withdrawal from Russia. We expect additional restructuring and other charges of approximately $325 million over the next 12 months, including charges from headcount reduction and rightsizing our operations and functional support structure. And finally, and a key point, we expect the restructuring actions will deliver more than $200 million in run rate savings by 2025. More to come on this, but we believe these actions will position us to deliver increased value in both, the short and long term. Let\u2019s go now to Slide 11 and talk about the remainder of the year and our updated expectations for 2022. With the backdrop of our strong first half performance, we\u2019re raising our reported net sales guidance to be in the range of $17.2 billion to $17.5 billion for the year, representing 11% growth at the midpoint and includes an approximately 2% to 3% currency headwind. We are also raising our operating EBITDA guidance to a range of $2.95 billion to $3.1 billion or 17% growth over prior year at the midpoint. This increase reflects continued strong price execution in both segments and all regions, both for our technology in response to rising input costs. We now anticipate $500 million of year-over-year improvement in sales from our new Crop Protection products, an increase of $200 million over our original annual assumption driven by strong demand in every region. And as we focus on the second half of the year, we expect pricing and productivity to more than offset cost headwinds, which are driven by Crop Protection raw material costs, Seed commodity costs as well as freight and logistics. Volume growth will be led by Crop Protection, primarily in Latin America as farmers look to the newest technology to drive productivity on the farm. Seed volumes are expected to be relatively flat in the back half of the year with tight seed supply in Latin America corn. And regarding the third and fourth quarter outlooks, we expect the distribution of both revenue and operating EBITDA between the quarters to be consistent with our historic patterns. The volatility of exchange rates continues to be a key variable that we\u2019re monitoring, primarily the Brazilian real. While we are largely hedged for this currency exposure, we currently expect an approximately $50 million headwind in the second half. We continue to maintain disciplined spending we anticipate that SG&A as a percent of sales will improve by more than 100 basis points for the full year. Increased customer demand, coupled with the ability to manage cost headwinds through pricing and productivity is expected to result in approximately 100 basis points of margin improvement for the full year at the midpoint. We\u2019re raising our operating EPS guidance to a range of $2.45 to $2.60 per share. A lower share count driven by the $600 million of share repurchases completed in the first half of this year, coupled with strong operating earnings is driving an expected 17% increase in operating EPS year-over-year. Lastly, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.3 billion, lower than our earlier assumption of $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion. The change is led largely by higher accounts receivable balances on higher revenue. Despite the increase in working capital balances, all working capital metrics including days sales outstanding receivables and our inventory day supply continue to be strong. Let\u2019s now go to Slide 12, just to summarize a few key takeaways. It\u2019s clear that our organization, as Chuck has said, is executing very well. We\u2019re obviously very pleased with the strength of the first half results. This momentum gives us confidence to raise our full year revenue and earnings guidance. And we\u2019ve taken very important steps in our strategic road map to accelerate operational performance, and drive continued operating EBITDA margin expansion. We\u2019ve completed comprehensive portfolio reviews. We\u2019re taking cost actions to support our strategic priorities and our performance outlook. And finally, we plan to maintain our track record on capital deployment with our recently announced 7% increase in the dividend, and we expect to complete approximately $1 billion in share repurchases for the year. So, we\u2019re excited to share more about this at our upcoming investor event. And with that, Kim, I\u2019ll turn it over to you. Kim Booth : Thank you, Dave. On Slide 13, I want to briefly share the agenda of our upcoming Investor Day. As a reminder, the event will be held on September 13th in Johnston, Iowa at our global business and R&D center. The management team will provide more detail on the strategic update that we touched on today as well as how these actions will translate into earnings and margin growth, will detail our financial framework and include a showcase of our innovation pipeline. Registration details are available on our website, and we look forward to seeing many of you in person at the event. Now, let\u2019s move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both, our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instruction. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Just a question on the 5% of sales that you\u2019re going to exit as well as the $200 million program. How would you characterize both of those in terms of is this just complete finality and you\u2019ve gone through everything top to bottom, and that\u2019s it, it\u2019s only 5% of sales and the $200 million, that\u2019s all you\u2019ve -- that\u2019s it, you figured it out, or is it the case that maybe there\u2019s some more sales that are sort of on the bubble that you\u2019re going to reevaluate down the road and that you think maybe as you get through the $200 million, you may find other things to do? How would you characterize these programs? Chuck Magro : Good morning, Vincent. So, why don\u2019t we do this, this morning? We\u2019ll have Dave talk a little bit about the process that we went through. I will say it was an expensive process. We had many employees involved in the effort. And then, I\u2019ll come back and I\u2019ll give you a perspective on what we think where we are in the overall outcome and what we\u2019ll share more for you in September. So, let\u2019s start with the process this morning. Go ahead, Dave. Dave Anderson : Sure. Yes. Let me just say that -- echo what Chuck said, which was -- this was very comprehensive and involved the breadth of the organization to really ensure that we are looking at all elements of the portfolio as well as again, as our cost structure, Vincent, I\u2019m going to call it fit for purpose in terms of that cost structure. In terms of the process, you really think of -- I think of it as two dimensions. One dimension is our, call it, unique and technology-based, differentiated products. In other words, do we have, call it, comparative and competitive advantage in particular products, in particular geographies, so call it, markets. And the second one is, of course, then we apply to that screen in terms of our financial performance. Are we delivering, if you will, economic profit in those markets? It was really that screening process that allowed us to really stand back and really scrub, which are those that are really strategically significant and core to the business going forward. And what was the appropriate resource allocation associated with that, including the appropriate go-to-market strategies? All of that then resulted in what you just referenced, which is a decision -- which by the way, is still in process. And Chuck will talk about that from a timing standpoint. But, decisions in terms of some of these, call it, market exits as well as some of the realignment of the cost structure. Just on the cost structure, and that may be what you\u2019re reference being in the $200 million to $400 million of restructuring, $200 million of that is, call it, cash costs, which will generate $200 million of savings in terms of run rate savings by 2025. There\u2019s more that we\u2019re doing. There\u2019s more simplification, more additional other work. It will also provide benefit. And again, we\u2019ll expand on that as we come together again in September. Chuck, do you want to add to that? Chuck Magro : Yes. So look, I think from a process perspective, we spent a lot of time and effort. We\u2019ve made the decision to exit what we call some nonstrategic geographies and product lines. Where we\u2019re still focused, Vincent, to be candid with you, is there\u2019s some markets that we\u2019re still analyzing when it comes to what level of resourcing should we have, what\u2019s the route to market. So, these are some of the other pieces of work that are still on the to-do list. But the way you\u2019ve referenced it is accurate. We, I think, did a very good analysis on the ability for the markets to grow the strategic fit that we\u2019re trying to shape up for our focus and then how much money we make in some of these markets and different product lines. And we\u2019ve made the decision, as you\u2019ve referenced. So, there\u2019s about 5% of our revenue that\u2019s impacted here. But we\u2019re going to keep essentially all of our EBITDA. But there\u2019s some further work to be done. The reason we\u2019re not talking about specifics today, just to be candidate, we still have to go through the internal communication process. We haven\u2019t notified some of our other stakeholders around the specifics. And so, those plans are going to take some time. But I think that when you think about the $200 million that\u2019s related to the $400 million write-down, what I would say to you today is that is one element of a broader strategic and financial framework, which we will share in our September Investor Day. So, I think the way you asked the question is this it? Is it done? I think you need to wait till September to see the overall financial framework that we\u2019re going to lay out at the Investor Day, so that you\u2019ll be able to measure to monitor our progress for value creation. We think that we\u2019ve got a great plan now put together. Obviously, it\u2019s going to be key to execute the plan. But we\u2019ve, I think, looked at the company from, first of all, a strategic lens and then an R&D and innovation lens and now a financial lens. And when we put that together, I think what you\u2019re going to see is a very comprehensive plan to drive shareholder value, but more than that, to really work on some of the world\u2019s biggest challenges when it comes to food security and the energy transition. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson : Maybe a two-parter on seeds. It looks like your soybean performance is really strong this year. The first part is, it looks like you\u2019re taking share in soybean seeds. Are you maybe giving up some share in corn seed? And then my second question is if you look into now a little early, but it looks like there\u2019s some really good trends happening in seed pricing and one of your competitors talking about double-digit -- low-double-digit price mix in corn and soybean seeds when we get into pricing season soon. Can you talk about that a little bit and where costs might trend for the next season versus now? Thanks. Tim Glenn : Hey. Good morning, Joel. This is Tim. I\u2019ll take a shot at these. So obviously, the first part on market share, I appreciate the comments on soy, especially and calling that out. The USDA reported in June what their expected acres were in the U.S. And I would say they were consistent with what we believe was planted. So, not a lot of conflict there. And again, they\u2019ll update that report next week. But based off of where we sit today is we believe we gained market share in North America, both on corn and soy. So, on corn, both Pioneer and Brevant contributed to that. And on soybean, Pioneer really drove the growth there. And on top of that, we did very well in Europe for both corn and sunflower. So, really strong execution in the field for us to be able to capture both share and value through really, really outstanding execution. So proud of where we sit there and really positive momentum on both, corn and soy as we go here. In terms of pricing, as we go into next year, clearly, that\u2019s going to be one of the big questions that\u2019s always out there. I guess, I\u2019d start with really reinforcing the strong execution we had in the first half of 2022. We went out with a, I think, I\u2019d say, a bold approach to pricing this past year, and we were able to deliver 7% globally and really 7% for each of our major craft categories in the first half, corn, soybeans and our oilseed products. So, it\u2019s -- to me, it\u2019s a testament to the value that we\u2019re delivering to farmers and also continuing with that strong execution in the field. As we turn the page to 23, we know it\u2019s going to be a competitive market. But the general economics continue to remain favorable and our customers are demanding products, technology, that are going to help them drive yield and profitability. So, we\u2019re in the process now of working on our offer for 2023. And from a North America time line, we\u2019ll start to roll that out here in August and that will continue, August and September, will be out in the marketplace. In Europe, it will be more like a September, October time frame. We\u2019ve got a strong portfolio of hybrids and varieties. Farmers are recognizing the value. Our teams have a proven track record of executing in the field and capturing value, and we continue to expect our pricing to be accretive to margins in 2023. So, in Seed, it\u2019s a huge amount of priority. Generally speaking, we don\u2019t have the area increase that much in any one year. So for us to be able to continue to drive growth, value and margin expansion, we\u2019ve got to be able to continue to execute strong in the price area. Chuck Magro : Yes. Joel, maybe just a good call out on Enlist. So, we mentioned in the prepared remarks that we\u2019re now anticipating that we\u2019re on 45% of the U.S. soybean acres. I\u2019ve traveled through the South and the Midwest over the last two weeks talking to our customers. And I\u2019ll tell you, there\u2019s a lot of excitement around this technology. Just from multiple dimensions, I think it is a set of tools that farmers need. We\u2019re just very pleased at how the farmers are adapting to the technology. I actually attended a couple of training sessions for some of our retail channel partners two weeks ago. And look, everything looks great when it comes to the Enlist system. And in the first half, we crossed the $1 billion range for the entire technology platform system. So, you start thinking about that. Now, it\u2019s another $1 billion franchise that Corteva has, and I think that there\u2019s some good things to come down the road. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve only been on the acres for three seasons now. So, there\u2019s still some more to come. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Chuck, just on Crop Protection, again, very good results here. Are you still seeing cost increases here? Are you still raising prices? And how durable are these price increases, going forward? Chuck Magro : Yes. Thanks, David. I\u2019ll have Robert address those questions. Robert King : David, when you look at Crop Protection for the year, yes, we\u2019ve seen some inflation in the first part of the year and been able to use our value for pricing strategy as we move forward there of more than offsetting with price and productivity. So, we\u2019ve been able to hit those headwinds off. As you look into the second part of the year, we\u2019ll continue to follow that same strategy, and we do expect to continue to have some headwinds, although we think that the inflation will begin to slow a little bit based on being able to lap the previous year increases, but we do anticipate there will continue to be headwinds. And so, we\u2019re going to continue to follow the same strategy, watch inflation closely. But we think we\u2019re in a very good position with the technology that\u2019s being pulled onto the farm from our growers. If you look at our new products, right, we\u2019re up 60%. And I think that\u2019s a big I guess, shot in the arm for us from a standpoint of the demand for our new technology that is being pulled into the market. So I think that\u2019s sort of how you should look at the second half. Dave Anderson : Yes. And Dave, maybe -- this is Dave Anderson. Maybe I could just add a little bit to Robert\u2019s comments. As we indicated, we have some incremental inflation we\u2019ve now built into our guide for the second half. So, it\u2019s bringing the total up now for the full year, probably into the 10% -- 10% to 11% range in terms of inflation as a company overall. And the components of that, Robert referenced, obviously, the active ingredients is a key component, freight and logistics, a very, very important component of that. So, we\u2019re really looking at all of this eyes wide open. Robert said, the early planning that we have is for the [Technical Difficulty] as we go forward. Again, we provide a little more insight to that forecast on that as we go forward to the year. I think one of the things that\u2019s really testimony to the company is the fact that we\u2019ve been out in front of this. When you go back actually to early 2021 in terms of what we began to see then and the actions that we\u2019ve been able to take subsequently. So, it\u2019s something that\u2019s very, very front and center for us. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Would you comment on your latest expectations for your net royalty payments in 2022 trending into 2023? And based on what you\u2019re seeing with Enlist and other trends, how would you describe your latest level of confidence in achieving neutrality there in the \u201828 or \u201829 time frame? Dave Anderson : Maybe I could just comment very quickly, Tim, on a couple of numbers. And then why don\u2019t you follow a little bit with that strategic view that Kevin asked about. But Kevin, you\u2019ll recall that basically, we\u2019re even with 2021 in terms of that net royalty assumption that\u2019s in the P&L that had to do with some benefits that we achieved in 2021 that were basically constant in 2022. There is a nice pickup that begins in 2023, and then we\u2019ll continue to ramp. Again, we\u2019re going to share more insights on that and more of a multiyear look of that when we get together in September. Tim, do you want to talk a little bit just about overall from your perspective? Tim Glenn : Yes, Dave. I think the big thing there as we look into 2023, there\u2019s one major driver. And as Dave said, we take a big step forward in terms of that move towards royalty neutrality as you say, Kevin. And that\u2019s driven by our significant ramp-up in the sale of Corteva genetics with the E3 trade in Corteva seed brands. And so, that\u2019s been something we\u2019ve talked about for, it seems like a long time now, about three years here and 2023 is when you\u2019re going to see the big move forward there. So, we\u2019re going to continue to increase the amount of Corteva branded sales that are Enlist E3, and we\u2019ll take a major step forward with that in the year and also a major ramp-up in terms of the proprietary germplasm that we\u2019ll have available for our brand. And down the road, what that does as we introduce our proprietary germplasm is opens the door for more licensing, not necessarily a \u201823 item, but further down the road, that\u2019s going to continue to offset those royalty payments that are ongoing and keep us on that path towards neutrality. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Parkinson with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Chris Parkinson : You hit on this a little bit earlier on the potential for CPC margins just given the degree of inflation and obviously, you\u2019ve been pricing quite well. There are also a lot of moving parts in terms of the new product momentum. I mean, it seems like Isoclast, Rinskor, all the things over the last few years are still carrying a decent degree momentum as well. Could you hit on that as it pertains to \u201823 and \u201824? And also just give us a quick update on the Spinosyns expansion. Chuck Magro : Go ahead, Robert. Robert King : Yes. Chris, when you -- thanks. When you look at second half and margin, Dave mentioned some of it a little bit ago, how we\u2019ll manage that. We\u2019ve had a great run in the first half of being able to manage our margin with the strong demand that we\u2019ve got for our new products, as you mentioned there. And so, like we said before, historically, first half margins are higher. The new product growth was disportionate to first half. But Latin America has also had an early season buying that happened a little bit in Q2 with just the strong demand that\u2019s going on there. But, all that said, we still expect to have a very solid second half for margins and we expect that our new products will continue to give us value there. The technology we\u2019re putting on the farm and driving value for the grower is something that is really being pulled by them, and it\u2019s something that\u2019s given them a new tool in their toolbox. Specifically to Spinosyns, so our capital projects that has been running there up in Midland, Michigan is on track. We\u2019ve actually had our first commercial product to come off the off the line, and we\u2019re working on moving forward there. So, this is going to be a good expansion for us over the next few years on a product that is in high demand in our markets. And as we ramp up between now and 2050, that\u2019s going to put another 50% capacity into the market that will be good value add for us and to the growers. Chuck Magro : Yes. Chris, the way I think about CP and the journey we\u2019re on for the next couple of years, it\u2019s sort of more of the same. I think just if you look at the first half results, it\u2019s clear we have the right strategy and the CP team is executing very well. And I would consider to be quite challenging market backdrop when it comes to supply chain challenges and cost inflation. So I think we do have the right formula. And where we\u2019re trying to take the CP business is to be a seller of differentiated and unique CP products. And so, the new products plus the Spinosyns capacity as it comes on line over the next couple of years, what you\u2019re going to see from us is that we\u2019re going to continue to sell the higher margin differentiated type solutions to farmers, and that should -- continually to improve our business. Now, when I look at the first half, it\u2019s a strong year by almost every measure when you look at our CP business. And some of that is the fundamentals and the timing from a customer demand perspective. Some of it is structural change that we\u2019re making in the product portfolio. And as you look out to \u201823 and \u201824 and I\u2019d even say \u201825, what I would expect you to see is just continued steady business improvement, margin expansion as we manage our controllable costs and we put new technology into the market. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: Your price cards for seeds typically come out in August or September, which is way in advance of the actual planting. And a lot can change between when the price cuts come out in the planting, especially in a year like this when there is so much volatility. So, how do you manage that volatility? How much of your seed production is hedged right now? And then, you also mentioned Brevant brand gaining share. Can you just give us an update on that in the retail channel? Thank you. Tim Glenn : Yes. P.J., let me take a shot at that. So in terms of volatility, I mean, there\u2019s always a fair amount of uncertainty at this time of the year in terms of our seed production. So, as we look out across the board, we\u2019ve been -- it\u2019s been a interesting environment. In the U.S., we saw commodity prices kind of peak in the spring and go down and now bouncing around a little bit. So, we\u2019re off of the high there. So, that\u2019s clearly one of the factors we deal with in terms of the other factor is clearly around our production volumes. We\u2019ve -- and this is both, a U.S. or North American and Europe issue in terms of the production season. We\u2019ve got a very distributed production footprint in terms of geographic footprint. So, we got some diversification there. We\u2019re largely irrigated in both North America and Europe. And I would say, as we evaluate far from certain in terms of what we\u2019ll harvest, we feel like we\u2019re close to budget right now in the U.S. despite some of the weather challenges that have been out there, and Europe feel very good, harvest is underway. And we probably have a little bit of higher stress from our production in Hungary, but other plants seem to have handled the stress well, and we really do expect to be in a good position there. So, in terms of timing, I mean, obviously, it\u2019s a balance. I\u2019d love to be able to price just in time and have every variable known. But from a competitive standpoint, it\u2019s very important that we get out in the marketplace and connect with our customers. And so, as customers are harvesting the commercial crop through the fall months, that\u2019s when they\u2019re evaluating their hybrids and what performed, what didn\u2019t perform, who they\u2019re going to commit to for the for the next year. So, it\u2019s very important that we\u2019re positioned well. We can go out there with a confident offer and put that in front of a customer at the time when they\u2019re ready to make their decision. And so that seed purchase decision timing has been very consistent over a number of years. And by the end of the year, farmers have generally made close to final decision in terms of the brands and the products, and they\u2019ll finalize the volumes as they get closer to planting and what the ultimate crop mix is. So, I don\u2019t anticipate that changing. And I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re dealing with a whole lot more variables. We are well hedged at this point, but we still have some hedge to go on both corn and beans. And so, we have not locked down our cogs right now. But we feel like we\u2019ve got a pretty good grasp on what that will be. And obviously, we\u2019re going to continue to use the levers, as Dave said, the controllables that are in front of us around productivity and pricing to help mitigate those situations. In terms of Brevant, we\u2019re rolling into year three with Brevant in the U.S. We continue to grow the business and which is really exciting in a year when acres were down in the U.S. and Brevant definitely did contribute to our share growth for corn in the U.S. this year. Our focus with Brevant right now is to continue to build confidence with our channel partners. And we got to continue to build confidence with our farmers. And so, we\u2019ve got excellent product performance. Things look good in the field right now. I spend a fair amount of my time connecting with those key channel partners. We continue to build the confidence and relationship and the interest. And as we roll into 2023, our third year in the market, I\u2019m very satisfied with the progress up to date and really excited about the opportunity and full expectation, we\u2019re going to continue to grow that segment of our seed business. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeffrey Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Can you talk about your pension liability and what it might look like at the end of the year? And how that might affect future pension fundings in the future. Second, could you talk about what your crop chemical growth in volume would have been if you didn\u2019t have new products? And then thirdly, is the restructuring that you plan really more in seeds than in crop chemicals? And if so, why, or is it even split? Dave Anderson : Okay. Jeff, why don\u2019t I start with the first one on pension? The pension status is another, I would call right now a good news story. Despite the -- some of the challenge in the equity markets, I think we\u2019ve managed this very smartly. We\u2019ve significantly reduced the percentage of asset allocation in our overall portfolio to return-seeking assets. And we\u2019ve also been able to obviously benefit from interest rate increases. At the end of 2021, the pension-funded status was over 92% -- over 90% funded. So, that was very healthy. And you recall those numbers from our filings and from our previous discussions. And despite equity markets and some of the other challenges, the reality is we\u2019ve been able to hold to an over 90% funded status through June 30th. In fact, I looked at the numbers just a couple of weeks ago, and we\u2019re still in that, if you will, positive territory. We\u2019ve recently recalculated all of the math looking forward. And as you know, it\u2019s fairly complex statistical analysis that goes into that, using our outside experts and actuaries. And there\u2019s little claim on the Company\u2019s free cash flow within the foreseeable multiyear outlook in terms of pension liability. So, I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s been very, very well managed. I think it\u2019s a really good news story when you think of Corteva. And what it translates to, obviously, is it gives us a fairly significant flexibility when we think about our capital deployment strategies and we think about the opportunity not only to return cash to shareholders and to invest, if you will, organically for growth. It also gives us opportunities selectively as we look at advancing our technologies and accelerating our market position in some of those key technologies. It really gives us a lot of flexibility going forward. Maybe on the last one on the restructuring, and then, Robert, you may want to talk a little bit about the CP volume without the new products. On the restructuring, there really isn\u2019t a precise split that I can give you between the two business units between seed and crop. When you look at it in terms of the major categories and components of what we\u2019re doing with the restructuring, it\u2019s really across the organization. And it\u2019s really, again, associated with an outcome of our portfolio reviews, our strategic review as well as looking at our overall cost structure and we think doing the right thing to set us up not only as you would suspect, for 2023 and as Chuck referenced, but really is taking a view over the, if you will, the midterm -- a multiyear midterm look at how to best position the Company going forward. Chuck Magro : Yes. And maybe before going to Robert, so Jeff, just on the restructuring. So, Dave covered that well. What I would say is this was a company-wide exercise. It wasn\u2019t simply a product line or a BU exercise. So, we started with the top of the house, the strategic direction. So yes, there\u2019s going to be AIs that we\u2019re exiting. There\u2019s going to be more focus on certain crops, but there\u2019s also a really good look at our infrastructure and what cost structure do we need to go forward. We\u2019ve even looked at our digital offering. So, this was very comprehensive. It wasn\u2019t contained to one or two of the BUs, and we\u2019ll put all of that together for a financial and operational framework for you to understand at our Investor Day. So maybe, Robert, can you address the CP growth volume question? Robert King : Yes. Sure, Chuck. Jeff, when you look at this, the new products grew $400 million for the half. But more importantly, your question of what would it be without it? A lot of things in that. Old products would still be sold in those plates oven, et cetera, but it\u2019s not just straight math. There\u2019s a lot of different moving parts to this. I think the big thing to understand here is the grower demand is very strong. And so, there would be -- there\u2019s a continued need for products on the farm. And the new products are filling a need there with the technology, et cetera, that we give them as a new tool. Dave Anderson : And I think just maybe, Robert, just to add quickly to this and something you mentioned earlier is obviously, we\u2019re benefiting in terms of what you\u2019re able to bring to the bottom line and what you\u2019re demonstrating in terms of margin expansion that those new products are also contributing, too. So very important, not only meeting demand in the marketplace, but also adding value, which is great. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. Curious as to what you heard on your travels in recent weeks, Chuck on the level of dicamba drift that has occurred this year. What are your data sources indicating to you in terms of is it worse or perhaps maybe less so than prior years just because of the shift towards Enlist. But more importantly, if you have a view on whether EPA might take some action on the dicamba registration like they\u2019ve suggested where that could make over-the-top use of dicamba more challenging in \u201823. If that were to happen, how would your lineup of seed production in 2022 give you the opportunity to really shift more towards Enlist in 2023? And just one more on there. You mentioned renewable fuels. I\u2019m curious if any of that soybean pipeline you have includes any high oil percent soybeans in the lineup to be feedstock for R&D down the road? Chuck Magro : Yes. Good question, Steve. Thanks. I\u2019ll comment from my travels and then Tim spends most of his days out there. So, let me just address the renewable fuels question for you right up front. So yes, I guess, the short answer is, we\u2019re going to show you some of our technology pipeline at our Investor Day. This is an area we\u2019re quite excited about to drive up higher oil, but also other elements of the genetic code, I think as well that Sam and his team are working actively on to do different things, even in alternative proteins. So, these are things that I think the world needs. There\u2019s solutions that are going to be -- we\u2019re working with some of our partners in different industries. There\u2019s a lot of excitement around what we can do. And so, the key for us will be not only solving the technology formula, but then the regulatory arena and the freedom to operate. And we need to put all of that together. But I think that from what I\u2019ve seen, certainly, is the science and technology is getting to a point where we can solve some of these -- at least make major steps to solve some of these really difficult challenges. Renewable fuels needs to be part of the energy transition. And I think that we\u2019re going to demonstrate some of that for you in September. Dicamba drift. So, I did -- as I mentioned, I spent some time in the South. And certainly, I\u2019ve seen the fields where there was dicamba drift and damaged the soybean fields, unintended consequences the way I would say it. So I won\u2019t comment on whether this should be furtherly taken up by the EPA. I think the EPA needs to figure that out. But, what we\u2019re trying to do, of course, is ensure that growers and even the retail channel have options and solutions. And when you look at the Enlist technology, of course, it doesn\u2019t have that same characteristics. When you spray the Enlist herbicide, it stays where it is intended to stay on its target. And that\u2019s one of the major reasons that\u2019s driving, I think, a strong demand from a customer base. So, that is one of the things that I think the market, in general, is highly focused on is keeping these products where they\u2019re intended to be applied. And I think the Enlist platform has demonstrated that it does that very well. Tim, observations? Tim Glenn : Yes. Chuck, I think your comments on the South very consistent. There\u2019s been a few pockets where I\u2019d say the visibility or the noise around some of those issues have been stronger this year and particularly in the -- when you get into the mid-South of the Delta area, and I\u2019ll be there next week and be spending time on the ground with customers and our sales team and channel partners and to understand more about it. In terms of speculating on what could happen from a regulatory standpoint, it\u2019s impossible to do that. And as Chuck said, the EPA is going to have to make a call on that. We have seen some states up and be more aggressive in terms of regulation. And I\u2019d say -- I\u2019ll speak in general, and last time, I spent a better part of the evening with about 30 of our field sellers in a meeting and got feedback on this. I\u2019d say across the Midwest, we\u2019ve kind of gotten to a critical mass with Enlist, where -- and some of those state regulations that are in place where maybe the issue is not quite as visible as it had been in the past years, at least in terms of what our customers are experiencing there. So, what we have to continue to do is support our customers through proper advocacy or our technologies, customers where they have concerns, farmers need to speak up to their channels within their states. And obviously, we\u2019re going to continue to support and advocate for best practices around safe use for all the technologies that are in the marketplace. I don\u2019t think we want to position this as Enlist versus Xtend or anything like that. We want to make sure that all technologies are available and that customers do have choice and that those products are used appropriately and those best management practices have to be in place. So, in terms of the 2022 seed crop, that\u2019s in the ground. And so, we will have a significant ramp-up in our branded business for 2023 sales. So, that\u2019s reflected in our RC production decisions already, Steve. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Michael Piken : Just wanted to get your sense in terms of the early buying from Latin America, how much revenue do you think might have been pulled forward? And if you could just give us a look at where you see the inventory situation in Latin America, North America and anywhere else interesting in terms of the Crop Protection inventories? Dave Anderson : Maybe I could just start there and just comment quickly on the numbers. And then, Robert, why don\u2019t you pick up and talk a little bit about those inventory levels in the overall market, as you see it in LatAm and Brazil? Estimate from -- kind of best estimate, this is a judgment is it\u2019s about $100 million or approaches $100 million benefit that we got in the second quarter. It\u2019s part of what -- when you look at our guide for the second half, we\u2019ve factored that in, in terms of our thinking and also contributes to what I said earlier. When you look at the distribution of both revenue and EBITDA between third and fourth quarter, how our outlook or our guide matches or is consistent with our historic pattern. So, that\u2019s one of the contributors in terms of that math. Robert -- and that\u2019s really just reflective. By the way, the $100 million estimate is really attributed, I think, to two things. Number one, just the strength of demand; and the second thing is that we had product available to fulfill that demand. So, Robert, do you want to talk a little bit about just the overall conditions? Robert King : Sure. Latin America, like Dave was talking about there, very strong demand [Technical Difficulty] and the growers there and unprecedented first half organic growth. I love to have it into the future, but that\u2019s really not realistically to be sustainable. But all that said, there is early season buying because when product is available, they\u2019re going to take it, the farmers are healthy financially and in a good position. But we expect to still have very good growth in the second half down there anyway. If we hit -- we should hit in that 25% to 30% organic growth, and that\u2019s nothing to laugh at either. So, we expect a very strong second half down there and the growers demand is really driving that. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to Kim Booth for any additional or closing remarks. Kim Booth : Thank you. And that concludes today\u2019s call. We thank you for joining and for your interest in Corteva. We hope you have a safe and wonderful day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Kim Booth : Good morning and welcome to Corteva's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Chuck Magro, Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Anderson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Tim Glenn, Executive Vice President, Seed Business Unit; and Robert King, Executive Vice President, Crop Protection Business Unit, will join the Q&A session. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks during this call, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of the Corteva website and through the link to our webcast. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are our expectations about the future. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could materially differ from these statements due to these risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed on this call and in the Risk Factors section of our reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please note in today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release and related schedules along with our supplemental financial summary slide deck available on our Investor Relations website. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Magro : Thanks, Kim. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. There are several key messages and updates we would like to share with you, along with our solid results for the first 9 months of the year, that demonstrate our strategic plan is really starting to come to life. Last quarter, you will recall we announced key actions associated with the completion of a comprehensive portfolio review. These actions include plans to exit nonstrategic geographies and product lines, emphasizing a strategy of differentiation to drive our competitive advantages, bringing unique, sustainable ag technology solutions to farmers to bring advancements in global food security, climate change and the energy transition. Today, we'd like to highlight a few proof points of our immediate execution of that strategy to accelerate performance and growth during the third quarter. First, let me reiterate that we are committed to disciplined and strategic portfolio management, prioritizing core markets, products and crops to simplify operations and to focus investment in differentiated and sustainably advantaged solutions. In terms of operational excellence, we are continuously evaluating our business to optimize manufacturing costs and streamline our supply chain. In that regard, we have decided to discontinue all U.S. commercial sunflower seed production servicing Europe by the end of 2022 crop production year. Given our previous announcement to exit Russia as well as various capacity expansions, we now have sufficient capacity to supply our European sunflower commercial seed needs from within the EMEA region. On the CP side, we announced last month that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Symborg, a leader in microbiological technologies. As we've said before, we will be utilizing M&A to supplement our organic growth by focusing on adjacencies and utilizing it to fill gaps in our portfolio. We are able to accelerate advancements in technology and our speed to market. Corteva first collaborated with Symborg to scale up and bring farmers Utrisha N and BlueN, both nutrient efficiency products, as part of a distribution agreement between the 2 companies. Respected throughout the biologicals industry, Symborg possesses a diversified existing portfolio, an emerging biocontrols pipeline and a very skilled workforce. Biologicals are expected to represent about 25% of the crop protection market by 2035. This transaction reaffirms our commitment to biologicals and building a more differentiated and sustainably advantaged portfolio that provides cost-effective solutions for farmers as well as our commitment to forming strategic partnerships to help accelerate innovation and growth. As it relates to our AI portfolio, we sold our Methomyl insecticide business outside of Brazil in August. We also made the global business decision to exit commodity glyphosate products, meaning glyphosate not mixed with other herbicides. Lastly, on an operational front, we've decided to cease production of certain intermediary products at the Pittsburgh, California manufacturing site by the end of 2025, allowing us to streamline and simplify our operations. These moves enable us to redeploy capital for investment in growth markets to provide innovative and sustainable solutions for farmers. We also remain very focused on bringing global farmers differentiated, next-generation solutions to help them be successful in this volatile and dynamic environment. In Seed, our top-tier genetics continue to be in high demand as growers prioritize yields to help offset inflation. In Crop Protection, new product sales improved by almost 50% compared to prior year. This was led by products like Enlist herbicide, which has more than doubled in sales compared to the same period last year. The Enlist system continues to gain traction in the market given its superior performance and grower confidence, delivering approximately $1.1 billion in net sales during the first 9 months of the year, an increase of nearly 80% versus the same period last year. We expect 2023 Enlist market penetration in the U.S. to be in the mid-50% range, representing approximately 70% of Corteva's lineup. As I've said before, this is a remarkable feat considering this technology has only been in the market for 3 seasons. Our refined strategy in putting the farmer first has been quite successful this year. we have delivered double-digit sales growth and over 190 basis points of margin improvement so far. As a result of this momentum, we have raised the midpoint of our operating EBITDA guidance and now expect between $3 billion and $3.1 billion for the full year outlook, which Dave will address in greater detail shortly. Now let's spend a few minutes on the ag market on Slide 5. Ag fundamentals remain robust with commodity prices above historical averages. We are encouraged by resilient demand as well as healthy farmer income levels and see broad opportunities in both business units as customers drive farm productivity. Farm income levels are expected to remain strong in 2023, following 2 record-setting years. We continue to believe that global grains and oilseeds markets need 2 consecutive normal crop years to stabilize global supplies. And 2022 is not a year to rebuild stocks. For the upcoming season, we're expecting U.S. planted area to be up slightly with a bias towards corn. Outside of the U.S., market growth looks strong in key markets like Brazil, where planted area is expected to increase low to mid-single digits. Strong demand, combined with tight supply and weather-related reductions in estimated yields, have continued to drive low stocks-to-use ratios for both corn and soybeans during the '22-'23 crop year. North American harvest is nearly complete for both corn and soybeans with USDA crop progress in the high 70s for corn and high 80s for soybeans. While yields have been strong in the northern and eastern Corn Belt, they have been below normal in the western Corn Belt and plains where it has been dry. Overall yield estimates by the USDA have been in the low 170s for corn and about 50 for soybeans, keeping crop prices elevated and farmer income strong in 2022 and into 2023. We'll continue to monitor the ongoing effects of inflation and strengthening U.S. dollar while remaining focused on what we can control. With disciplined execution on our refined strategy, we expect price, mix and productivity actions to continue to outpace inflationary cost pressures. Given healthy market fundamentals, we believe farmers will continue to have strong margins and liquidity. They will prioritize investments in top-tier genetics and crop protection technology to maximize and protect yields. And with that, let me turn it over to Dave to provide details on our financial performance as well as updates on the outlook. Dave Anderson : Thanks, Chuck, and welcome, everyone, to the call. Let's start on Slide 6, which provides the financial results for the quarter and year-to-date. You can see from the numbers, we had another quarter of strong performance. Quickly touching on the third quarter. Organic sales increased 22% compared to 2021 with double-digit growth in both segments and in all regions. This translated into earnings of $96 million for the quarter, growth of nearly 290% and margin improvement of more than 550 basis points. So another quarter of impressive growth and margin expansion. Now it's important to note that the third quarter includes some timing benefit from volume that was originally forecasted in the fourth quarter that shifted into the third quarter. This is incorporated in our updated full year guide, in the implied fourth quarter that we'll go through in a moment. This guide also includes third quarter performance favorability lives through for the full year. Turning to year-to-date. Organic sales grew 16% over prior year with broad-based price and volume gains. Global pricing was up 10% through the first 9 months with notable increases in both Seed and Crop Protection. Volume growth in Crop Protection of 13% was driven by the strength of new products, which delivered more than $470 million of sales growth year-over-year, an increase of almost 50%. We delivered approximately $2.85 billion in operating EBITDA in the first 9 months, a 23% increase from the same period last year. This is impressive given the continued cost inflation, commodity price and currency volatility and the war in Ukraine. Pricing, product mix and productivity more than offset the higher costs incurred as well as an approximate $270 million currency headwind driven predominantly by European currencies. This earnings improvement translated into more than 190 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year, reflecting the execution, including the portfolio decisions that Chuck referenced earlier. So with that, let's go to Slide 7, where you can see the broad-based growth with double-digit organic sales gains in every region through the first 9 months. In North America, organic sales were up 11% driven by Crop Protection on demand for new technology, including Enlist herbicide. Seed volumes were down versus prior year primarily due to a reduction in U.S. corn acres and supply constraints for canola in Canada. Soybean volumes were up 5% versus prior year driven by continued penetration of Enlist. Both segments delivered pricing gains with 6% pricing in Seed, 18% in Crop Protection, more than offsetting higher commodity and input costs. In addition, we're confident that we gained market share in both corn and soybeans in North America. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, we delivered 21% organic growth compared to prior year driven by price and volume gains in both segments. Seed pricing increased 12% and helped to mitigate currency impacts. In Crop Protection, demand remains high for new and differentiated products, driving volume growth of 18% through the first 9 months. In Latin America, Organic sales increased 24% with double-digit volume and price gains. Pricing increased 14% compared to prior year driven by our price-for-value strategy coupled with increases to offset rising input costs. Seed volumes increased a modest 1% due to tight supply of corn, while Crop Protection volumes increased 16% driven by demand for new products. Asia Pacific organic sales were up 12% over prior year on both volume and price gains. Seed organic sales increased 27% on strong price execution and the recovery of corn planted area. Crop Protection volume growth of 2% was again led by demand for new and differentiated products. Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a summary of our operating EBITDA performance. Through the first 3 quarters, operating EBITDA increased $540 million to $2.85 billion. And as I covered on the prior slide, strong customer demand drove broad-based organic growth with price and volume gains in all regions. Year-to-date, we've incurred approximately $830 million of market-driven headwinds and other costs driven by higher seed commodity costs, crop protection raw material costs and freight and logistics. We've delivered approximately $175 million in productivity savings, which helped to partially offset these cost headwinds. We continue to maintain disciplined spending with SG&A down as a percent of sales, more than 200 basis points from the same period last year. Currency was a $270 million headwind driven primarily by European currencies. Standing back, you can see the organization's ability to meet increased customer demand while effectively managing cost headwinds through pricing, product mix and productivity. And again, we believe this performance really differentiates Corteva. Turning now to Slide 9. I want to take -- make several points about the updated outlook for the full year. With the backdrop of our strong performance through the first 9 months, we're affirming our full year revenue guidance to be in the range of $17.2 billion to $17.5 billion or 11% growth at the midpoint, including approximately 3% headwind from currency. And as Chuck said, ag fundamentals remain strong as we finish out the year. However, we're monitoring supply availability as well as volatility in currency markets. We're raising the midpoint of our full year operating EBITDA guidance, now expected to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.1 billion or 18% growth at the midpoint. This updated guidance includes an estimated $50 million EBITDA favorability in the third quarter that is expected to carry through for the full year. For the full year, high single-digit pricing is expected to offset headwinds from higher input costs and currency. Lower spend driven by cost actions that we discussed and strong collections resulting in lower bad debt accrual also supports this outlook. The updated earnings guidance translates into approximately 110 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion for the year, again, impressive in this environment. Our full year EPS guidance remains unchanged at a range of $2.45 to $2.60 per share, as higher operating EBITDA is expected to be somewhat offset by higher exchange gain and loss impact. On free cash flow, we continue to perform well against our working capital metrics, including our days sales outstanding and inventory days supply. DSO continues to improve, reflecting the strength of farmer income as well as customer collections. Inventory days sales, or IDS, is trending higher this year given the significant increase in seed costs and the replenishment of crop protection inventory. We're now expecting higher working capital balances in absolute dollars for the year, but working capital to sales relationship is tracking to prior forecast. Our current thinking is that these higher working capital levels will result in free cash flow closer to the lower end of our previous guidance range or roughly $1 billion free cash flow for the full year 2022. So now let's transition to a discussion on Slide 10 on the setup for 2023. You can see our initial planning framework. It's intended to provide key assumptions as we begin to transition. We see 2023 as a continuation of the momentum from 2022 while also balancing the uncertainty of the economic environment. Specifically, given the appreciation of the U.S. dollar in 2022 and continued volatility in foreign exchange markets, we expect additional currency headwinds in 2023. Now we're going to continue to use financial hedging to mitigate the risk from certain currencies and use local pricing in key markets to offset the impact wherever possible. Nonetheless, we see another year of foreign currency translation headwind in 2023. While we expect cost inflation levels to begin to moderate over the course of '23, we will see cost headwinds in 2023 in both Seed and Crop Protection driven by commodity costs as well as raw materials. Drought conditions in Latin America earlier this year have put pressure on seed supply in the region. This will be a headwind to our corn volume growth in the first half of 2023, but we expect inventories to recover in the second half of the year. Our current estimate for U.S. planted area is to be slightly up for the 2023 season with a slight bias towards corn acres based on the current relative economics for farmers. This is clearly a positive for Corteva. In addition, in Latin America, we expect corn planted area to increase low to mid-single digits. On price-for-value strategy, that continues to be a key lever to offset inflation. Pricing for our yield advantage technology and differentiated solutions is expected to more than offset higher cost of goods sold. And as Chuck said earlier, we're making progress on our portfolio simplification, exiting commodity glyphosate products among other nonstrategic product lines and geographies will create a headwind to our base business volume growth. However, it will be accretive to margins, and the overall impact to operating EBITDA will be positive. We'll see an estimated $100 million reduction in net royalty expense next year driven by continued Enlist penetration and the increase of units in our proprietary genetics. Enlist E3 soybeans will represent approximately 70% of our U.S. soybean sales in 2023, and we expect about 65% of those will be in our own Corteva germplasm. This will support increased overall market penetration of the Enlist trait and will, of course, be a direct EBITDA lift. And finally, on our productivity and cost actions, the expected savings from our productivity work and restructuring programs will more than offset the increased investment in R&D for next year. So coupled with a strong market outlook and solid grower economics, we believe we're well positioned for another strong performance year. Let's now go to Slide 11 and just summarize some of the key takeaways. The company has taken very important steps in its strategic road map, including portfolio simplification and investing in growth. By exiting nonstrategic product lines, we can focus on key markets and provide differentiated solutions to farmers. And with the acquisition of Symborg, we've taken another important step building our biologicals business. It's clear that our organization is executing well. We're very pleased with the strength of our results through the first 3 quarters. The strong year-to-date performance gives us confidence to raise the midpoint of our full year operating EBITDA guidance. And let me just say a few words about capital deployment. As a reminder, we plan to repurchase $1 billion in shares in 2022 with $800 million completed through the third quarter. Since 2019, we've returned more than $3.3 billion of cash to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase, a clear commitment to deliver value to our shareholders. And finally, we believe that we've continued -- with this continued favorable momentum that will carry us into 2023 as we look to continue both performance and growth. So more to come as we make progress to advance our strategic framework and drive continued operating EBITDA margin expansion. We believe these strategies will further differentiate Corteva and deliver increased value for years to come. And with that, let me turn it back over to Kim. Kim Booth : Thank you, Dave. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A.  Operator, please provide the Q&A instruction. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Just wanted to see if you could give us any sense on inflation for next year in both crop chemicals and in seed, sort of any order of magnitude versus this year that we should start thinking about in the model? And maybe more specifically, in crop chemicals, could you talk about when you think raw material costs will peak and if there's the potential for any deflation at some point in 2023? Dave Anderson : So Vincent, this is Dave. Thanks for participating. So let me give you sort of a broad statement. And then, Robert, if you'd like to fill in a little bit more on the details on the crop side. And Tim, obviously, anything you want to add on the Seed side. But broadly, obviously, this year is shaping up to be much larger than anybody ever anticipated. Right now, if you look at our implied numbers, it's in -- around 10%, 10% to 11% on a full year basis in terms of overall cost inflation to include commodity costs as well as input or ingredient costs, freight and logistics. Just incredible. And again, just want to reinforce what we've been able to do this year in terms of execution, pricing, productivity, what Tim and Robert combined have been able to do to be able to deliver the performance. For 2023 and specifically to your question, we -- as we said in our prepared remarks, we anticipate that inflation is going to continue, that it's going to continue to be a headwind. We are anticipating moderation in the rate of inflation. It'd be too early right now for us to say precisely or even within a kind of a guidance range what that could be. We'll provide that together with, obviously, more details around 2023 when we provide our formal guide. But it will be a moderation of the rate but a continued headwind for us. That's what we're anticipating, and that's what we're planning in terms of our execution. Robert, you want to talk about crop? Robert King : Sure. Thanks, Dave. Yes, looking at the Crop Protection business, the cost inflation and supply disruptions continue to be fairly widespread. And as Dave said, at this point, we don't see a whole lot of improvement into 2023, although we're -- we've learned and we're in a better position to manage those into the future. That said, our track record of pricing our products based on the value that they add to the farmer plus the productivity, I would say, has been relentless with our teams is more than offsetting the cost increases and will continue to do so. We fully expect this momentum to carry us into 2023. As Dave said, 2022, we've seen inflation in the low teens. And -- but we do expect this to stabilize in the Crop Protection area as we begin to lap quarters. From the higher inflation rates we saw earlier, it will begin to stabilize a little bit. But I want you to take away that we're deploying every tool that we possibly can to manage cost and inflations. And our most effective tool is technology. And when you begin to look at -- our technology drives farm productivity, allowing the farmers to make more yield and offset the cost inputs that they have already coming out, such as gas fuel and fertilizer prices. We do see a continued strong demand for this latest technology, that will continue to help the farmers as we move into 2023, and we think we're in a good position to be able to handle it. Operator : We will now take our next question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Back in September, you gave a 3-year EBITDA growth target of 13%. Given the headwinds next year from FX and costs, would it be fair to think about that -- think about maybe sub-13% growth in '23, above that 13% in '24 and '25? Is that a decent way to think about the 3-year target? Dave Anderson : So David, maybe I could start. Chuck, you can add to this. It's a really good question. And just to -- for everybody's benefit, the numbers David's referencing back to our September 13 Investor Day where we said at the midpoint, '23 to '25, looking at about a 5% CAGR on the revenue side and around 13% on the EBITDA side. We see right now, as we look out to 2023, and I use that term a balanced framework, but it's a constructive setup, we think -- Robert, you highlighted for crop very well, all the actions that we're taking and what we're anticipating in terms of an overall market. We would think that 2023 would be, call it, ratable or in a pro rata basis should be an important and relevant contribution to that overall goal. So we see that as a good setup for the beginning of that 3-year period. Chuck, anything you want to add to that? Chuck Magro : Yes, David. Look, obviously, we're at the point where we're looking pretty deeply at 2023. And let me just give you sort of our current thinking. So first of all, we think 2023 is going to be a very similar year and set up for -- as 2022 was. And we think Corteva -- based on some of the early decisions we've made in 2022, we're feeling pretty good about 2023. I think the bottom line to take away is that we feel that we're on track to deliver that value-creation plan that we outlined in September. Now there's puts and takes, right? So the macroeconomic environment, we talked already about inflation today. We're watching that very carefully. Dave and Robert gave you our view there. The other headwind we clearly see coming at us is global currencies. And Dave can talk more about that. But the ag fundamentals are very constructive. We've got low inventories, below-trend yields, high crop pricing. This sets up the ag economy very, very well for 2023. We need rain. So we're not going to talk too much about the weather today. But North America, Latin America and even Europe, they all need rain. So assuming that we get some rain over the next several months, we're thinking that the ag economy is quite strong. And then for Corteva, just to take you back to September, the value-creation plan that we put in place within that backdrop of the market context, a lot of those levers are within our control. So we're going to see the first meaningful step of royalty neutrality in 2023, and we can talk more about that. We're going to see continued growth in our new CP products. They're adding a lot of value on the farm. We've got the new Spinosyns capacity coming online. And there's more portfolio moves that we will announce as we make those decisions, all within this context of this 3-year journey that we laid out. So we're feeling pretty good, even though there are some headwinds facing the organization in the industry, but we think we're pretty well positioned. Operator : We will now take our next question from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Joel Jackson : There's been some color in the markets about Enlist beans in a slightly different shade or color, maybe attracting, maybe a 5% discount the beans or some of the elevators as they look at grading [indiscernible] on grading. Can you comment on that, the extent of it, what you're doing for it, how much of the [indiscernible] the impact? Tim Glenn : This is Tim. I'll take a shot at this. So in terms of soybeans in general, farmers can and do see some variation in fields for any kind of soybeans. And the soybean-grading process allows for that color variation. The varieties respond differently to the environment. Certainly, there's a genetic component and other factors play in as well. In the case of Enlist E3 soybeans, color variation can show up as a light brown shadow on seed coat on the side of the hilum. And the variation is from natural compounds, and it's on the seed coat and does not impact nutritional composition or quality. We continue to answer questions and inquiries that come up, and we're very much connected to processors and end users as well as our channel partners and farmer customers. Demand for the technology remains strong, and farmers continue to get full value from the technology. And the grain is accepted in the marketplace. So there is no widespread discounting on Enlist soybeans. So I do want to reinforce that. And clearly, farmers continue to support the technology. The technology will continue to grow, and we're out there and quite active and visible in terms of answering questions or inquiries that may come up. Operator : We will now take our next question from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. P.J. Juvekar: I have a question on your decision to exit glyphosate. I would imagine that it's based on how volatile glyphosate is, and you're focused on more sustainable products. Maybe you can comment on that. Where you do have a underpenetrate in some of your products. Do you expect that the generics will kind of fit in the gap? And you mentioned $300 million of sales. Was there an EBITDA number associated with that? Chuck Magro : Yes. P.J., let me give you the overall strategic decision framework we used, and then Robert and Tim can talk the specifics around what's in and what's out in that decision and the impact to our Seed technology, which will be none, by the way, but we'll cover that in detail. So look, we just feel as an organization that we want to tilt our portfolio to solutions that are value-added and unique in the marketplace. And so these decisions are always difficult, but the decision for us is one of just providing very unique, differentiated technology to farmers that create long-term value. And that's really the simple part of it. The other point, though, is that we did run this through a financial lens. And the cold hard truth of our glyphosate commodity business is that we don't make a lot of money on it. So why allocate precious resources to this when we can put it to something else that have much higher margins and move the needle for farmers. So Tim, why don't you talk about sort of the thinking around Seed? Tim Glenn : Yes. I mean in terms of the Roundup Ready technology, I mean it is an integral part of our trade offerings today and will continue to be so. There's no -- certainly no intent to alter that. And it remains a technology that's highly valued by our customers, and they get great utility from it. And I think the other thing that plays into it is, as Chuck implied, farmers have a lot of choices on from where they source glyphosate. And there was really no, I'd say, direct linkage in terms of what we were supplying on the Crop Protection side and what we supplied on the Seed. They were very separate offers, and there was no incentive for -- really for a customer to purchase our glyphosate brand versus any other brand. And so from a Seed standpoint, it's steady as we go, and we'll continue to support the technology across multiple crops. Robert King : Yes. And then from the Crop Protection, just a little more specifics on the glyphosate exit. This really falls into what we shared at our Investor Day back in September, where we talked about one of the key pillars to our strategy is portfolio differentiation. And glyphosate is not one of those that fits that model. When you look at where we are today, this differentiated portfolio is going to continue to be led by improved market penetration by these new products. And that's going to be a key piece of us as we move forward. These sales can be around $2 billion this year. And we expect these to continue to grow in the high teens, low 20s this next year. Glyphosate is part of this exit plan of 20% of our AIs over time. And this is one of the first ones that you see moving out. The revenue number of that, around $300 million this next year, is what we'll lose to answer a specific question there. And from a margin standpoint, it's just part of that differentiation driving our margins better. We expect to have a favorable impact to the bottom line because of it. Operator : We will now take our next question from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho. Christopher Parkinson : You've mentioned a few things that could affect CPC margins heading into '23, and ultimately, '24 inclusive of exiting the business. Just a 2-part question. Just first, are -- is there anything else imminent that you're assessing within the CPC portfolio that would have comparable margins to the glyphosate business or potentially higher? And then what's your latest assessment/enthusiasm about some of your newer technologies that have already been launched but seem to be ramping pretty well, whether it's Inatreq, Isoclast, Rinskor, Zorvec, so on and so forth? Just if you could just give us some framework on how you're thinking about that heading into '23, it would be incredibly helpful. Dave Anderson : Maybe, Robert, I could just do a quick introduction on that for Chris, this benefit. I think number one to point out -- while it wasn't specific to your question, I think it's important to point out, and we referenced that earlier, is that we will have some volume headwind, obviously, in 2023 as a result of these decisions. The second thing I would mention, while obviously beneficial, as Robert said, to margin and to EBITDA, The second thing I would mention is that we did reference methamel as well as one of those items. It's down the list in terms of significance or size, but it is indicative of what we've done in terms of some of that portfolio refinement and actions. And Robert, do you want to talk about anything else and -- both on what we're doing refinement-wise, but also in terms of growth? Robert King : Yes. When you look at -- back to your question around the new products, we had shared earlier that we have about 8 new products out on the market since 2017 and 2 more to come over the next couple of years. This new technology, as I referenced earlier, is really being driven by the demand. It's helping the growers and -- attack challenges that they've not been able to in the past. And so we expect that to continue as we move forward. As Dave said, the glyphosate is one of the first ones the exit are announced. And the Methomyl ex-Brazil, outside of Brazil, was the other one that we've announced. We have others that will follow in 2023 that will have similar impacts, thus the headwinds that we think we will have on the revenue as we move forward on -- in 2023. But overall, this is -- again, this is part of our strategy as we move forward to shift our portfolio, to improve our margins and to get us to the goals that Chuck laid out for 2025. Operator : We will now take our next question from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Chuck, back at your Investor Day, you outlined tremendous growth potential that you see in biologicals and since then, you announced the Symborg deal. Can you just provide an update on the growth opportunities as you see them today for Corteva in terms of organic growth and how you think the pipeline of deals could evolve and support your growth in the years to come? Chuck Magro : Sure. Kevin. So look, if you step back and you think about the landscape from a Crop Protection perspective, you can just see that the world is looking for nature-based, biological-based products to have biocontrol, biostimulants, bionutritional products as part of the overall portfolio. As we said in September, we don't see this replacing traditional chemistry. So I want to be clear on that. But by the time we get to 2035, we do believe that the biologicals will be a significant part of the overall CP portfolio, and we're calling it about 25%. We've got a very robust internal R&D and innovation program around biologicals, and that work is proceeding very well. We're increasing our R&D investments in this area quite rapidly. But as we called out in today's call but also in September, we also feel that M&A will be an important part of this journey to build a world-class biologicals business inside of our CP portfolio. And the Symborg acquisition was one of the first ones that we've pulled the trigger on right now. We do have a portfolio of other opportunities that we're looking at. But if you look at Symborg, they're a leader -- a global leader in microbial products. We know the company. We know the products. We've had this distribution agreement I referred to with them. They have phenomenal skill set. And they're based in the right part of the world. They're based in Europe, where I think biologicals, the market's going to lead. The European market will lead a biological journey. So we -- there's a lot to like there. And I guess, to answer your question specifically, what's next, I guess stay tuned. We're going to use M&A to accelerate our R&D innovation and development and to get access to the market. That's how we're going to use M&A. Now let me just be clear, though, we do have a phenomenal internal program going on right now. We reviewed the portfolio just a few weeks ago. And there's lots of exciting things there, which we will share with you over time. Operator : We will now take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : In Seeds, it's relatively easy to have an idea of what pricing will be like for 2023. We look at your Seed cards in September and then extrapolate into next year. But how is it best to think about pricing in crop chemicals? Is that something that plays out each quarter? Are your prices set for next year? Is it easy to estimate? Do you have a view on pricing in crop chemicals in 2023? Robert King : Jeff, when you think about pricing in Crop Protection, yes, you're spot on. It is different from Seed. But it's something that we do plan for. It's not something that we're reacting to, but we plan for into the future. And when you look at what we've been able to do so far, it's really about the strategy around our differentiated products, plus the adoption that we're seeing by farmers supports this value proposition that we've seen. We don't see that changing as we move into 2023. Our track record of pricing for the products -- pricing for value is something that, coupled with our relentless productivity, it has been able to help us offset the rising inflationary costs from raw materials. We don't see raw materials slowing this next year or we see them stabilizing, but we see it will continue to increase. And so we'll have to continue to work on that as well. But as you look at the year, we're up 13% on pricing on a year-over-year basis, and we expect that momentum to carry us through into next year as well. Specific to your question around how do you think about it. There's 3 buckets that we think about when we begin to talk about pricing in Crop Protection. It's differentiated products. It's next best alternative products, and it's those that are close generic. The differentiated products is one that is really a core to our strategy, and that's where we're shifting the portfolio towards because this is a non-elastic, less price-sensitive because this is a true value-add to the grower. It actually helps improve the yield on a per-acre basis. The next best alternative is ones we began to think about. There are a few more substitutes available than the differentiated, so it's a little bit more elastic. But it's still far from the generics, which gets us back to that close generic. Those we're going to have to manage with the market and the commodity price nature there. But overall, our increase in differentiated products is one that over time will put us in a good position as it comes to how we extract value from the market. And as Chuck talked about in biologicals earlier, this also plays out into our overall shift of this portfolio to become more differentiated and to get ready for the future. So hope that helps. Operator : We will now take our next question from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Steve Byrne : So if I heard you right, Chuck, you're looking for the Enlist penetration in '23 on the soybean seed to be somewhere in the mid-50s with 70% of your own lineup. So that was -- the math on that would suggest there might be 30% of the Enlist seeds out there that are sold that are -- through some other seed companies. Can you comment on how much of that other 30% will generate a trait fee for Corteva? And could some of it generate a germplasm royalty to you as you start to roll out your own licensing of Pioneer genetics through GDM? Chuck Magro : Steve, let Tim walk you through sort of our thinking on Enlist market growth. Tim Glenn : Yes. Steve, good to hear from you this morning. Obviously, we're wrapping up another strong season with Enlist and very outstanding performance of both the herbicide program. And as we roll through harvest, varieties that we had in the marketplace are performing well and strong satisfaction with our customers this year despite really variable yield levels and some challenging environmental conditions. And as you say, 2023 is a very important year for us because it's when our proprietary genetics really kick in and will have an impact. And what I would tell you is, in terms of our licensing focus right now, we see that as a very important longer-term opportunity. In the near term, it's most important that we convert our own branded business to our proprietary varieties. And so we're in that process right now. As you say, it's going to be a major ramp up this year. So I wouldn't expect in the immediate future to jump on or think about licensing opportunities as first priority. But as we convert over our own branded business, which is substantial, we have a major share of the market both in the Pioneer brand and our other brands. It's going to open the door for us to, I think, really participate and have a strong position in that licensing opportunity. Robert King : Yes. Just to add to that, Steve, when you think about our platform in the CP side, we are still the only Enlist manufacturer for the herbicide that can go on the top of these beans as well. So that will give us some uplift there as well depending on how this plays out. Chuck Magro : Yes. And then, Steve, just the big picture is we're expecting in 2023 about $100 million of royalty reduction. So this is the first year where you're going to see meaningful value creation from the technology. And as -- obviously, as the market continues to be penetrated, we expect that number to grow to approximately $250 million by 2025. So really good value creation in the next 3 years on the Enlist technology platform. Operator : We will now take the next question from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : I want to come back to Slide 10. And certainly appreciate the color that you've already provided in terms of the '23 outlook. But I want to come to the 3 buckets of concerns for next year between the FX inflation and Latin American seed supply. As we sit here today, how would you rank order those concerns into next year? Dave Anderson : Maybe I could talk a little bit -- I'll talk a little bit about the currency point and just kind of give you just a little bit of a backdrop. And then, Tim, you want to talk about the other point. I mean, I think currency, as we indicated, is going to continue to be a headwind. Right now, if you look at where the major currencies are trading, and we think in terms of the euro, obviously, the Brazilian reais, the Canadian dollar, some of the other European currencies, as being significant for us, right? And when you look at those numbers, if you just did a sort of a flash of where we are today, we'd be looking at currency headwind that would be comparable to what we were experiencing in 2022. And we talked about a 3% headwind, that's revenue headwind. That would be a comparable headwind that we would anticipate for next year. On the inflation side, I think we talked about that earlier in terms of the macro consideration. And that one -- and Robert did a nice job of handling that as well. That one, we see that we're just going to have to remain very, very vigilant. We don't see -- other than obviously lapping very strong inflation this year and some mitigation of the rate of inflation, we don't see, call it, a piece dividend related to a reduction in cost -- major cost for next year. Tim, do you want to address some of the fundamentals? Tim Glenn : Yes. In terms of specifically in the Latin America seed supply, Frank, we're -- season is progressing well. And we've seen the timely planning of soybeans in central and north part of Brazil, and that's favorable for the upcoming safrinha season. And typically, the planning initiate in January. We've talked for a little while now about the tight seed supply, and it's based off of many factors. And it's really going to impact the first half of 2023. In terms of our ability to serve the market in the fourth quarter, we feel comfortable with that. But it's going to be a tight supply as we get into the, call it, the mid- to later part of the safrinha season, and we're working closely with our customers on that. So the production challenges, we're left with less inventory than we'd like. The focus for this season is certainly around capturing value more than volume in the marketplace, and I want to emphasize that. So team is extremely focused on capturing value there. We're going to rebuild our inventories as we move into Brazil. The bulk of our sales are certainly in the second half of 2023, and the focus is on getting back to a comfortable level of inventory by mid-year so we're going to be able to meet full demand in the second half of 2023. So I think on a full year basis, will be recovered and actually will be -- you're not going to feel an impact even though there might be some timing differences from what we would have seen in prior years. Operator : Will now take our next question from Josh Spector from UBS. Josh Spector : Just your Enlist penetration comments on 2023, I mean you have the targets for '25. Is '23 now ahead of your plan? And does that change what you think the ceiling could be in 2025? Could you be above 60%? Tim Glenn : Josh, it was just a couple of months ago that we had to signal what the new potential was, so we raised it. And obviously, we're in the discovery phase of what the opportunity is. So I can't say we have an update to what that is. Clearly, it's going to be depending upon a number of factors, some of which we control, some of which we don't control. But the important thing is that as we go into 2023, we expect Enlist E3 to be the majority or the top-selling technology in that very important soybean seed market. So that's a very significant milestone that we're reaching. And again, based off of performance of the technology and the system, Seed and Crop Protection, I think the market is going to determine that. But we're comfortable with that 60% today. And certainly, as we go forward, we believe we're going to have very strong genetics. We know we'll have very strong genetics from us and other providers in the marketplace. And there's no better crop protection system in the marketplace. So we feel comfortable about what our long-term perspective is -- or long-term opportunity is there. Operator : We will now take our next question from Ben Theurer from Barclays. Ben Theurer : Congrats on the results. Just wanted to stay along the lines around the royalties and some of the planning framework as you've mentioned that your expectation is that corn is going to lead the planted area in the U.S. next year. Are there any signs that you've seen that from like farmers' demand? Because obviously, that would be supportive to your royalty reduction if there's more demand for corn versus soy. So just to put a little bit into perspective, what if farmers' decision switching back to corn? And how much is really would you improve by accelerating Enlist and drive more of your own germplasm? Tim Glenn : Yes. Maybe I'll take a shot at this to start off with. And so as we look at 2023, obviously -- and from a North America perspective, it's early. But we expect that there's going to be that approximately 180 million acres of corn and soy that will be planted. That will be slightly up from a year ago as we certainly hope that we don't have a repeat of the prevent plant area that we saw this year, which was above what we would typically see. And when we talk about why the market's favoring or tilting towards corn, we're really basing it off of the market fundamentals. And the thing I always come back to is take the November '23 soybean price and divide that by the December '23 corn price, and that ratio is really indicative of where farmers' profitability is. And right now, that ratio is at about 2.15 to 2.2, moving around every day. But that is in a bullish range for corn. And it's actually probably the most favorable we've seen for corn in several years. So that's our signal right there. In terms of getting to the finer points of what are customers signaling, I'd say, hard to base it off of the book of orders we have right now. We're out there in the marketplace with customers and helping them make those decisions. We're talking about what their intentions are and booking seed for next season. But farmers are going to step back, and they're going to continue to monitor several things. I mean first is -- and Chuck talked about it earlier, the weather is going to be a factor. And we got a long way to go before customers plant a crop. And so I certainly don't see this as a barrier right now. But it is dry right now, and we need to get closer to normal precipitation through this winter so that we can be in better condition for all crops as we go forward. So farmers will continue to look at that. And certainly, farmers are going to follow the markets and what the relative profit opportunity is for each crop. And that is a very farmer-by-farmer decision that they have to make. And the types of shifts we're talking about, we're talking about a couple of percent shifting one way or another here. So it's subtle and it's hard to feel it en masse. You really have to look at it on an individual customer basis to see where that's going. But we're going to continue to be with our customers every step of the way from now until that crop goes in the ground. And as they make their hybrid and variety decisions, we'll be partnering with them. But that's kind of what the motivation is why we talk about the market tilting towards corn right now. Operator : We will now take our final question from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : I just wanted to get your thoughts maybe on growth of top line and EBITDA into next year. So on the top line, if we look at the slide with some of the positives and negatives, it looks like we can get to about a mid-single-digit level of revenue growth. And given maybe the $100 million of royalty reduction and some of the other drivers, that could be levered to maybe high single-digit EBITDA growth. Is that the right way to think about what you're preliminary thinking about '23? Chuck Magro : Well, let me give you my perspective and then, Dave, you can get into a bit more detail. So look, if you go back to the September Investor Day, we laid out a 3-year plan that had significant value creation, right, getting to 21% to 23% EBITDA margins, $4.1 billion to $4.7 billion of EBITDA from where we were at in the last -- in fiscal 2021 at $2.6 billion of EBITDA. We also said today that we are feeling very comfortable that we're on track for that value-creation plan and that Dave said, it's very ratable. So I think that, that's -- we'll give you our more specific numbers, obviously, in February when we give full year guidance. But today, given everything that we see coming at us, we feel very comfortable that we're on that plan. Dave, any other final comment? Dave Anderson : I think that summarizes it very well. Chuck Magro : Good. Thank you. Kim Booth : Okay. And that concludes today's call. We thank you for joining and for your interest in Corteva. We hope you have a safe and wonderful day. Thank you.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Kim Booth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. Kim Booth : Good morning and welcome to Corteva's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Chuck Magro, Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Anderson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Tim Glenn, Executive Vice President, Seed Business Unit; and Robert King, Executive Vice President, Crop Protection Business Unit, will join the Q&A session. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks during this call, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of the Corteva website and through the link to our webcast. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements which are our expectations about the future. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could materially differ from these statements due to these risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed on this call and in the Risk Factors section of our reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please note, in today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release and related schedules, along with our supplemental financial summary slide deck available on our Investor Relations website. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Magro : Thanks, Kim. Good morning and thanks for joining us today. I hope everyone's year is off to a great start. There are several key messages I'd like to share with you today including our strong 2022 performance, an overview of the market fundamentals and an update on our value creation plan, with a closer look at what's ahead for 2023. Corteva executed well amidst a dynamic market environment, delivering double-digit sales and operating EBITDA growth, as well as over 200 basis points in margin expansion. Enlist E3 soybeans reached about 45% market penetration in the US and new product sales in Crop Protection reached over $1.9 billion for the full year, an increase of more than 30% over prior year. On capital deployment, we returned more than $1.4 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases for the full year. Our 2022 results support the value creation plan presented at Investor Day, where we outlined a framework to achieve $4.4 billion of EBITDA by 2025, with a margin range of 21% to 23% and we're on track to do just that. The framework is simple and straightforward and hinges upon four key elements : portfolio simplification, royalty neutrality, product mix and operational improvements. The strategic and operational actions implemented since we announced the plan, show that we are already making progress on accelerating our performance and we were even able to achieve some of that value in 2022. We remain committed to our value creation plan and 2023 is going to be a year largely focused on execution. As a reminder, a critical part of our refined strategy involves increasing investment in R&D. We're focused on delivering greater value to farmers through more differentiated and sustainably advantaged solutions and leveraging our pipeline to drive advancements in global food security and climate change. On the M&A front, we announced our intent to acquire Symborg and Stoller, two biological acquisitions which are both set to close in the first half of 2023. These acquisitions reinforce our commitment to providing farmers with environmentally friendly sustainable tools with proven effectiveness that complement evolving farming practices and help them meet changing market expectations. As communicated previously, we expect that biologicals will be the fastest-growing segment in the Crop Protection industry over the next decade. Turning to the outlook. We entered 2023 well positioned with best-in-class technologies to continue to deliver market-leading value for our customers, as we tilt our portfolio towards our differentiated offerings. This is a big step change year for our Enlist platform. We're expecting E3 US soybean market penetration in the mid-50s and a royalty reduction benefit of over $100 million. Organic sales of new Crop Protection products including our Enlist herbicide are expected to grow by an additional 20%. And we're on track to cross $1 billion in annual sales with our Spinosyns franchise. More broadly, we expect that favorable pricing and mix in addition to productivity and restructuring benefits will continue to outpace headwinds associated with cost inflation. We will also continue to monitor the effects of currency, which we believe will be a headwind this year. As a result for 2023, we expect to deliver 5% sales growth in between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion in operating EBITDA translating into yet another year of impressive margin expansion. Now let's spend a few minutes on the market outlook on slide 5. Market fundamentals remain constructive, as we enter 2023. Global grain and oilseed stocks are tight, due to last year's below trend yields which were impacted by dry weather in the Northern Hemisphere and the war in Ukraine. Crop prices which remained well above historic averages are supported by tight supply-demand fundamentals globally. Farmers are financially healthy with strong liquidity and they will continue to prioritize yield to meet market demand and offset inflationary pressures. Farm income is expected to be one of the largest ever, albeit below the record achieved in 2022. And demand for corn and soybean oil, is expected to grow in 2023 supported by strong energy prices and policy adjustments focusing on low-carbon energy sources. Crop area is forecasted to be up in most major crop-producing regions in 2023. The USDA gave a January update indicating U.S. planted area is estimated to be 91 million acres for corn and 89 million acres for soybeans, both showing increases versus 2022. We continue to monitor the effects of weather around the globe including the drought conditions in Argentina. Brazil is projecting that national grain output, for the 2022-2023 crop season will be a new record, translating to low- to mid-single-digit growth. We expect these positive market conditions to continue throughout the year and could extend well past 2023 depending on supply-demand dynamics which is consistent with our previous messaging, that global grains and oilseed inventories need to be rebuilt over at least two years. And with that let me turn it over to Dave to provide details on our financial performance, as well as updates on the 2023 outlook. Dave Anderson : Thanks Chuck and welcome everyone to the call. Let's start on slide 6 which provides the financial results for the quarter and full year. You can see in the table, we finished 2022 with another quarter of strong performance. Quickly touching on the fourth quarter, organic sales were up 11% versus prior year, led by Latin America and North America. The strong organic sales translated into earnings of $370 million for the quarter more than 200 basis points of margin improvement. Turning to the full year, organic sales grew 15% versus 2021 with broad-based pricing and volume gains. Global pricing was up 10% over prior year with notable gains in both seed and crop protection. Seed volumes were flat due mostly to lower planted area in the U.S. Canola supply constraints and the impact of our Russia exit in EMEA. Crop Protection volume was up 9% for the year, driven by strong demand for new products. These new products delivered over $475 million of sales growth year-over-year an increase of more than 30%. We delivered $3.2 billion in operating EBITDA for the year an increase of 25% over the prior year. Pricing product mix and productivity more than offset higher input costs and currency headwinds. This earnings improvement translated into more than 200 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year reflecting the strength in execution by our organization. And as Chuck said, 2022 is an early installment on our multiyear performance goals that we shared with you at Investor Day. So let's now go to slide 7. You can see the broad-based growth with strong organic sales gains in every region for the full year 2022. In North America organic sales were up 10%, driven by crop protection on demand for new technology including Enlist herbicide. Seed volumes were down versus prior year, primarily due to a reduction in U.S. corn acres and supply constraints for canola in Canada. Soybean volumes were up 7% driven by penetration of Enlist. Both seed and Crop Protection delivered pricing gains with pricing up 6% and 14%, respectively. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, we delivered 18% organic growth compared to prior year, driven by price and volume gains in both segments. Seed pricing increased 11% and helped to mitigate currency impacts. In Crop Protection demand remains high for new and differentiated products driving volume growth of 15% for the year. In the fourth quarter volumes were muted by approximately $50 million related to the war in Ukraine in our previously announced exit from Russia. In Latin America, organic sales increased 23% with notable gains in both price and volume. Pricing increased 16% compared to prior year, driven by our price for value strategy coupled with increases to offset rising input costs. Seed volumes increased 4% with some pressure due to tight supply of corn, while Crop Protection volumes increased 10% driven by demand for new products. Asia Pacific organic sales were up 9% over prior year on both volume and price gains. Seed organic sales increased 23% on strong price execution and the recovery of corn-planted area. Crop Protection volume was down 1% due to wet weather and low pest pressure in certain areas, partially offset by demand for new products. So with that let's go to slide 8 for a summary of 2022 operating EBITDA performance. For the full year, operating EBITDA increased approximately $650 million to $3.2 billion. And as I covered on the prior slide, strong customer demand drove broad-based organic growth with price and volume gains in all regions and we particularly benefited from the strong finish to the year including favorable year-over-year performance in our functional spend. We incurred approximately $1.2 billion of market driven headwinds and other costs over the course of 2022 driven by higher seed commodity costs, Crop Protection raw material costs and freight and logistics. We delivered approximately $250 million in productivity savings, which helped to partially offset these headwinds. SG&A as a percent of sales was down more than 230 basis points versus prior year as we maintain disciplined spending and accelerated execution on certain cost actions. Currency was a $290 million headwind, driven primarily by the euro and other European currencies. Standing back to performance in 2022 is a result of strong execution by the organization, demonstrating our ability to meet increased customer demand while effectively managing costs through pricing, product mix and productivity. Turning now to slide 9. I want to provide an update on our full-year free cash flow performance. Free cash flow for the year was approximately $270 million, compared to over $2 billion in 2021. The year-over-year decrease is driven by higher working capital balances, primarily accounts receivable and inventory. Receivables increases were largely due to higher sales, reflecting both volume and pricing. Importantly, DSO metrics remain healthy, benefiting from the strength of farmer incomes and also customer collections. In the case of inventory, you'll recall we had significant drawdowns in 2020 and 2021 particularly in Crop Protection. This inventory drawdown was driven by significant customer demand in the face of supply chain challenges, product availability and shipping and logistics issues. This set of challenges was obviously not unique to Corteva and affected broader industry. In 2022, inventory increases reflect a rebuild of safety stocks to support growth, higher input and commodity costs, as well as the impact from market volatility. We have now been able to rebuild our inventory levels. We believe we have about the right balances at this time. Due to supply chain dynamics and their impact on working capital over the last few years, it's meaningful to look at the free cash flow to EBITDA conversion over the most recent two years rather than either year in isolation. Free cash flow conversion averaged 42% in a two-year period from 2021 to 2022. In 2022, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders including, $1 billion in share repurchases, a clear commitment to deliver value for our shareholders. Our pension liability continues to be well managed despite volatility in both equity and bond markets. As of year-end, the funded status of the US plan was 92%, and we do not anticipate cash contributions to the US plan in either 2023 or 2024. Now transition to a discussion on the guidance for 2023 on Slide 10. We expect net sales to be in the range of $18.1 billion and $18.4 billion, representing 5% growth at the midpoint driven by pricing and strong customer demand for differentiated best-in-class technology and increased US planted area. Keep in mind, that this growth is muted by approximately $600 million of product and geographic exits. 2023 operating EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion, a 9% improvement over prior year at the midpoint. Margins are also expected to improve with pricing, mix and productivity actions more than offsetting further cost inflation and currency headwinds, translating to roughly 70 basis points of improvement at the midpoint. Operating EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.70 and $2.90 per share, an increase of 5% at the midpoint, which reflects earnings growth, lower average share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and interest expense. We expect our 2023 tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%, an increase from the 2022 rate of 20.6% largely driven by US tax law changes impacting foreign tax credits and the treatment of R&D expenses. Higher interest expense is driven by higher borrowing costs and higher debt balances. As you know, we carry significant commercial paper balances throughout most of the year to fund cash needs. Our 2023 guidance assumptions include, a higher average interest rate on the commercial paper balances, as well as higher borrowing to finance growth including the Biologicals acquisitions. We expect that free cash flow will be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, with higher earnings partially offset by the higher cash taxes and higher interest expense. At the midpoint, this translates into a free cash flow to EBITDA conversion rate of roughly 34% or approximately 40% over the last three-year period. On Slide 11, I want to remind you of the value creation framework we laid out in September to accelerate our performance and deliver greater value to shareholders. The growth targets we presented included, a 2025 operating EBITDA of $4.4 billion or a 22% margin at the midpoint. This slide includes our 2025 performance targets from Investor Day, and it also reflects our actual 2022 performance in today's guidance for 2023. Execution on our strategic decisions including focusing on core crops and markets, pricing for value being disciplined in cost, is driving margin expansion while also enabling increased R&D investment. Again, our performance in 2022 was a major installment on the path to our 2025 financial targets. Coupled with our guidance for 2023, we're confident we're on track to deliver those targets. So let's now go to Slide 12, to discuss the operating EBITDA bridge for 2023. You can see the pricing in 2023 will be in the mid-single-digit range, which will more than offset the impact from higher commodity costs and raw material inflation. Increased planted area in the US and demand for our best-in-class technology including, continued penetration of Enlist E3 soybeans are expected to drive volume increases in North America. Latin America seed volumes are expected to be up for the full year, with the increase weighted to the second half due to supply constraints early in the year from last season's dry weather. Volume growth in North America and Latin America will be partially offset in EMEA, driven by lower expected corn-planted area and an approximate $200 million impact from our decision to exit Russia. Demand remains strong for differentiated technology, which will drive increased volume in Crop Protection. Sales of new crop protection products will add approximately $300 million of incremental organic revenue. We'll benefit from the ongoing Spinosyns capacity expansion as we expect the franchise to generate more than $1 billion in sales in 2023. Volume growth will be partially offset by the approximately $400 million impact from our previously discussed product exits including commodity glyphosate. And while we're seeing some slowing in the rate of inflation as well as overall supply chain improvements the operating environment is still dynamic. For the full year of 2023, we expect approximately 6% increase in market-driven cost headwinds including higher commodity prices, input costs, and freight and logistics. This impact should be largely weighted to the first half of the year reflecting seed commodity cost impact and the sell-through of higher cost inventory. This translates into high single-digit rate of inflation in the first half of the year dropping down to low single digit in the second half. In addition to these market-driven costs, we expect additional headwinds on other cost of sales. Importantly, the outlook includes approximately $100 million reduction in royalty expense and an additional $300 million of productivity and restructuring benefits. Another key element of our cost structure and consistent with our multiyear plan, we are increasing our investment in R&D in 2023. Regarding currency, we expect continued headwinds. Our assumption is for a weaker exchange rate relative to the dollar for several key currencies including the Brazilian real, the euro, and the Canadian dollar. We estimate 3% to 4% currency headwind on revenues and low double-digit headwind on EBITDA. Now, it's important to note the guidance does not include the impact of the biologicals acquisitions which are expected to close in the first half of the year. We'll provide an update for 2023 to include these acquisitions in the quarter in which they close. So, let's now go to slide 13 and summarize the key takeaways. We had great performance in 2022 with 15% growth in organic sales, more than 200 basis points of margin improvement, amidst a dynamic operating environment. We have favorable momentum and we'll carry that into 2023 and expect another year of strong performance in growth, supporting our 2025 financial targets. And finally, we're investing in innovation in the future of Corteva. We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy that is a balance of investing for growth or returning cash to shareholders. Since 2019, our capital deployment was heavily weighted towards returning cash to shareholders as we returned more than $3.6 billion through share repurchases and dividends. In 2023, against the backdrop of M&A, this distribution will be tilted towards investing for growth as we close on the previously announced biologicals acquisitions in the first half of the year. And with that, let me turn it over to Kim. Kim Booth : Thank you, Dave. Now, let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning everyone. Wondering if I could ask on the value creation program? Just it looks like there probably was some upside from that in the fourth quarter versus expectations just given how strong the quarter came in and what's normally a very weak quarter. Are you just finding that you're getting stuff done faster? Are you finding more stuff to do, or is it both? Chuck Magro : Good morning Vincent. That's right. So, look when we look at the performance for 2022, what I'd start with is we're very pleased with the year and we had a very strong year across the board and really focused on execution. Obviously, the market fundamentals are robust we've said that. We believe that, conditions are going to be constructive through 2023, and potentially into 2024 depending on supply demand. And when it comes to the value creation framework, right now, we'd say we're actually a little ahead of the plan and that's really driven by \u2013 we got after some of the portfolio decisions a little sooner than we thought. And we took some of the cost management actions, and you could see that hit the bottom line. If you look back to the value creation framework that we proposed in September, we indicated somewhere between 100 and 150 basis points per year. In 2022, we hit 200 basis points. So there's some acceleration there. We are finding new opportunities every day. So we'll give the market an update at the right time. But what I'd say right now is we're very comfortable with the $4.4 billion in the 21% to 23% margins by 2025. And 2022 sort of a reflection of that with a bit of an acceleration from some of the actions we took a little faster than we thought we could get after. Operator : And our next question will come from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Chuck on 2023 guidance the low end $3.4 billion. I guess, the question is why is this so low given the strong tailwinds we're seeing? I understand cost FX headwinds, but how conservative is that low end of the guidance range in your view? Chuck Magro : Yeah. Good morning. Let me give you the high-level view that, I have and then I'll ask Dave to talk about the low end but also the top end of the guidance range because there's a pathway to the top end as well. So first of all, what we'd say is the guidance range obviously fits nicely within the 2025 value creation framework. And as I mentioned already, we're on track and a little ahead of schedule. I'd say that, the guidance range also reflects some of the headwinds from the portfolio changes. So this is a big year of finalizing a lot of the country exits and the AI rationalization. Last year, we were pretty aggressive as I mentioned. We did over a dozen country exits last year alone, and we have a similar amount lined up for 2023. So, there'll be a lot of the portfolio decisions made in this year. And then finally, from a guidance perspective, there's a bit of a disconnect, and Dave will explain it in detail. We obviously included the higher interest rates to finance some of the growth particularly around Stoller and Symborg, but we did not include any of the earnings contribution from those acquisitions. So there's a bit of a mix there from a guidance perspective. Now, when you think about the guidance range, I'll have Dave talk about the specifics. Go ahead Dave. Dave Anderson : Sure. Yeah. So \u2013 good morning, by the way. And if you think about the high end of the guidance versus the midpoint of the guidance clearly more corn acres in the US would be a positive favorable cost realization of price would be a positive. And then we're also looking at some upside potential in terms of Brazil. To your point on the bottom end, it really still is very much a focus on our part on currency impacts and also just the dynamics in terms of the rate of inflation, which continues to be somewhat dynamic. We're seeing positive early indications on that, but that continues to be something, we're very, very focused on. So you can think of that and then of course in this business there's always Dave as you know, weather impacts that we would consider. Chuck mentioned, Symborg and Stoller. Our expectation is run rate for 2022 on those businesses in terms of EBITDA collectively is in the range of $120 million. So depending upon the time of the close and Chuck you may want to comment a little bit about that you could think of something like two-thirds of that coming through and actually benefiting us. And that reflects the fact as you know Stoller with being Latin America focused that would be towards the end of the year. Symborg really Europe some of that performance in earnings we won't really capture in 2023. But in 2024 in terms of run rate, we're going to see some very attractive contribution from both of those businesses, which will be very additive both obviously revenue added EBITDA and EBITDA margin additive for the company. Chuck, do you want to talk a little bit about timing? Chuck Magro : Yes. David, so if you recall in the prepared remarks, we mentioned closing the deal in the first half. We've got a bit more of an update, we've seen some of the regulatory filings come in. So, what we can say right now is that, we've received all the pre-closing regulatory approvals that are required for Symborg. So that's very good news and we expect that to be in a similar position with the Stoller transaction very soon. So, now we're thinking that we'll be able to close both of these acquisitions in Q1. So, a little earlier than we thought. And of course good news as Dave indicated, these are going to be good earnings contributions and will be accretive to EBITDA and certainly even accretive to margins. And as we look at it, we're pretty excited that this is a biologicals platform now that we'll be able to continue to grow. So we've got high aspirations for this part of our portfolio and it looks like we'll be able to close both of these transactions in Q1. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Cory Murphy : Good morning. This is Cory on for Kevin. And coming up with the 2023 free cash flow range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, what are your assumptions for working capital in 2023? Dave Anderson : Yes. Essentially what we've assumed particularly very importantly, a good question around inventory is our inventory levels in terms of inventory to revenue or inventory to sales be basically constant. So in other words that would end up than being -- inventory would be a contribution. The change on the change would be a contribution to cash in 2023. Two of the key items beyond working capital they're very important and somewhat embedded in my prepared remarks earlier. One was the expectation for higher interest expense. Obviously, both amount of debt, but also the rate on that debt in 2023. That will flow through as a cash use for incrementally '23 compared to '22. And then the other one is higher cash taxes. That's predominantly related to the R&D tax credit phenomena if you will the capitalization amortization as opposed to expense benefit that we've been receiving. We're not unique in terms of that challenge and of course, that's something that's going to continue to be very much the focus of legislative lobbying because it's really we think highly punitive. So it's really working capital actually ending up net of increase in receivables, being a source of cash and then higher usage of cash on both the interest and on the tax side. Chuck Magro : Yes, Dave, maybe it's a bit more instructive to talk a little bit about working capital and specifically the inventory. If you go back to 2020 and 2021, obviously, the entire industry Corteva included had significant supply chain challenges right across the board. We saw raw material shortages, logistics challenges and as a result we were forced to draw down our inventories to what we would consider to be unhealthy, unsustainable levels and our service levels for our customers, especially around some of the products that are very unique to Corteva. So think about our seed portfolio, but also think about the Enlist platform, these service levels became unacceptable. So, last year we saw an opportunity to rebuild those inventories. We feel now that we've got the right service levels in place to support our customers. And don't forget the global CP market is expected to grow mid-single digits this year. So we're preparing for another good year in agriculture. We're preparing for another good year of growth and we feel we've got the service levels now to support our customers, very important. Operator : And our next question will come from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Joel Jackson : Hi, good morning. Just want to ask a question on free cash flow conversion. So, I think you've been targeting about 50%. You talked about getting a 42% average cross 2021 to '22. Can you talk about why the free cash flow conversion is a little bit lower in '23? And then, thinking about that question and thinking about some of your acquisitions this year, what kind of share buyback capacity do you have this year? Dave Anderson : Sure, Joel. The sort of the short answer on the free cash flow conversion for 2023 relates to the points I made in the previous question which really have to do with the higher -- on a year-over-year basis, higher cash taxes and higher interest. There's some other factors in there, but those are the biggest components of that. In terms of capital allocation, as you know -- and we've really demonstrated that balance in terms of our overall capital allocation with history if you will up through 2022 very much of course weighted towards returning cash to shareholders. And that was I think very, very smartly executed during that period of time. 2023 is going to be much more significantly tilted towards growth and specifically M&A with the Stoller and Symborg acquisitions. We anticipate continuing on our share buyback, but that's going to be at a -- likely will be at a reduced level just given the significance of those acquisitions. Operator : And our next question will come from Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Christopher Parkinson : One of the best success stories I think Corteva in 2022 was just the progress you've made in CPC margins. You laid out some helpful framework in the PowerPoint, but if you could just offer some further color on first of all just obviously the price/cost environment new product growth the exit of certain business lines. It seems like things are probably ahead of schedule as it pertains to your longer-term margin guidance. So just any additional framework you could offer on that would be very helpful? Thank you so much. Dave Anderson : Let me introduce very quickly and then I'll turn it over to Robert for his comments. You're exactly right Chris. I mean, it's the combination of those things. The focus on differentiated products new products what we've been able to do in terms of managing headwinds associated with by the way not only cost inflation in terms of material cost or market-driven costs, but also currency. It's been a big headwind for both businesses to include crop. So the setup right now I think for 2023 is positive. The thing to keep in mind of course and Chuck mentioned that I mentioned it in my prepared remarks is the headwind -- just the volume headwind that's associated with the product and geographic exits particularly the product exits for crop in 2023. Robert., do you want to talk a little bit about some of the formula? Robert King : Sure. Yes Chris when you look at 2022 just a quick recap on how do we do it and what were some of the key drivers there. Dave hit on a few of them, but it really starts out with our strategy around price for value and productivity. We continue to be able to offset inflation in that year of -- inflation was about 10% as you roll the year up and yet we were able to continue to put new technology on the ground and the demand for it continues to grow up -- continues to go up with the growers. Our new product growth finished up about 33% as you've seen. And this is really a good story around that technology that continues to be a pull into the market. So these types of things with our supply chain becoming more resilient. We delivered nearly 10% more volume last year. This will be the continued story into 2023, as we begin to look at how will we manage margins what's that look like and how do we get through the year. We're going to continue to follow our price for value strategy. We do expect we'll have a little headwinds in the first half of the year for inflation and we'll work with that and productivity to continue to offset that. And then really what you look at in 2022 is structural changes that we're making and with the exits that have started we will finish up. It will be about 70% done with all of our AI exits in 2023. So 2023 really becomes a transformation year that we begin to change our portfolio and position us for even better margin accretion as we move forward into the future. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Patrick Cunningham : Hi. Good morning. This is Patrick Cunningham on for P.J. In crop volumes in the quarter Crop Protection were down outside of North America and it seems like fungicides took a pretty big hit. Can you walk us through why the Crop chem volumes were so weak in the quarter? Thank you. Dave Anderson : Sure. Q4 is one that played out really in South America for us and Latin America. As you look at the big volumes, we had a strong Northern Hemisphere with Enlist continuing to go to fill tanks and took over a lot of tanks this Q4. But in Latin America the drought is really bad. When it comes to Argentina and Southern Brazil and so the fungicide growth that we typically would see there we thought we would see didn't come through just wasn't in demand. And so that's really what the difference was in Q4 when you look at volumes. The other thing, I would mention is roll back to Q4 2021 Brazil had mid-20s growth in that quarter alone and so had a huge mountain to compare against as well when you begin to look at Q4 versus Q4. Operator : And we have a question from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Thank you very much. This is [indiscernible] filling in for Steve. Just wanted to ask about the settlement charges you're taking on Lorsban. I think this was the third quarter this year that you took a charge. And given that can you start providing commentary on what you expect next year for any charges? And what is -- as we think about that I think $7 million this year what is the cash flow impact from these settlements? Are they mostly for future cash flow impacted? Have you already paid the settlement? How should we think about that? Dave Anderson : Yes. This is Dave. So as we -- as you know we really have not provided -- cannot provide any kind of forward view. There's just no estimate that's available that would allow us to do that. We do -- we'll have an $87 million charge for the full year of 2022. There's just at this time limited forecast visibility as to what that would translate to in terms of 2023 and we've really just not prepared to comment on that. In the same way on the cash side, I mean, I think that's very, very much a TBD. We'll obviously update as actuals occur and actuals progress. Operator : And our next question will come from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Yes. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the Crop Protection Chemical. Growth that you saw in new products, obviously, that was a nice success story for 2022. The original guidance was for $300 million increase in 2022 and you came in at $475 million and you're guiding again for $300 million in 2023. So I'm wondering what went right in 2022? And what could go right in 2023, or what could go wrong in 2023? Dave Anderson : Frank, thanks. Hopefully more goes right than wrong in 2023. But as you begin to look at new products, yes, we had a great year finishing up about $1.9 billion for the year in the sales of those products. And as you stated there $475 million increase. The strengths around it really centered around three big molecules that led this. Enlist primarily with the demand that we're following with Tim in the seed. And we're 80-plus percent at our last estimate now of acres over-the-top spray with Enlist. Arylex in Latin America -- excuse me in Europe was a strong performer as well. And as you know this herbicide is one that has a growing demand also. And then finally I would say our insecticide of Inatreq was the third one that was a standout there that helping us grow this. When you begin to roll that now forward to 2023 we expect that our new products will continue to see high-teens growth. It's going to have -- those three products will be well over $300 million each in total revenue and the upside there is that it's going to depend on more demand from our technology. It's strong and we don't see a whole lot of downside from the new products primarily because farm fundamentals are healthy. Growers are sitting on good profits. And then with that they're trying to maximize value and to do that you turn to new technologies to do that and that's where we come to play in this area. So this is a good story that really helps us play out I guess a proof point of our strategy to build more differentiated portfolio and these new products are a key piece of that. Chuck Magro : Yes. Frank, maybe I'll add one other point. It's not necessarily a new product, but we've got the new Spinosyns franchise capacity that will come into the market in 2023. So beyond what Robert said around that existing portfolio, we've got a capacity expansion and one of the most profitable franchises we've got with Spinosyns and that will start to go into the market, the new capacity this year. So we're looking forward to good things from that franchise as well. Operator : And moving on to Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. So just looking at the guidance, it looks like you've noted that the cost headwinds are largely weighted to 1H 2023. Is there any potential for maybe cost to surprise to the downside or upside? How would you kind of look at that? And if so is the pricing that you have in place sufficient to offset some higher costs if there is any possible increase, or would you be able to enact pricing to offset that? I'm just wondering what drives the lower end of your range there. Dave Anderson : Maybe I could just introduce and then Tim and Robert you guys could comment respectively on your business. As we said, and you correctly stated that the majority of our call it market driven headwinds. So think of that as commodity and input costs as well as freight and logistics. The majority of that on a year-over-year basis will occur -- about 80% of that in terms of our forecast is going to occur in the first half and we'll see improvement/relief. Still we've got those costs going up but at a much more modest rate in the second half of the year. In the big picture on the pricing as we expect as we did in 2022 that we'll see seed pricing more than offset those commodity cost increases. And on Crop Protection we'll see the ability to cover those costs. And by the way it also offset the currency impacts that we've built into the guide the EBITDA approaches I shared with you earlier. Tim, you want to comment a little bit more about seed? Tim Glenn : Yeah. Dave on the seed side, I'd say for the first half we have a very good understanding of what our seed costs are that seed we would have produced last year. And so consider in the barn and well-understood in terms of the cost that we have there and we've been live in the marketplace with pricing for really since August in North America. And given where we're at in the market, we got great performance, very good demand for our technology. And I would describe our pricing as being well accepted in the marketplace. And again that's largely driven by good value proposition our ability to go out there and demonstrate value to our customers. So North America in a great spot. We've been live in Europe for about three months and again understood what our cost position was. And again pricing I was in Europe last week and our pricing is holding well in the marketplace and great implementation. You think about exposure for the rest of the year on seed. Latin America we're still in the field, producing our seed in Brazil especially but also Argentina. And so we have a little bit more exposure if you will in terms of those costs, but obviously we're working hard and we factor that in I think to our guide so far. And in terms of pricing, we still have flexibility there. We're not live in the marketplace per se. And so we're going to continue to evaluate where we're at there. We got a great track record of capturing value in Latin America and so we believe we're positioned very well for value -- strong value proposition. Again we've got an excellent track record in terms of being able to capture value and confident that we're going to be able to more than offset what that inflation pressure is. Robert King : And in Crop Protection, just to add a little bit to that is that we continue to see as I said before mid-single digits inflation that will continue with us. It will be heavier in the first half than the second half, but our price for value strategy and productivity will continue to help offset that. So far we're seeing good progress in all of our markets with what we're doing and what we're going to market with. And the other thing I'd say is just a comment that one of the key indicators for us is what's going on in the generic market and how is pricing holding there. And all the leading generic producers have come out and said that prices are stable for the first half of the year from what they can see so far. And so that's always a good indicator for us as well as what's price going on there. So we expect we can offset the cost using the same strategy that we've used in the past for Crop Protection. Operator : And our next question will come from Joshua Spector with UBS. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is Lucas on for Josh. I just wanted to go back to the path for the 2025 targets. So, looking at your EBITDA for this year, I mean that seems to be progressing pretty ratably. You sort of highlighted why your free cash flow is going to be depressed in the next year. So you're kind of looking at like a mid-30s conversion versus the 55 to 75 target. So could you just kind of help us bridge how the free cash flow is going to converge there towards the target range? And if you see any risk there now given it's sort of more back weighted versus what's happening with EBITDA. Dave Anderson : I think I would just comment that we've got on a year-over-year basis, obviously, those additional headwinds that I mentioned to you. The other thing that I would mention is that we will get the cash contribution over time from acquisitions. It's not going to be significant, but it will be important to the overall equation. But the other thing is just the growth in EBITDA that's going to occur over that period of time. So, we also see some call it improvement as we look to more normal patterns in terms of the cost and inflation issues and some of the supply chain issues that we've been dealing with and the industry have been dealing with in general. All of those are going to be able to be contributors towards the targets that we've talked about. And by the way just to reinforce again, the 2022 performance combined with the 2022-2023 guide is again a very important statement we think we're making about the attainment of those 2025 numbers. Chuck Magro : Yes. Dave maybe just a couple more minutes on this topic. Look, when we, Dave and I look at the free cash flow conversion, it is obviously a focus for the company. So if you think about what we've done as an organization, we started with the portfolio and the strategy and then the operating model for Corteva. And I think we've made a lot of progress in 12 months in those areas. So now the next level of focus, obviously, is looking at the cash conversion. It is a high priority for the management team. It's a complete focus for us. And as we make the structural changes to the portfolio, I mentioned we still have some country exits, some AI exits. That's going to be looked at through the lens of earnings of margin but also of cash generation. And that was always the plan. So what I'd say is we're very comfortable with the path that we're on and by the time we get to the end of 2023 from a margin and EBITDA perspective, we're going to be halfway through this journey. And we believe that there's a pathway to get free cash flow conversion sort of north of where it is today as well and that will be a primary focus as we look through the rest of the portfolio changes that we're planning to make. Operator : And moving on to Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to maybe come into the some of the market assumptions that you have both at the industry level and at the Corteva level for 2023 and just maybe on the Crop Protection side. And I know there's some noise related to the portfolio exits, but mid-single-digit kind of market CPC growth. Help me think about Corteva volumes organically for Corteva in that context? And any maybe differentiation by region? And along those lines kind of where you see channel inventories kind of going into 2023 in your key kind of operating regions? Robert King : Adam, thanks for the question of what's going on in the market. It's going to be a dynamic year. But as we look at it it's \u2013 we're expecting the market organic growth to be in the mid-single digits call it 4% to 7% with biologicals outstripping that. It will be the fastest-moving segment. Overall, the demand continues very strong across all regions. And again, it's \u2013 growers are chasing yield and that's where we \u2013 that's our sweet spot I guess is what I would say with the products we have. You asked about channel inventory, and right now we see inventory to be about normal across all regions with a few hotspots around some pockets that we're going to have to watch. One being, we talked about earlier the fungicide in Latin America is elevated a bit. To a lesser extent Europe not near as much but in a couple of areas in Europe. And then insecticide in Asia is elevated as well because it's just been vet not have pest pressures. But if you roll all that together, those inventory levels from what we see in the channels is very manageable across the year, across the seasons. No issues there from a standpoint of will it work itself out. We do see that the pace of price for the year flattening as compared to a year-over-year comparison. But we \u2013 like we said before, mid-single-digit inflation we're still expecting for crop protection. Again more weighted towards the first half. I think the thing to watch is the global supply chain. So all things are trending in the right direction. If you look at all the key indicators for the global supply chain market. But what I would say is it's stable. It's not getting any worse for the first time in a while. And I guess, I'm cautiously optimistic that that continues to improve but that's one to watch as well to see how does that drive the market as we move into this year. So overall from a market standpoint, it's poised to have a really good year and we think we're sitting in a pretty good position across all levels there as well. Maybe a couple of comments on seed. Chuck Magro : Yes. Go ahead, Tim. Tim Glenn : Yes. I think Adam, when you think a seed this year, one of the big movers obviously is the shift back towards corn here in North America. We believe we'll have an increased area in both corn and beans, but that tilt towards corn is very important. Clearly for us, we were still operating in a very healthy environment as well. Customers are generally good in terms of what their farmer income is and there's certainly as always demand for the latest and best technology that's going to help them be most productive. The dynamics between corn and soy, we watch that all the time up through final decision-making and it continues to tilt towards corn. And I'm comfortable with that current 91, 89 as reasonable assumption. Around the world, certainly dynamics are different than what we see here in North America. In Europe, I'd say that we're probably more expecting corn to be flat-ish in the marketplace and that's driven by a couple of markets including Ukraine impacting that. Latin America, still strong momentum there. Certainly, we're in the midst of planting this safrinha season and here in a few months we'll be out selling next summer corn, as well as soybeans and then on to safrinha. That all comes very fast, but still tremendous growth across Latin America and no reason to see that hectares won't be up, not just this season, but also in the coming seasons as well for Brazil in particular. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to John Roberts with Credit Suisse. Edlain Rodriguez : Thank you. Good morning. Actually, this is Edlain Rodriguez. A quick follow-up on seed for Tim. I mean, this is the first time in a long time where the seed business has a positive EBITDA in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about how sustainable that trend is going forward? And also, with minus, what's driving that change? Tim Glenn : Yes. I mean, we -- I'd say, fourth quarter for us, it's our second smallest quarter. Let's not forget that. We're heavily, heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. And the big driver in the fourth quarter is certainly Latin America, the live market that we have and that tends to be somewhat -- it can change between fourth and first quarter, depending upon how timely that safrinha season starts. And this year, I'd say, we had a timely start to the season and very strong demand for product in Latin America. I think you're also seeing, here in North America, our business. We don't move a lot of Pioneer through the rep model, because that business is direct-to-farmer. And so, very little of that has taken place at this time of the year, but we are seeing an increase in the importance of Brevant in our multi-channel business and we would expect that to continue on. So it's never kind of set in stone. There's still some seasonality elements depending upon how the year is going, but, obviously, part of it was pricing, part of it was volume and certainly those are healthy factors. And we expect to see Latin America business continue to grow over time, so that late -- end of the year business is going to be there and we expect our multi-channel on Brevant business to continue to grow. So that's certainly a factor that supported the fourth quarter, but it's a little bit of luck and obviously good execution here because it was driven by customer demand. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now hand the call back over to Kim Booth. Kim Booth : Thank you. And that concludes today's call. We thank you for joining and for your interest in Corteva. We hope you have a safe and wonderful day. Operator : Well, thank you. That does conclude today's conference.

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Kim Booth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kim Booth : Good morning and welcome to Corteva\u2019s first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Chuck Magro, Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Anderson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Tim Glenn, Executive Vice President, Seed Business Unit; and Robert King, Executive Vice President, Crop Protection business unit, will join the Q&A session. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks during this call, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of the Corteva website and through the link to our webcast. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements which are our expectations about the future. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could materially differ from these statements due to these risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those discussed on this call and in the Risk Factors section of our reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please note in today\u2019s presentation, we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release and related schedules along with our supplemental financial summary slide deck available on our Investor Relations website. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Magro : Thanks, Kim. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. We are really pleased to report another solid quarter and a solid start to 2023, where we delivered double-digit organic sales and earnings growth alongside meaningful margin expansion. It is the first time we have crossed the 25% EBITDA margin threshold in Q1, which is a milestone for the company and our value creation journey and shows just how far we have come. Today, we are also updating our previously announced guidance for the full year. Net sales are now expected to grow 7% and operating EBITDA 13% at the midpoint over prior year. Operating EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.80 to $3. This outlook reflects the power of our strategy and the strength of execution in a dynamic ag market. Strategically, we continue to make choices to strengthen our portfolio mix and accelerate growth and margin expansion. Our actions are translating into higher quality earnings. We remain on track with regard to our 2025 value creation plan and are focused on continuing to deliver on our targets. Let me provide a few highlights of progress we are making in each business. In seed, we recently announced the commercial launch of Vorceed Enlist. Our next-generation corn rootworm protection products, that includes the power of the Enlist weed control system. As a reminder, we expect the U.S. soybean market penetration percentage for Enlist to be in the mid-50s this year. On Brevant, our growing retail brand, which is serving as a catalyst for growth in the medium-term, we continue to see robust demand and market acceptance. In Crop Protection, we continue to drive penetration of our recent technology launches with new product sales of approximately $620 million, a 30% increase over prior year. This was led by products like Enlist and Arylex herbicides, which each grew more than 50% over the same quarter last year. I am also pleased with the advancements we have made in all three of our frontier markets in the first quarter. We see tremendous opportunity in the high-growth, high-value areas of bio-fuels, specialty oils and proteins as well as biologicals. These growth markets will deliver increased optionality and value to our customers and allow us to work with partners to create new value chains and cropping systems that will increase both food and fuel security. In bio-fuels, our collaboration with Bunge and Chevron will increase the supply of lower carbon renewable fuels in the U.S. by using our proprietary winter canola hybrids in a new double cropping system. We are also collaborating with Bunge to develop and commercialize a more nutritious soybean meal for the animal feed industry in the U.S. aimed at reducing the use of synthetic feed additives. In biologicals, we successfully acquired Stoller and Symborg in the first quarter. With the addition of these two strong companies, we have cemented ourselves as one of the largest players in this rapidly growing segment. Biologicals are expected to represent about 25% of the global crop protection market by 2035, driven by increasing demand for effective, sustainable solutions. Importantly, the ag fundamentals remain constructive, underpinned by the profitability of farmers. There has been no change in farmer priorities. They are investing in productivity and yields and we expect that to continue. As anticipated, we are seeing buying patterns normalize, something we haven\u2019t experienced in a few years. This dynamic is not surprising and is healthy for agriculture in the longer term and the strategic portfolio decisions we made last year will allow us to thrive as we enter this next phase of normalization. Now, let\u2019s go through more specifics on the market outlook. We continue to see tight grain and oilseed inventories around the world with crop prices above historical averages. Strong demand, combined with tight supply and weather-related reductions in estimated yields drove low stocks-to-use ratios for both corn and soybeans during the \u201822/23 crop year. We continue to believe that global grain and oilseed markets need two consecutive normal crop years to stabilize global supplies and it\u2019s too early to tell whether this year will be a year of rebuilding. We expect these trends to continue throughout the year, given current commodity prices and the fact that productivity on the farm from top ag technologies is the best way for farmers to manage their businesses. Turning to the U.S. planted area, we expect farmers to plant 92 million acres of corn, up 4% year-over-year and around 88 million acres of soybeans essentially flat year-over-year. Projected farmer incomes are strong in 2023 though slightly lower than 2022 and the record we saw in 2021. Finally, when we look at the Brazil market, the farmer is financially healthy, investing in maximizing crop production and all indications are that they will plant more soybeans and safrinha corn this coming season than they did last year. In order to do this, they will need our technology to drive and protect yields. The strength in these two key markets is helping offset planted area and yield reductions in other parts of the world, including Ukraine and Argentina. Let\u2019s shift gears to our 2025 value creation framework. In September, we announced a new financial objective to deliver $4.4 billion of EBITDA on $20 billion of revenue by 2025. To achieve this, we focused on four value catalysts to accelerate EBITDA growth and earnings quality : portfolio simplification, royalty neutrality, product mix improvements and operational excellence. These are significantly under our control and we are making good progress in each area. We are planning on completing about 85% of our 32 planned country exits and about 60% of our AI exits by the end of this year. On our path to royalty neutrality, we expect to generate an additional $100 million of EBITDA in 2023 largely driven by our Enlist transition. In Crop Protection, we are creating sustainable differentiated products. We plan to launch 9 new AIs by 2035 on top of the 9 launched since 2017. And finally, on operational excellence, were improved \u2013 the improvements across the company are driving price and productivity actions, we now expect to deliver approximately $300 million in savings in just 2023 alone. Disciplined execution against this value creation plan is expected to translate into compounded EBITDA growth that would put us to between 21% and 23% EBITDA margins by 2025. This is a significant increase from where we started just a few years ago and it includes a sizable increase in R&D investment. And with that, let me turn it over to Dave to provide details on our financial performance as well as updates on the 2023 outlook. Dave Anderson : Thanks, Chuck and welcome everyone to the call. Let\u2019s start on Slide 7, which provides the financial results for the quarter. As Chuck said and you can see from the numbers, we have had a strong start to the year. Compared to the first quarter of 2022, organic sales increased 10% with gains in both segments, led by North America and EMEA. Global pricing was up 14%, with good price execution in both seed and crop protection. The pricing included management of currency headwinds, primarily in Central and Eastern Europe. Volumes for the quarter are down as expected, reflecting the strategic portfolio actions in the exit from Russia. In total, for the quarter, these exits represent $190 million or a 4% headwind. Feed volumes were down largely due to tight supply and drought conditions in Latin America, coupled with our exit from Russia. Crop Protection volumes were down 1% in the quarter versus prior year, with new product growth offset by unfavorable weather conditions in Latin America, in Asia Pacific and our previously announced product exits. The strong top line performance translated into operating EBITDA of more than $1.2 billion for the quarter, an increase of 18%. Pricing, product mix and productivity more than offset higher input costs and currency headwinds, driving more than 260 basis points of margin expansion. Let\u2019s now go to Slide 8, where you can see the reported sales by business. Seed net sales were up 7% in the quarter to $2.7 billion. Organic sales were up 10% on strong price execution as we continue our strategy to price for value and also offset higher input costs. We delivered pricing gains in every region led by EMEA, which more than offset currency headwinds in that region. Seed volumes were down 7% versus prior year, with volume up in North America driven by soybean delivery timing and in APAC driven by demand for new technology. These gains were more than offset by volume declines in Latin America and EMEA and EMEA seed volumes were down as expected due to our 2022 decision to exit Russia coupled with lower corn planted area. Now excluding the Russia impact, seed volume would have been down 4% in the quarter. Declines in Latin America seed volumes were largely driven by a shortened Brazilian safrinha season due to delayed soybean harvest and supply constraints in the region as well as the strength of Brazil\u2019s fourth quarter 2022. As you will recall, growers in Brazil accelerated purchases last year with concerns regarding product availability and supply. Crop Protection net sales were up 5% compared to the prior year to $2.2 billion. Organic sales were up 10% in the quarter, driven by broad-based pricing gains, reflecting pricing for the value of our differentiated technology as well as to offset higher raw materials globally and currency in EMEA. Crop Protection volumes were down 1% impacted by an approximate $90 million headwind from our strategic portfolio actions notably the exit of commodity glyphosate and our exit from Russia. Crop Protection was up 3%, excluding the impact of these exits. Continued penetration of new products added $140 million of incremental net sales growth as customer demand for Enlist and Arylex herbicides was strong in the quarter. Currency headwinds on both business units, was 5% largely driven by European currencies. And finally, you\u2019ll recall we closed on the biologicals acquisitions on March 1, which added approximately $19 million of sales in the quarter. With that, let\u2019s go to Slide 9 for a summary of the first quarter operating EBITDA performance. Operating EBITDA increased more than $190 million to $1.23 billion. Pricing and product mix driven by customer demand for yield advantage technology more than offset higher cost and currency headwinds. We incurred approximately $360 million of market-driven inflation and other across both businesses in the quarter. Seed saw higher commodity costs and yield impacts from dry weather in EMEA and Latin America. Crop Protection raw material costs were up 7% versus prior year as we sold through higher cost inventory and we delivered approximately $75 million in productivity savings which partially offset these headwinds. SG&A as a percent of sales was down 140 basis points compared to the first quarter of the prior year as we maintain disciplined spending in execution on cost actions and also reflects the timing benefit of commissions expense. Investment in R&D was up roughly $50 million in the quarter, aligned with targeted spend increases to support our leading position in ag technology. Now, you can learn more about the R&D pipeline and technology investments at our R&D innovation update call on May 9. Kim is going to provide more details on that at the end of this call. Now, portfolio and other gains in the quarter were driven by $7 million of EBITDA from the biologicals acquisitions in the month of March as well as a favorable impact from the absence of the remeasurement of an equity investment, which was sold in the first half of 2022. Currency was $172 million headwind and driven primarily by European currencies. Turning to Slide 10, I want to provide an update on our full year guidance. The setup for Corteva in 2023 remains positive and we are raising our full year revenue, earnings and cash flow guidance. Now changes to the guidance are driven by the inclusion of the biologicals acquisitions as well as some favorability from the strong operational performance in the first quarter, which is also included in the full year outlook. We now expect net sales to be in the range of $18.6 billion to $18.9 billion or 7% growth at the midpoint. This includes approximately $450 million of additional sales in biologicals. Operating EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $3.55 billion to $3.75 billion, an increase of $150 million over our original full year guidance. At the midpoint, the updated range represents a 13% increase over prior year and it includes approximately $90 million from the acquisitions, net of roughly $20 million of integration costs. And importantly, as we are starting to see our strategic portfolio actions translate into higher quality earnings, we now expect EBITDA margin of 19.5% at the midpoint of guidance or 100 basis points of margin expansion over prior year. It\u2019s another indication we are on track to achieve the 2025 value creation framework targets. Operating EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.80 to $3 per share, an increase of 9% versus the prior year at the midpoint, $0.10 higher than our original guidance, reflecting improved operating performance as well as the earnings from the acquisitions partially offset by the increased depreciation and amortization related to purchase accounting. We expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, an increase of $100 million at the midpoint from our previous guidance. That increase largely reflects higher earnings, coupled with an update to the 2023 capital spending forecast. And finally, related to capital allocation. We remain committed to a balanced strategy, returning excess cash to shareholders while investing for growth. In the first quarter, we returned approximately $360 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases and we expect to complete a total of $500 million of share repurchases for the year. With that, let\u2019s go to Slide 11. I want to provide some color on our outlook for the first half and full year. It\u2019s an important reference in light of the shifts in order patterns that we are seeing due largely to weather and reversions to more normalized conditions for supply chains. Specifically, our first half seed growth will be driven by continued pricing momentum and increased U.S. corn acres. However, seed volume growth in the U.S. is expected to be more than offset for the shortened safrinha season, supply constraints in Latin America, coupled with approximately $200 million headwind to volume related to our exit from Russia. For Crop Protection, first half volumes are expected to be down as growth from new products will be offset by more than $200 million of strategic product exits. Additionally, we see customer buying behavior returning to historical patterns driven by improvement in supply chain reliability as well as higher interest rates, particularly in Latin America. In LatAm, we saw significant growth in the first half of 2022 and with more than one-third of Latin America\u2019s full year sales delivered in the period. In 2023, we expect the sales pattern to reflect more normalized timing shifting more of the sales to the second half, so more like pre-2022 order pattern for the region. Here is a couple of other summary points. As expected, cost inflation will be higher in the first half of the year due to the sell-through of higher crop protection inventory and the seasonal timing of higher seed input costs. We expect the rate of inflation to be high single digits for the first half of the year moderating to low to mid-single digits in the second half. Currency headwinds will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, driven again by European currencies and the seasonal pattern of sales in EMEA. And consistent with our previous expectations, total company pricing is expected to be up mid-single digits for the year. The double-digit pricing gains reflected in the first quarter are expected to moderate as a portion of that pricing in the quarter was in response to currency headwinds in EMEA. Operational efficiencies will drive improvement in SG&A. In fact, we expect that excluding the biologicals acquisitions, SG&A will be effectively flat compared to prior year. And finally, approximately 80% of the full year EBITDA from biologicals acquisitions will be delivered in the second half, reflecting Stoller\u2019s seasonal pattern. So in summary, we expect roughly 80% of our full year earnings to be in the first half of the year, which implies lower year-over-year growth in both revenue and EBITDA in the second quarter relative to the average that we\u2019re now forecasting for the first half of the year. And with that, let\u2019s go to Slide 12 and summarize the key takeaways. The year is obviously off to a great start with first quarter growth led by EMEA in North America. The quarter\u2019s performance sets us up well for another year of delivering results. While we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re on track to deliver our full year guidance, we expect a greater percentage of revenue and earnings in the second half of the year compared to 2022, largely driven by supply chain improvement and normalization in customer buying behaviors. We\u2019re raising our full year guidance, largely driven by the biologicals acquisitions and operational performance. Importantly, we remain confident that we\u2019re on track to deliver on our 2025 financial targets. And with that, let me turn it over to Kim. Kim Booth : Thank you, Dave. On Slide 13, I what to briefly share the key topics of our upcoming R&D innovation update. As a reminder, the virtual event will be held this coming Tuesday May 9 at 9.30 a.m. Eastern. It will be a 90 minute webcast including 30 minutes of Q&A. Chuck and Sam Eathington, our Chief Technology and Digital Officer, will provide more detail on our leading pipeline and insights into how and where we are choosing to invest in R&D. Registration details are available on our website and we look forward to your participation at the event. I\u2019d also like to take a second to highlight that we released our 2022 sustainability and ESG report on April 4, which is available on our website. Now let\u2019s move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Just a question on pricing. In Europe, crop chem, the pricing was very strong and you referenced sort of pricing for value initiatives. So if you could just give us a little bit more detail on what you\u2019re doing there and how new or different it is? And then also, if you could just talk a little bit about U.S. seed pricing, which came in at 7%. If you could give us some color on soy seed pricing versus corn seed pricing? Thank you. Chuck Magro : Good morning, Vincent. So I\u2019ll have Robert and Tim answer those questions. Just let me give you a couple of other comments to the stage when it comes to price. So as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we\u2019re seeing very good demand. The underlying demand on the farm is still strong. And that underpins our forward thinking. Obviously, it underpins the guidance that we put out today. And we\u2019re just seeing a willingness around the world for farmers to maximize yield and productivity. It is really one of the few tools they have to ensure that they are going to be profitable long term. So maybe, Robert, you want to answer Vincent\u2019s question on CP? Robert King : Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Chuck. Like Chuck was talking about, the underlying demand remains unchanged. So when you begin to look at what is price for value when we talk about that, it\u2019s the same strategy that we\u2019ve had across the last year as well, where we say, we\u2019re looking at our differentiated products, our new products that give a new technology, a different technology to the growers that really helps them begin to add value to their farm. And it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s an opportunity for them to be able to protect yield and improve yield. So when we talk about price for value, we\u2019re talking about \u2013 we\u2019re going to price in such a way that the farmers are getting to add value, and we\u2019re getting paid for our technology. And so it\u2019s a strategy we\u2019ve used over the last year, and we will continue to use this with price and productivity to help offset the inflation and FX that we\u2019ve had over the last year and that you\u2019ve seen in the first quarter. Chuck Magro : Tim? Tim Glenn : Hey, good morning, Vincent. So our North America pricing, obviously off to a strong start in terms of pricing. And I\u2019d say it\u2019s turning out consistent with our expectations, clearly driven by our strong value proposition. And in terms of our ability to execute in the field, I think we\u2019ve got several years of demonstrating that we\u2019re going to get paid for value that we deliver. In terms of the mix between corn and soy, I\u2019d say the first quarter soy numbers, there is a little bit of an anomaly in that in the sense that we had a route-to-market change. And so it\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s showing up at about 1% on soy in the first quarter, and that\u2019s going to be lower than what we would expect over the course of the season. The route-to-market change is driven by the move from direct sales in the South and mid-South to dealer sales. And so instead of paying a commission on the back end, it\u2019s an off-invoice discount. So our gross price is different under the two models. But in the end, what our margins \u2013 it will demonstrate pricing there. In terms of how the season has gone, I\u2019d say, as competitive as normal, farmers have been very committed to corn and very strong corn orders throughout the season. And soybeans are always just a little bit more competitive. But I\u2019d say playing out as we expect and I think representative of what we will see over the course of the season. Operator : And our next question will come from Joel Jackson with BMO. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning, everyone. This is Joseph on for Joel. So just in terms of free cash flow, which moved up to 36% this quarter, what would be some of the opportunities to move that above 40%? And what work are you guys doing in that area? Chuck Magro : Dave, why don\u2019t you take that question? Dave Anderson : Sure. Yes. So as we cited on prepared remarks in our release, we\u2019re raising the guide for the year. That really reflects two things. One is the higher EBITDA, the higher earnings. We also just fine-tuned. It\u2019s not that significant, but it\u2019s part of the math, fine-tune our CapEx full year forecast. In terms of improvement for here, there is a lot that\u2019s going on in the organization and in both businesses that\u2019s really giving us greater confidence in terms of our cash flow for the year. On the other side of the equation, what we have is with some of the timing difference in terms of the distribution between 1H and 2H. We\u2019ve obviously going to be carrying a little bit more working capital, including as you would suspect, we will have receivables balances that will be weighted now more significantly than our original forecast towards the second half and towards the end of the year. So it\u2019s really the balance of those items. I think as we look into \u201824 and \u201825, we remain very confident in our ability to continue to increased cash flow as well as cash flow conversion. And by the way, just to tell you a little bit about the conversion numbers, that conversion for 2023, the midpoint, the $1.3 billion free cash flow represents about 63% of our operating earnings. So if you will, the free cash flow divided by our operating earnings forecast, it\u2019s implied with our EBITDA update, our EPS update, which compared to EBITDA of used EBITDA then as the denominator, it would be more in the neighborhood of about 35%. So it also gives you some relative measures. But we\u2019re very, very confident looking forward that we\u2019ve got the ability to continue to drive towards the kind of numbers that you mentioned in the 40% and then even into the 50% range on cash flow conversion as it relates to EBITDA as the denominator. Operator : And our next question will come from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Good morning. With regard to crop protection, it sounds like you\u2019re seeing good underlying demand. Would you comment on your current view of channel inventories around the world? I think you made a comment in the prepared remarks that buyer patterns were normalizing here. And just curious on what you think that could do to the volume experience as the year progresses? Thank you. Chuck Magro : Okay, Kevin, how are you? Robert, why don\u2019t you take that question? Robert King : Kevin, when you begin to look at our tenant inventory, we track our distributor inventory as well as our product-to-ground. So we have a pretty good handle on what\u2019s going on in the channel from our inventory standpoint. And when you look at it across the regions, they are full as they should be at this time of the year, especially in North America. But overall, for Corteva, we\u2019re about normal. The two hotspots are two exceptions. One is in Asia, where we have insecticide inventory in the channel that is elevated but we do believe we\u2019re in a better position there than the industry is from a standpoint of channel inventory there that it will work itself out across the second half of the year. And in Latin America, fungicide obviously, is one that is up, as we talked about in Q4 and as we got into the drought. So fungicide is something there that also we believe with normal weather will work itself out across the year also. When you begin to look at the shift that we talk about there and how does that impact channel inventory, really, it\u2019s just the shift of first half, second half that we\u2019re talking about. And that\u2019s the normalization of buying that\u2019s happening right now that we\u2019re seeing in Crop Protection. And this really has a lot of things to do with the supply chain getting better. Disruptions aren\u2019t totally gone but they are manageable now. And so the supply chains have plenty of availability for the farmers. So with that, they don\u2019t need to buy right now. And then when you begin to look at all the other extraneous factors that will impact their decisions from glyphosate pricing dropping and then looking at how that impacts, etcetera. And quite honestly, the retailers are really trying to manage their cash flow. And so they are looking at things as well to make sure that they are empty by the end of the season. And so with all that, you get delayed buying pattern that really is more normal. And so when we say normalized, you begin to look at prior years before \u201822 and you begin to see that we\u2019re just basically saying that ordering will become more like it has been in the past. Operator : And moving on to David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Chuck, commodity prices have been dropping a little bit here. At what point is that concern for you and your longer-term earnings guidance? I know it\u2019s still well above long-term rates, but they have dropped a little bit here. Thank you. Chuck Magro : Good morning, David. So look, if you step back and you think through the last 2 years in terms of crop pricing, we\u2019ve seen very strong crop pricing and one was a record, right? So that is where we are coming off of. But when you look at 2023, we\u2019re still well above mid-cycle. And crop pricing is still above historical averages. There is still a very tight stocks-to-use ratio out there. And then if you look at the growing markets, the major growing and exporting markets around the world, you\u2019ve got Argentina that is under a 60-year drought. It\u2019s the worst in 60 years. You\u2019ve got the Ukraine still under significant conflict and not able to produce corn the way they want to. The drought in Southern Brazil looks like it\u2019s turned the corner. So we\u2019re going to see, I think, good production out of Brazil. But in our view, it\u2019s going to come down to the U.S. and the planning in the United States. And it\u2019s too early to talk about that crop right now because it\u2019s just going in the ground. But we also believe when we look at the stocks-to-use models that we need 2 consecutive years at trend yield. And this year may or may not be. So look, we\u2019re still very optimistic about where we are in the cycle. Now when you talk about Corteva and the influence of the cycle on Corteva, that\u2019s a bit of a different question. In fact, if you look at the way we frame the value creation opportunity for 2025, $4.4 billion, $20 billion of revenue, in 21% to 23% margins. A lot of the value creation levers are well within our control. And of course, we\u2019re operating in the ag market. But when you talk about royalty neutrality of the journey, when you talk about the product mix and really optimizing the percentage of differentiated products that we put into the market, when you talk about the number of new products that are going to go in the market in the next couple of years, all of these things, I think, are well within our control, and they are the major levers of value creation. So I think there is 2 points to make today. One is we\u2019re very comfortable with where we are in the cycle. In fact, we think that 2023 is going to be a very, very good year for agriculture. And then on top of that, when you think through our value creation levers, a lot of that will be within our control and it\u2019s a matter of execution. And as the team has been saying today, we feel very good where we are today. And the first quarter is a bit of a testimony of that is the significant amount of new product sales we put into the market. It was the first time we hit 25% EBITDA margin in the first quarter. So we like the strategic levers we\u2019re pulling, and we think they are adding value. Operator : And our next question will come from Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho. Christopher Parkinson : Great. Thank you so much. So when you look at your \u2013 the first quarter EBITDA bridge, I mean it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re pricing well above cost, which is positive. But could you just give a little bit further insight on how we should be thinking about that by segment just for the balance of the year and the cadence and how that evolves throughout the balance of \u201823? Thank you so much. Chuck Magro : Go ahead, David. Dave Anderson : Maybe I can take that one. So when you look at the first quarter and \u2013 sorry, there we go. When you look at the first quarter, of course, the pricing, as we talked about, was influenced also by EMEA. And just maybe just chat a little bit about that just to give you some perspective. As we mentioned, Chris, in the call that we had fairly significant currency headwinds in EMEA in quarter one. And in fact, if you exclude euro-based currencies, the headwind was only 1%. So it really gives you kind of an indication of how significant it was. So given that fact, that really also influenced our pricing. So in other words, it wasn\u2019t just the price for value and against cost, it was also against the currency headwinds that we faced. So that\u2019s important. As we\u2019ve indicated, our pricing remains on track for the full year against our original guide that we made for pricing. And the numbers are significantly consistent whether you look at the seed business where we expect high single-digit pricing for the full year or crop protection, where we expect low to mid-single-digit pricing for the full year for crop. So no change from that. And again, first quarter very much influenced by that EMEA phenomenon that I mentioned to you. Operator : And we have a question from Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Sort of a two-part question. Is your mix in corn seeds in North America improving and making an appreciable difference to your corn economics? And second, in terms of cash flows, the cash flows year-over-year were lower by $600 million. And a big piece of that was accounts payable and that accounts payable sequentially went up, I don\u2019t know, $950 million and normally, decreased $950 million. And normally, it decreases maybe $400 million? What\u2019s going on with payables? Will your payables be higher in 2023 than in \u201822? How does that line work? What\u2019s going on there? Dave Anderson : Yes. Do you want me to maybe take the cash first, Tim, and then you can come back and talk about seed North America. So Jeff, good morning, this is Dave. So, you are right, the cash flow was $3.5 billion use of cash in the first quarter compared to $2.9 billion in Q1 of 2022. As you know, that was really related to, you would expect significant related to receivables balances with the growth that we had. And we also had relatively neutral contribution from inventories in the quarter on a period-over-period basis. The payables is really timing related. It\u2019s a good call out. We expect that to normalize over the course of the year. There is a number of factors that influence that. We can explain a little more of that detail if it makes sense offline. But just to know that, number one, it\u2019s a good callout. And number two, we do expect that to normalize over the course of 2023. And by the way, the cash forecast that we had for the quarter were basically slightly ahead of our own internal plans. So, the numbers that you are looking at are consistent with what our own expectation was and consistent with what the guide is that we have updated today for cash flow for the year. Tim? Tim Glenn : Hey Jeff. On the second \u2013 or the first question, I guess on the mix, if we are seeing an improving mix in corn technology, what I would say is when you look over the course of the season, our technology mix doesn\u2019t vary that much on a year-to-year basis. Farmers get comfortable with certain types of technology. It\u2019s critical for their operation. They kind of plan accordingly for that. And in terms of the year-to-year shift, you might have a point or 2 points shift, but it tends to be very consistent. I think what you are seeing in terms of first quarter versus first half is we had a little bit different mix in terms of the out-the-door sales. And so we probably had a lower representation of the Pioneer in the sales rep model and more dealer distributor, which will be primarily Brevant into retail as well as in the South and Southeast where Pioneer is going through distribution as well. So, probably saw more of a mix effect on the quarter in terms of channel versus technology. And again, our technology they don\u2019t change that much. I would just emphasize, we had a kind of a miserable end of March and beginning of April. So, that\u2019s why we ended up with a higher percentage of \u2013 from a weather standpoint, from a higher percentage of, call it, dealer distributor business and to farmers through our agents. So \u2013 but the technology mix doesn\u2019t change on a year-to-year basis so much. Operator : And our next question will come from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. I would like to better understand what you mean by the shortened safrinha season, or perhaps you can break down that 41% decline in seed volume? Conab has safrinha corn area modestly up year-over-year. So, I don\u2019t quite understand it. Perhaps it was a pull forward from the fourth quarter and/or how much of it was due to just insufficient seed supply? Tim Glenn : Hey Steve. Good morning. This is Tim. I will take this. So, there are a couple of things happening in terms of seed in Brazil and we knew we were going to be tight on supply. And as you called out there, and we have been talking about that, I think for probably the last couple of quarters, we had low inventory, challenging production seasons. And so we knew we were very tight in terms of what our supply would be for the entire safrinha season. And what happened was the dynamic played out as soybean harvest continued. It expanded into some of the smaller states. And so Montegrosso, which is about half of Safrina was planted on a relatively timely basis. But when you get into Sao Paulo and then [indiscernible] and Paran\u00e1 was much more delayed. And so in the end, there were fewer hectares planted. And you are right, Conab is showing about 3% increase, we had planned and expected for it to be more like 10%. So, that\u2019s where we talk about the season being shortened. And in terms of the timing, what was fourth quarter a little bit bigger, it was, and part of that was because farmers knew we were going to be tight on supply, and they physically wanted to have that seed and so there was a pull from our farmer customers to get that seed in their hand. When you look at it on a seasonal basis, so with the \u2013 let\u2019s assume the 3% area increase, take our volume in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, we are actually about flat on volume. So \u2013 and that includes very strong price increases as you have seen right there. So, didn\u2019t play out exactly as we expected it to, but we are very close to holding share in a market where we knew we were tight on supply, and we were very strong on value capture. And as we go forward, so I will touch on the whole question around supply just so we can do it, kind of close the door on that. We did take a different approach in terms of focusing much more on summer production and we are much less dependent upon just-in-time or safrinha seed production. So, just like farmers have summer season and safrinha season, we produce over both. We increased the mix of production more towards the summer season. As we sit here today, a significant portion of the seed that we are going to use for the upcoming summer and safrinha seasons has either been harvested or it\u2019s very close to being harvested. So, we are in a materially better position to meet the needs of the market based on the growth trajectory. And as we look at next year, we expect that Brazil will continue to increase both soybean area and safrinha area and that we are going to be in a good position to meet the needs. Operator : And we have a question from Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer. Kristen Owen : Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what you are seeing on the ground in terms of the flooding in Iowa? Just any impact to planting season, or just how we should think about maybe the puts and takes, positives or negatives that may come from that event as you see it throughout the rest of the year? Thank you. Tim Glenn : I think that\u2019s heading my way again, Kristen. Good morning. So, in terms of the state of the season, I describe overall, we are off to a decent start with planning progress. And we are at \u2013 on corn, we are at about the 5-year average as of Monday when the USDA last reported, and we are slightly ahead of the 5-year average on soybeans. And so again, it\u2019s despite getting off to a really pretty slow start at the beginning of April as we were working through the end of winter and really moving towards spring conditions. Across the corn belt, all indications are that we are going to continue to get the crop in the ground on a timely basis. So, we do have some isolated places where we have had some river flooding due to the snow melt. And you pointed out Northeast Iowa is one of those areas. Another area that we are looking really closely at is the Northern Plains or the Red River Valley. Tuesday afternoon, I had a conversation with our area leader there to understand where we were sitting and actually a tremendous amount of progress has been made up there, and we are very optimistic that farmers are going to be able to get most or nearly all this crop in the ground. So, the thing we got to remember is that we have large farmer customers, and they are highly motivated to get the crop in the ground. So, we have got about 30 days of good corn planting window here, call it, the month of May in front of us. And as the season opens in those areas, farmers are going to be able to move fast, and they are very motivated to get that corn in the ground. So, we will continue to watch it. But as of right now, I would not put up a red flag on that. Operator : And we have a question from Arun Viswanathan with RBC. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Your results look [Technical Difficulty] you thought and seen from maybe some of your peers. Was that \u2013 would you attribute that to maybe share gains in crop protection and new product rollouts, or how would you kind of consider your performance versus the global ag market trends? Have you seen any changes in ag markets, or is it just more internal? Thanks. Chuck Magro : Yes. I can have Robert and Tim talk about where they think they stand from a share perspective. But \u2013 at the highest level, look, we have been on this strategic journey now for a couple of years, where we are trying to really drive the portfolio through some choices around which countries we operate in and what our product slates look like and really drive the differentiation of new technology around the world. And so we have made a series of decisions. I think we have been prudent with our SG&A. Dave referenced that essentially flat for the last couple of years on an apples-to-apples basis and really trying to focus on our controllables. So \u2013 and then, of course we do have just a very strong lineup from an R&D pipeline perspective. Some of those new products now are coming into the marketplace, both in seed and in CP. And I think that is allowing us to drive market acceptance of these products and allow volume growth. So Robert, maybe talk a little bit about what you are seeing and then Tim can do the same. Robert King : Yes. Thanks Chuck. On the CP side, let me start with \u2013 we continue to see the market will grow on a year-over-year basis even in \u201823, where we expecting from the non-glyphosate \u2013 take glyphosate out, about 6% to 8% or mid-single digits really is really the better normal or the better number. For our growth on total market, when you begin to look then at how we performed from a market standpoint, 2022, the organic growth for the industry was in the mid-teens. And we grew, as you saw in the Q4 report, about 20% on organic growth. So, we expect we picked up a few points of market share around the globe. Obviously, all the numbers aren\u2019t totally in, so we got to see how things settle out. But we do expect that we have gained a little bit over the last year. And as you begin to project that forward into this year and what\u2019s happening, the volume is growing from crop protection around the world and for us as well. The shift that I talked about earlier is just timing. And so the demand remains very strong as we see it. And for us, it\u2019s really centered around the differentiation and the strategy that we put in place to be differentiated and sustainably advantaged in our portfolio, and that\u2019s really being driven by two areas primarily. New product growth as you saw in first quarter was up, and we expect that we will be up across the year from new products. And Spinosyns, Spinosyns continue to be a franchise of over $1 billion this year, and it is continuing to grow. So, when you begin to look at how we are different in the market, we are continuing to be able to deliver new technologies to the growers that really helped them add value and yield to their farms. So, those are some of the things that\u2019s driving us, how we see the numbers a little bit there across the last year and the first quarter. Tim Glenn : Yes. Arun, on the seed side, obviously, it\u2019s too early to call 2023 on a market share standpoint. We felt good about how our order position has sat for both corn and soybeans in North America and Europe as the season has gone on. So, we will kind of wait and see how the season developed, but we feel pretty decent about where we are sitting right there. In terms of how we performed over the past several seasons, much like Robert said, we carry a lot of momentum in the marketplace right now. And on the seed side, we have been growing \u2013 holding our growing market share for the last several seasons in many of the largest markets out there. So, North America corn and soy, last year, we gained about a point each, which is significant. We have had multiple years of share growth in Europe on corn and sunflowers. And up until this past safrinha season, we have been on a very positive share track across Brazil as well. So, when we think about unit volume as important because it is the metric that\u2019s key in the marketplace. We also look at the value share out there as well. And I think when you look at the combination of strong unit growth as well as the pricing we have been able to deliver over the past several seasons as well, we are also gaining on that value side as well. So, feel very comfortable about where we are at and something that we do watch as a key metric for our business. Operator : And our next question will come from Joshua Spector with Lukas with UBS. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good morning. This is Lukas [ph] on for Josh. Just wanted to clarify the earlier comments on the EBITDA phasing. So, were you implying that the second quarter would be sort of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion based on 80% in the first half? And if that\u2019s right, then your guide sort of implying $700 million to $800 million in the second half, so could you help us bridge there sort of how you get from the $465 million in the second half last year to $700 million to $800 million this year, please? Dave Anderson : Yes. This is Dave. I can give you a little bit of additional color on that. So again, it\u2019s against the backdrop of the EBITDA guide, as you decided that we have given for the full year, call it, $3.65 billion at the midpoint. When you look at the pattern for this year, we would expect revenues to be slightly different, but roughly in line with last year. So, roughly 60% first half, 40% second half. On the other hand, on the \u2013 in the EBITDA, as I have said, if you look at last year, we had about 85%, a little over 85% of our EBITDA that was generated last year was generated in the first half. We are going to be some 300 basis points to 400 basis points likely less than that in terms of 1H 2023 EBITDA as a percent of the total year compared to 2022. So, when you do that, and back into math, what you get is you still have growth, obviously, in the second quarter, but it\u2019s more muted for the reasons that we talked about, the timing of EMEA and the shift out of LatAm mostly from 1H last year or more significantly 1H last year into a more normalized pattern of 1H, 2H for this year. So, that\u2019s really the difference. And again, that earnings, when you look at that distribution, it\u2019s not that much different than we have had pre-2022 levels. So, hopefully that helps. Operator : And we have a question from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Ben Theurer : Good morning and thank you very much. Congrats on the result. I wanted to follow-up just a little bit on the short and medium-term impact as to your guidance and some of the strategic announcements you have made. So, how should we think about the portfolio execution on these exits and how is that going to shape? Is that all baked in into the guidance for this year, what are the main impacts and where do you see maybe potential to increase further to get closer, call it to the higher end of the range in the long run versus the lower end of the range? What are like kind of the levers we should consider here? Thank you. Chuck Magro : Dave, do you want to take that one? Dave Anderson : Yes. I think one of the things we have been saying, Chuck referenced this earlier is, we are well on path in terms of the product exits, the AIs, if you will, the active ingredients, exit as well as some of the geographies that we are exiting. So, the majority of that is going to be completed over the course of 2023, and that\u2019s baked into our guidance. Now importantly, when you look at the numbers in terms of the significance of those exits, it really does have a big impact on the figures. So, for example, when you look at total Corteva for the full year, and now I am talking just specifically about volume, when you look at the full year on an adjusted basis, what we are going to see is positive growth of over 3% for total Corteva. It\u2019s really significant when you look at the crop protection business, on the significance of exits because when you include both the impact of product exits and also the decision to exit Russia, which as you know, we announced in 2022. I mentioned for the first quarter that crop protection volume would actually be up. And for the full year, it\u2019s going to be up attractively mid-single digits when you adjust for those strategic decisions. So, I think a couple of takeaways. I think number one, relative to your question, we are absolutely on track. It\u2019s built into our numbers. You are seeing that, as Chuck said, in terms of the quality of earnings, you seeing that in terms of the margin lift that we are generating and the guide that we have given you for the full year. And second, the optics are fairly significant when you look at the volume numbers. So, when you adjust for those exits. The numbers are, as we have said, are pretty attractive and continue to contribute to our strong organic growth outlook that we have shared with you today. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to Kim Booth for any additional or closing remarks. Kim Booth : Okay. Thank you. And that concludes today\u2019s call. We thank you for joining and for your interest in Corteva. We hope you have a safe and wonderful day. Operator : Well, thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day.",

At this time, I'd now like to turn the conference over to Kim Booth. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kim Booth : Good morning and welcome to Corteva's second quarter and first half 2023 earnings conference call. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Chuck Magro, Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Anderson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Tim Glenn, Executive Vice President, Seed Business Unit; and Robert King, Executive Vice President, Crop Protection Business Unit, will join the Q&A session. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks during this call posted on the Investor Relations section of the Corteva website and through the link to our webcast. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements which are our expectations about the future. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could materially differ from these statements due to these risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, those discussed on this call and in the Risk Factors section of our reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please note in today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release and related schedules, along with our supplemental financial summary slide deck available on our Investor Relations website. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Magro : Thanks, Kim. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. In the first half of 2023, Corteva continued to deliver top and bottom-line growth with over 180 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion driven by strong demand for Corteva's proprietary technology. This is translating to another year of anticipated growth and significant margin improvement as we remain on track to deliver the 2025 financial targets we laid out at Investor Day last September. Seed continues what can only be called a terrific performance in the first half of the year, with about 240 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion and double-digit organic sales gains in corn. North America is benefiting from higher corn acres and pricing actions, both of which offset higher input costs. Our market share in Seed remains strong. In the U.S., the first half of the year saw double-digit revenue growth in Pioneer and Brevant as customers recognize the value our products provide. We are pleased to see Enlist E3 recognized by the market. This year, Enlist E3 is the number one selling soybean technology in the U.S. and we expect E3 beans to be on at least 55% of U.S. soybean acres in 2023. Further strengthening our portfolio, we launched PowerCore Enlist Advanced RA for corn, providing farmers with the added flexibility of [indiscernible] along with advanced combination of aboveground insect control, herbicide tolerance and industry-leading genetics available to farmers in 2024, this enhances the strong technology position for our leading seed brands as well as creates new out-licensing opportunities. In Crop Protection, farmers continue to invest in products to enhance and protect crop yields. However, customers are adjusting their purchasing patterns to reflect the macroeconomic environment. A combination of factors from interest rates to supply availability, to working capital management, is motivating buyers, including retailers and distributors to adjust the timing of their purchases to be closer to their intended use. We see these actions as a result of supply chain rebalancing and believe they could persist at least through the end of 2023. Our Crop Protection business remains resilient by focusing on levers within our control. The team is delivering on our strategy, including pricing for our new and differentiated technologies as well as executing on portfolio and productivity actions. We have made excellent progress on building our Biologicals business, including the integration of our recent acquisitions which are on track to deliver $90 million of EBITDA in 2023. And we continue to advance our pipeline of new AIs with the expected global launch of Reklemel Active later this year, pending regulatory approval. This is a first of its kind selective nematocide that targets harmful organisms while not impacting beneficial organisms in the soil. This reflects the continued journey of introducing new sustainable differentiated tools to the farmer. Agriculture fundamentals remain positive. Our products continue to be in high demand and we are laser-focused on executing our strategy and becoming more efficient. At the same time, to reflect the current industry environment, we are adjusting our full year net sales guidance down by about 4% versus the midpoint of what we guided last quarter driven by muted sales growth in Crop Protection as the channel destocks. We are also modestly reducing the midpoint of our 2023 EBITDA guidance, reflecting the revenue reduction partially offset by strength of product mix, royalty reductions and cost actions. Now, let's turn to the market outlook. Recent USDA estimates have yields in the U.S. to be below trend line for the third year in a row, even with below trend yields, given forecasted production in the U.S. and Brazil, ending stocks are expected to build which may put pressure on prices. Commodity prices for the 2023 crop are expected to be down from recent highs but still remain above historical averages. The continued impact of Russia's war on Ukraine along with projected record demand for grains and oilseeds for food, feed and biofuels are currently expected to keep prices at profitable levels. The demand for biofuels hit a record in 2023 with the expectation this will grow again in 2024. At the end of the day, the world needs to produce more crops with less land and a reduced environmental impact. This, we believe, is a recipe for our top-tier C genetics and differentiated crop protection technology solutions. We're seeing strong demand for Biologicals and Biofuels and we're investing in those areas. Therefore, our overall view is that we will continue to see favorable farm income and demand for inputs. In this environment, farmers are more incentivized to increase and protect their yields. Following a record year in 2022, 2023 is estimated to be in the top 5 on record for U.S. farm net income, allowing farmers, particularly in the Americas, to expand planted acres and also invest in proven technology to safeguard their profitability. Now, let's take a look at the Crop Protection market in more detail. When we spoke to you in early May, we highlighted a change in buying patterns, driven by improvements in supply chain reliability as well as higher interest rates, particularly in Latin America, where we were expecting order patterns in the second half of '23 to look closer to pre-'22. We also noted 2 weather-driven hotspots of elevated channel inventories, fungicides in Latin America due to drought and insecticides in Asia Pacific due to wet conditions. What became clear in the latter part of the second quarter is the combination of events that has caused orders to shift to a more just-in-time approach. This focus on inventory levels has resulted in a pullback in orders late in the second quarter which was most pronounced in Latin America, followed by North America. Order books are closer to where we'd expect them to be in Brazil at this time of year based on historical patterns. We've included in our updated guidance, the push out of Latin America volume to the second half and continued destocking in North America. Against this backdrop, farmers continue to invest in top-tier technology to drive productivity at the farm. For Corteva's perspective, we believe our renewed focus on differentiated and sustainable solutions makes us more efficient and better able to lead through these dynamic market conditions. The strategic and operational decisions we made last year have allowed us to get ahead of the crop protection industry-wide channel destocking and sets us apart from our peers. We continue to advance our strategy by strengthening our portfolio and investing in R&D to drive strong, sustainable growth. Our first half performance and continued demand for our differentiated technology provides confidence in our 2025 targets with clear value creation levers largely within our control. And now, let me turn the call over to Dave. Dave Anderson : Thanks, Chuck and welcome, everyone, to the call. Let's start on Slide 7 which provides the financial results for the quarter and half. As Chuck said and you can see from the numbers, we had a solid first half against quickly evolving market conditions. Briefly touching on the quarter, organic sales were down 4% compared to prior year with pricing gains in both segments more than offset by declines in volume and Crop Protection. Volumes were impacted by strategic portfolio actions and the exit from Russia which combined represent an approximate $240 million headwind in the quarter. In addition, we saw delayed customer purchases due to weather, higher interest rates and supply availability, again, particularly in Latin America and North America. Despite the reduction in top line growth, improved product mix and ongoing productivity and cost actions translated to earnings growth of 2% and nearly 140 basis points of margin expansion. Now focusing on the half. Organic sales grew 2%, with broad-based pricing gains. Global pricing was up 11% with strong execution in both Seed and Crop Protection. Seed volumes were down 5% versus prior year, largely driven by the decision to exit Russia with Crop Protection volumes down 16% which includes a 5% headwind from strategic portfolio exits. The top line performance translated into operating EBITDA of nearly $3 billion for the half, an increase of 8%. Pricing, favorable product mix and productivity more than offset higher input costs and volume and currency headwinds, driving more than 180 basis points of margin expansion. So let's go to Slide 8, where you can see how the performance of our Seed business offset the Crop Protection market headwinds in the first half for total company sales growth of 1% compared to prior year. Seed net sales were up 8% in the first 6 months to more than $6.9 billion. Organic sales were up 9% on strong price execution as we continue the price for value strategy and also offset higher input costs. Global seed price was up 14% for the half with pricing gains in every region, led by North America and EMEA. Seed volumes were down 5% versus prior year. Gains in North America driven by increased corn acres more than offset fewer soybean acres. Volume declines in EMEA were driven by the exit from Russia and lower corn planted area, with Latin America and Asia Pacific volumes down due to delayed plannings and also seasonal timing shifts. And importantly, the exit from Russia represented a 3% headwind for the Seed segment. Crop Protection net sales were down 9% compared to prior year to more than $3.9 billion. Organic sales were down 9% for the half with pricing gains more than offset by lower volume. Global Crop Protection pricing was up 7% for the half versus prior year, reflecting pricing for value of our differentiated technology as well as to offset higher raw materials globally as well as currency impacts in EMEA. Crop Protection volumes were down 16% for the first half, impacted by the shift in order patterns that Chuck referenced as well as the roughly $240 million headwind from the strategic portfolio actions and exit from Russia. Currency headwind on both Seed and Crop Protection was 3%, largely driven by European currencies. And finally, the Biologicals acquisitions added $135 million of revenue since we closed on the deals in early March which is reflected in portfolio and other. Taking a step back, the performance in the first half showcases the strength and complementary nature of our diverse portfolio. With that, let's go to Slide 9, for a summary of the first half operating EBITDA. You can see the operating EBITDA increased approximately $220 million to just under $3 billion, pricing and product mix, coupled with productivity and cost actions more than offset declines in volume and higher cost in currency headwinds. And we took a significant step in the journey towards royalty neutrality with more than $150 million of combined benefit from increased royalty income and a decrease in royalty expense driven by the continued penetration of Enlist. The nearly $450 million of net cost headwind was related to seed commodity costs and unfavorable yield impact as well as crop protection inflation. Crop Protection raw material costs were up about 5% versus the prior year as we sold through higher cost inventory. In total, market-driven cost headwinds and other costs were mitigated by the improvement in net royalty expense and $175 million of productivity savings. SG&A spend in the first half of the year was about flat versus prior year. It reflects the inclusion of approximately $50 million in SG&A from the Biologicals acquisitions. So excluding the acquisitions, SG&A is down versus prior year as we maintain disciplined spending and execution on cost actions. Investment in R&D was up roughly $80 million for the half, aligned with the targeted spend increases to support our leading position in ag technology. Portfolio and other gains in the half were driven by the Biologicals acquisitions which contributed $22 million of EBITDA. Currency was a $228 million headwind, again, driven primarily by European currencies. Turning now to Slide 10. I want to take you through Crop [ph] Protection segment. We now expect net sales to be in the range of $17.9 billion to $18.2 billion or 3% growth at the midpoint, roughly $700 million lower than the previous guide. This is largely driven by North America and Latin America Crop Protection. And consistent with the prior guide, we expect approximately $450 million of net sales for the full year from the Biologicals acquisitions. Operating EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.65 billion, 11% growth versus the prior year at the midpoint. The updated guidance is driven by lower top line growth, partially offset by improved product mix and greater-than-expected benefits from reduced net royalty expense as well as productivity and cost actions. Importantly, with the strength of Seed performance in the first half and Crop Protection's improved product mix, we now expect operating EBITDA margin of 19.8% at the midpoint of guidance or more than 130 basis points of margin expansion over prior year with growth in both Seed and Crop Protection. Operating EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.90 per share, an increase of 6% versus the prior year at the midpoint. The change in guidance reflects lower earnings partially offset by lower forecasted effective tax rate and also a lower share count. Now it's important to point out that the allocation of earnings between the third and fourth quarters. Again, we expect order patterns to be more consistent with historical timing. This timing in Latin America sales, coupled with the seasonal patterns of the Biologicals acquisitions, is expected to result in nearly all of our second half earnings to be delivered in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow is now forecasted to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. We expect share repurchases to be approximately $500 million for the year, including $330 million that we completed in the first half. And of course, we recently announced a 7% increase in the dividend consistent with the dividend growth strategy. On Slide 11, I want to remind you, importantly, of the value creation framework we introduced at last year's Investor Day to accelerate our performance and deliver greater value to shareholders. The 2025 financial targets we presented included operating EBITDA of $4.4 billion or a 22% margin at the midpoint. This slide includes those 2025 financial performance targets and it also reflects today's guidance for 2023. Execution on our strategic decisions including exiting low-margin commodity products, while delivering a cumulative $250 million reduction in net royalty expense and disciplined cost actions is driving margin expansion while also enabling increased R&D investment. And while we're revising our 2023 revenue and EBITDA guidance, we're confident that we're on track to deliver the 2025 earnings targets. With that, let's go to Slide 12 and summarize the key takeaways. Again, we believe ag fundamentals remain positive and demand at the farm level is stable despite the significant Crop Protection market pullback that we're experiencing. We believe Corteva is well positioned relative to the market despite the industry-wide destocking trends and some macro level headwinds and our revised full year guide is proof of the strength of our portfolio with continued sales and earnings growth in 2023. We believe this performance differentiates us from others in the industry. And finally, our expected 2023 performance supports our 2025 financial targets and provides us confidence that we're able to execute and grow. And with that, let me turn it over to Kim. Kim Booth : Thanks, Dave. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : With the new '23 guidance and the reiteration of the '25 targets and obviously, the complexity of the crop chemical market right now, could you help bridge us through '24 to '25? In other words, what's changed about the algorithm or the growth by segment on the top line, it's still going to let you get into that zone? Or is it more likely that you're going to just be at the lower end of that '25 revenue target now and make up the EBITDA, maybe with more productivity? Or sort of what's changed today versus, I guess, a little less than a year ago in the algorithm between '23 and '25? Chuck Magro : Vincent, yes, so let me give you a couple of thoughts and then I'll turn it over to Dave to talk a bit about the specifics. So -- look, we don't think a whole lot has changed. If you think about what's happened with the channel and the industry-wide destocking, obviously, it came up -- it was a larger issue and it happened a lot faster than anyone expected. But we do think that this situation is temporary and it's certainly not sustainable. So when we start thinking about the plans for 2024 and then to your question, 2025, we do think that we're on the same trajectory that we were when we laid this out back in September. And if you start thinking about what we have to deliver, as we've communicated a couple of times now before, a lot of this journey is well within our own control. And so what we're trying to do is reshape the overall strategy and the portfolio of the company. So what we're going to need to do in '24 and '25 is some of the same things that we've been working on for the last 2 years. So we are expecting, for example, our [indiscernible] and our new products in CP to continue to grow. They actually held up pretty well in 2023 so far and we're expecting growth through the rest of the year. We're about 80% complete through the product and country exits by the end of this year. So we'll finish those in the next 2 years. We did indicate in this morning's call already that our royalty expenses are running a little lower than we had expected. So we had previously thought about $100 million of expense reduction, we're closer to $150 million now and well on track for the $250 million by 2025. I think some of the other things that we're seeing and it's a little too early to talk about the specifics. We are expecting some lower costs now to flow through the P&L. I'd say both in Seed and CP through 2024 and certainly through 2025, it's too early to give specifics but that's sort of how we're thinking about things. There's going to be some offset because we are planning to continue to invest in R&D. We're targeting 8% of revenue. So when you put all of this together, I don't think we should talk about the low end or the top end. We feel very comfortable that we're basically on the same path in that this channel destocking issue that's happening right now I think we'll be behind -- a significant portion of it will be behind us this year. There could be pockets that move into next year. But certainly, the framework we've laid out, I think, is still one that we're very confident in. Dave, anything to add? Dave Anderson : Just a couple -- I think maybe just a couple of quick points, Vincent. I think, first of all, as Chuck said, what we're seeing is very good performance, obviously, on margin -- on EBITDA and margin despite the volume headwind that we're experiencing the Crop Protection business this year. So it's a real tribute obviously, to our cost performance and cost management but also the shifts that have taken place related to our portfolio refinements and the upgrade, if you will, the strengthening in the quality of the businesses, the technology delivery and seed and the enhanced differentiation and technology in the Crop Protection business. So it's really, I think, that formula, that's working. And if anything, it's working faster in terms of that margin rate and the EBITDA delivery despite the volume, again, despite the volume headwind. So we'll obviously be updating all of this. It's -- the March will proceed now forward to 2024. And it won't be long before we'll be talking with you about our guide for 2024. But what we see right now, as Chuck said, is continued positive setup in terms of the overall fundamentals we're going to work through, obviously, as an industry, this destocking issue and this phenomenon in terms of inventory correction, particularly in the channel in 2023. That's going to work its way through. It's going to take time. But our outlook right now remains quite constructive, quite positive when we look forward with, again, an acceleration of what we've seen in terms of our cost performance and our margin performance. Hopefully, that helps. Operator : Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Chuck, on the Crop Protection destocking, can you talk to the cadence of the destocking in May, June and July and what you're now expecting or seeing in August? Are we close to -- or pass the peak of the destocking, do you think? Chuck Magro : David. So look, this came up on the industry pretty quickly. It sort of became very clear that how we were thinking about it in terms of pockets. If you recall at the end of the last quarter, we were talking that we knew there were pockets of higher inventories, some areas of LatAm and Asia Pacific really weather-driven. By the end of May, it became very clear that what we were talking about was more systemic and broad-based. And at that point, what we're seeing, so just to set the stage, right? The one thing that this industry has is it has pretty good line of sight for data that goes into the channel and that leaves the channel. And what we're seeing is that on-farm demand actually very, I'd say, positive. And it's been consistent over the last 2 to 3 years at a low single-digit growth when you're talking about organic revenue. So that's the good news is we -- and you can imagine, since May, we have spent a lot of time looking at this but we're feeling very good that the overall fundamentals, farmers health and they're applying the products they need to preserve their crop and to drive yield. But what happened since the end of May is that there has been a very significant pullback by the channel because they've had too much inventory. And so what we're expecting now is that by the time we get through the end of this year, that -- I'd say most of it will be behind us. But that doesn't mean that we're out of the woods when it comes to 2024. There's probably going to be some product lines and some geographies that this will persist into 2024 and we're planning for that. We understand that. We're going to work with our channel partners. But overall, I think what we're also finding is that it wasn't just an inventory perspective. But with the higher cost of capital, higher interest rates specifically, there is a move clearly back to the way the industry operated pre-2022, right? Where the industry really was used, especially in North America but also I'd say in Latin America, where these supply chains are quite sophisticated. They have high fidelity and the channel plus, the farming community got very comfortable that the product can be delivered just in time. So we're going to see that. So unfortunately, what will happen is you're going to see that in the seasonality, especially around Q3, that's why Dave communicated sort of the earnings split between Q3 and Q4. But I wouldn't say that we're not constructive about 2024. The 2024 setup still looks to us to be pretty good. You've got record demand for grains and oilseeds. You have record demand for biofuels in '23. We think there'll be another record in '24. As we talked about, crop prices have come down but farmer margins are still really healthy and we haven't seen a change in buying behavior in terms of the products that they're investing in. But would there be -- is it possible that there's going to be some carryover in terms of the destocking in 2024? Certainly in the first part of '24, that's entirely possible. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Just to peel the onion a little bit more on the Crop Protection destocking. As you survey the world, do you think there's more excess at the distributor level or the end user grower level or both? And I guess maybe a related question. Can you speak to the 3Q, 4Q earnings cadence? I think you made a comment that earnings would be mainly in the fourth quarter. Obviously, you have a lot of seasonal effects even in a normal year but just kind of wondering how the destock will affect that in terms of your current planning view. Chuck Magro : Kevin, let me take the question on where the inventory is or our belief and then Dave, you can cover the Q3, Q4 split, please? Look, this is, I'd say, mostly an issue in the channel. So the distributor in the retail channel is where the surplus inventory is and where it needs to move to the farm. It depends on where you're talking around from on-farm storage but I would say, broadly speaking, there isn't -- it's a lot of on-farm storage in our major markets. If you look at the [indiscernible], so there would not be typically a lot of on-farm storage. So we believe that this is clearly an inventory issue in the channel. Could there be some leftover or totes [ph] on the farm? Yes, absolutely. But I think if you step back and you think about how did we get here, right? I think what clearly happened is when the supply chain issues were front and center, I think the channel ordered more than they needed just to ensure reliability of supply. And farmers typically wouldn't take that product. So we're pretty confident that we know where it is. And it is moving out. I think there's been a lot of progress made in the last few months. We can see it in the data. And so we're optimistic that this is heading in the right direction. Dave, you want to talk about Q3 and Q4? Dave Anderson : Sure, sure. And maybe the way I could start that, Kevin, start the conversation in Q3 and Q4. So maybe just talk a little bit about the half -- sort of what's implied in terms of guide for the half, just to give you some perspective. So to the midpoint of our revenue guide, the $18.5 billion [ph], that would imply a revenue increase on a year-over-year basis of $500 million. Now importantly, when you look at that, it includes our Biological acquisitions. So there's about $300 million of that $500 million that's coming about as a result of the acquisitions. On the EBITDA, what's implied, our actual last year for the second half was $466 million. This year [indiscernible] numbers, it's about $600 million. And again, very importantly, the Biologicals acquisition represents about $70 million. If you look at that $90 million number that we've given you is a full year guide for Biologicals contribution to EBITDA, $20 million in the first half, $70 million in the second half. So keep that in mind just in terms of giving some perspective on kind of what's assumed here, if you will, in the growth that's assumed for the second half. Now to your question in terms of 3Q, 4Q, it really has to do with timing of LatAm and timing associated with the acquisition contributions. The acquisition contributions are really mostly now in terms of second half will be in the fourth quarter, specifically the Stoller [ph] acquisition and its business which is really for the second half, really focused on Brazil. And then for LatAm, in total, when you look at our -- both our Seed business, Seed business with a normal distribution 3Q to 4Q and then for Robert's Crop Protection business, you're really looking at, again, that recalibration from 1H to 2H from the first half to the second half that we communicated back in May, that's playing out. We've got more insights on that now and that really is the other reason the other big component of the fourth quarter and the significance of the fourth quarter. If you look at it historically, it's not atypical compared to when you go back to '21 -- 2020 [ph], it is different than 2022 but 2022 really was anomalous in terms of the distribution, particularly the distribution pattern that we experienced in Latin America. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Parkinson from Mizuho. Christopher Parkinson : Great. As we're all beginning to think about 2024 as well as a few variables which you perhaps have better line of sight on or, in some cases, or directly in your control. Can you just hit on a few of those -- when we're thinking about net royalty reductions, E3 penetration, how we're thinking about [indiscernible] costs based on the presumably lower payments to certified growers, CPC inputs looks like they're easing a little bit. So when we're taking ourselves outside of just the price volume side of it, can you just kind of give us some initial thought processes on how we should be approaching that once again, considering 2024? Chuck Magro : Yes. Chris, so look, lots of time to talk about 2024. We haven't really started our detailed planning sessions yet. But the way we're thinking about it, just to give you sort of the directional thoughts. First, the ag setup looks pretty constructive as I've mentioned. We still think that we're going to have above average historical pricing. Obviously, with the size of the crop in Brazil right now, we're going to have some rebalancing of stocks but still, I think, relative tight market conditions. We've got healthy farmers around the world. They just come off 2 record years. This year won't be a record but it's still going to be at least in the U.S., we think a top 5 year. So the setup is very constructive. And then as I mentioned already, very strong demand for grains and oilseeds, food, feed and fuel. So when you think about that backdrop, then you place that sort of what's happening at Corteva, the bottom line is that we see another year of growth and of margin expansion, very consistent with the 2025 framework. And the levers are the same levers we've talked about. So we're going to see and we expect to see significant growth in our new products, our new crop protection products. As you recall, last year, we finalized the spinosad expansion. So we're seeing incremental volume go into the market this year and we'll see growth in 2024 and 2025. I already mentioned royalty expenses but we're probably trending a little ahead of plan to get to the overall $250 million by 2025. And then the thing that we need to unpack a little further but obviously, with crop prices the way they are today in raw material on the chemical side, we are going to see and start to see lower costs flow through the P&L. So when we put this all together, the construct looks very, I think, similar to what we've laid out historically, we don't see any sort of major deviations from what we've communicated. It is early days, so I'll caution you that this is just our initial thinking. But so far, what we would say is that the setup for 2024 looks quite constructive. Operator : Our next question comes from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Joel Jackson : I'll just throw a couple of questions in together. Can you just tell us what you expect crop chems volume formats to be like in the second half of the year? I'm not sure if you're projecting growth year-over-year, just reiterate that. And then maybe for Dave, on free cash flow conversion, you dropped free cash flow a couple of hundred million dollars this year. I know you were hoping to find some way to increase conversion, maybe get to 40% plus number over the next year or so. Can you give us an update on what's going on there and then how you might improve it over the next little while? Dave Anderson : Sure. Let me give you the crop numbers. So it's a really good point because when you look at our numbers, you really have to consider product exits, the strategic decisions that we've made just to get -- just to put that into perspective, on a reported basis, the volume change for the crop business would be round numbers about 16% down for the first half but it's really minus 10% when you take into consideration the exit. So there's about 6 points there of impact in the first half from those decisions. When you look at the second half, what you're looking at Joel is on a reported basis, we've got a volume change of about 4% but on an adjusted basis -- and by the way, this also includes the store acquisition in it. So this is sort of an all-in -- when you look at it all in, it would be up 8%. So we're looking at -- that growth is really a transference significantly of LatAm from 1H to 2H in addition to what we're seeing is sequentially for Brazil, specifically, when you look at the market research data, we're seeing sequentially 1Q to 2Q in the channel, some improvement in overall inventory levels and we're seeing pretty good strength in terms of actual sellout, if you will, in other words, product that's going to the farm gate. So essentially, what we're seeing in the second half is the improvement in terms of related to the timing of LatAm. Chuck Magro : Yes. Just one comment before you talk about free cash flow. Joel, the way Dave has described that the way we think about the market is excluding glyphosate [ph]. So it's a very important call out because we don't play in that market, it's such a large market and such a commodity that when Dave referenced sort of our volumes against the market backdrop, you need to exclude glyphosate [ph], just to call that out. So Dave, over to you on free cash flow. Dave Anderson : Yes. So just very quickly, just to kind of go through a couple of the numbers and then go specifically your question in terms of directionally, what do we see in terms of cash flow and cash flow conversion going forward. So for the first half, as you pointed out, we've had higher use of cash on a year-over-year basis. That's really related to the phenomena of working capital including payables and the payables has to do with more cash outflow in terms of growers comp on the seed side which is all explainable by the size of the business, the growth of the business as well as commodity costs and our pricing actions. On the other side of the payables is trade payables which is really attributable to what we're doing in terms of inventory management, on the crop protection side of the business, where we're really pulling back, obviously, very understandably in terms of procurement there. For the full year, the $1 billion to $1.2 billion translates to, let's say, at the midpoint, $1.1 billion against our EBITDA translates to about a 30% cash conversion at $1.1 billion using our midpoint of our EBITDA guide for the full year, about a 30% conversion to EBITDA which, by the way, is about a 50% conversion if you use the cash to operating earnings relationship, in other words, the numerator of our EPS calculation which is another way to calculate communicate conversion. When you look at what's happening in the second half of the year, it's really -- working capital is really becomes a source of cash and it's really attributable to the fact that we're growing but holding working capital levels basically on a year-over-year basis, holding at constant -- coming down, obviously, from our first half levels in terms of inventory but also increasing in terms of payables. When you look out to 2024 and 2025, again these sort of directional numbers, what we would be looking at for the 2 years, '24, '25 something in the neighborhood of 50% plus in terms of cash flow conversion, if you look at, again, a cash-to-EBITDA relationship that would translate to around 80% plus when you think of cash relative to operating earnings for those periods. And that's dialed in. We've got, we think, the -- all the right disciplines, capabilities, et cetera. And it's consistent with what we referenced earlier in terms of our confidence in our outlook, in terms of our earnings targets for '24 and '25. Operator : I'll take our next question from Frank Mitsch from Xerium Research. Frank Mitsch : I wanted to focus in on the Seed side of things because that was obviously clearly impressive performance and congrats on E3 or Enlist E3 getting to the 55% mark. So you're clearly gaining share on the soybean side. Your corn growth, 20% was also pretty impressive. Can you talk about your overall feelings on market share gains? And what are some of the underlying factors behind that? Tim Glenn : Frank. Yes, I appreciate the comments on success Enlist and how the year turned out. So in terms of market share, maybe a few thoughts here. So as we went -- as we came through the year, we felt -- we could sense obviously, we see customer level order activity and we knew that there was good momentum towards corn and felt like soy was definitely a little bit slower in terms of order and farmers' intentions had shifted a little bit. As we sit here right now, what I would say is very early to declare one way or another. At the time that the June 30 USDA report was included, I think there was still on the order of about 2-plus million acres of corn to be planted from farmers and something north of 6 million acres of soybeans still to be planted. So it opens the door for there to be revisions. We know the USDA will revise those over time. So given where we're at right now at the call it, the 83-plus million acres on soy and 94-plus million acres on corn. We'd be looking at a slight share gain with obviously very strong value capture on corn but that's at the current level of area. In terms of soy, again, we're -- I would have said I felt a little bit more comfortable with our order position throughout the year. It's actually quite a bit stronger of a share gain at that 83-plus million acres. So we feel good about how the year turned out. Clearly, from a value capture standpoint, it was outstanding. And from a volume standpoint, very satisfied at those levels. We're going to continue to look as the USDA revises here over the coming months. If there's material adjustments that made -- that are made that could impact the final share numbers. But that kind of summarizes how we look at share right now. We're not going to declare victory at this point in time but we feel good about where we sit. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : Reach our 2025 EBITDA guide. Do you assume positive pricing in Seed overall for 2024 and 2025? Chuck Magro : David, you hear the question? Dave Anderson : Yes. Jeff [indiscernible]? Sorry, Jeff, did you say do we assume positive pricing in the seed business relative to our '24, '25 financial targets? Yes, the answer would be, yes. Jeff Zekauskas : In order to reach them. Dave Anderson : Another way of saying it is that we think that Seed business, we're going to again price for value and that pricing versus cost assumptions will be accretive to margins. Chuck Magro : Yes, Jeff, it's Chuck. So I think Dave hit it but we've communicated this before, right, is the way we try to price for Seed is price for value. We have a big R&D machine. We're bringing out new hybrids every year. If you looked at some of our recent announcements, we've also brought out what we call our next-gen trade packages. I called out PowerCore actually in our prepared remarks but we also announced for Seed as well. So these are trade packages that are going to be very important for farmers in the next generation. Significant value creation will be there. And we'll certainly price for that. I'd also say that what it does and it helps a lot is it opens up the door for us to out-license this new technology. And maybe, Tim, you can talk a little bit about some of the progress we've seen even with Enlist. Tim Glenn : Yes, absolutely. And I'd say David -- or Jeff, the way we think about '24 and '25 is getting more back to that traditional pricing metric where it's about new products that we bring in. We're constantly bringing in new varieties and hybrids into our lineup that bring more value and that opens the door for us to price. And as Chuck said, it's really exciting when you think about the out-license licensing opportunity. So just 4 years ago, we really didn't participate from a licensing standpoint. And as we sit here today, we've got 4 traits that we're able to license in the marketplace. So in Enlist E3, as we shifted made the significant shift this year into our proprietary [indiscernible] opens up the door for us not just to have the 100 trade licensees that are out there today but all of a sudden, we've got our own proprietary germplasm [ph] that are accessible. And we're making nice gains into that licensing. So in Enlist E3 soybeans in our own Corteva germplasm. In Latin America, we've got Conkesta E3 [ph] soybeans. And again, we're a couple of years out from our proprietary germplasm being there but we've got the most successful breeding organization in Latin America that is introducing varieties into the marketplace there. Chuck talked about PowerCore Enlist Refuge Advance and what that means to us. That is the largest segment of corn in North America that aboveground, insect protection with the integrated refuge. So all of a sudden, we have the opportunity to go out there and participate with our trade [ph]. And then on the smaller scale, we have optimally like canola which we got approval for, not again, not on the same scale as those other opportunities. But again, it allows us to leverage our investment in that technology and again, be able to go out there and generate good returns on that -- in that canola market. So it's an exciting time from an out-licensing standpoint in addition to our ongoing business in the brands. Dave Anderson : And Jeff, just -- this is Dave. Just one final comment to just add to what I said earlier. Just as a reminder and you recall this from our as early as Investor Day last year, communications that most of the pricing the seed pricing will have taken place through 2023. So that's just a kind of a reminder in terms of relative significance of those forward years. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Yes. A couple of more Seed questions. That 12% pricing that you're getting in Seed, what fraction of that is underlying like-for-like pricing versus the share gain or the mix shift because of growers shifting to higher-yielding genetics and then the other bucket being the acreage shift from soy to corn. Can you split that 12% that way? And then the net royalty reduction of $150 million, that was ahead of the guide. Did you pull some from the $100 million target you had for 2024? Did you pull some of that forward in that Enlist maybe has penetrated faster than you thought? And then just lastly, I'd like to hear your view on the value to you if the Europeans do adopt their gene editing rule for seeds? Tim Glenn : Okay. A lot there and I'll take a shot to start off, Steve and good to hear from you today. So when you look at the '23 pricing, North America, obviously, very strong seed pricing overall. And in terms of how you think about it between corn and soy, it would have been driven more by corn than soy. The benefit we had in soy, I would say, is we upgraded a fair amount of our Enlist sales to our proprietary germplasm. So our A series varieties give us more opportunity, higher performing products, so it opened the door for more pricing opportunities on that side. So it was a combination of mix, if you want to think about it in terms of new products, new varieties as well as just flat out pricing for value and pricing performance across the board. So a good mix on both corn and soy [ph]. In terms of royalty neutrality, we're on track for our, call it, $250 million reduction that we've talked about between '22 and '25. The -- I guess, the overperformance, if you want to think about that this year, was driven by a couple of things here. First thing on the Enlist side is that we kind of overdelivered on a couple of fronts, if you will, from a U.S. business standpoint. We ended up with a higher level of our business of our mix and Enlist versus extend. So we're now at about [indiscernible]. That's a little bit higher than what we had planned for. In addition, the adoption of our proprietary germplasm was higher, we're a little over 80% on that side in terms of what our proprietary germplasm is for Enlist. So all those things coupled to allow us to, call it, convert a little bit faster. So it is -- in the end, we're going to -- we're going to be fully converted over here in the next few years. So the fact that we overperformed this year, you can think of it as an acceleration into 2023. And I think Chuck wanted to take the question around gene editing. Chuck Magro : Yes, Steve, great question on gene editing and what's happening in Europe. First of all, just to set the stage. So we believe that gene editing is sort of that next level of agricultural science, very powerful set of tools and has the potential to be more impactful to Seed development and crop development than BT [ph] was 25 years ago. So we're very excited. We've got a full-on R&D program and we are -- this is a space where we are increasing our investment in R&D. The EU proposed policy that came out early July, what I would say is a good start. It's a workable framework, I think, for the industry. It's going to take some time to get through the specifics and that they're on a time line, hopefully, to have clarity of the policy in, I'd say, in the next 1 to 2 years. But so far, what we see is a framework that is relatively connected to the rest of the policy landscape around the world. So what we're hoping is that we'll be able to have freedom to operate in the next 1 to 2 years and we are actively investing in a whole suite of gene editing products and tools. so that we will be ready when the market says that we can start putting these products into the ground. So it is a very exciting part of our overall future development. And I think that what we saw in Europe was a very good first step. Operator : We'll take our next question from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : So I had a question about the trajectory from '23 to '25 going from that 3.6 to say, 4.4 or 4.3 [ph] in the midpoint in '25. It looks like a relatively ratable growth and that would kind of imply 10% EBITDA growth in '24. I know there's a lot of uncertainty and you're still going through the planning process. But how should we think about that? Are there any major buckets that you could help us with? I understand that -- or maybe you could kind of bucket that out by restructuring program gains, royalty reduction, market growth and pricing. Is there any way you could help us with that? Dave Anderson : Arun, I would say this, first of all, again, it's early for us to comment on specifics for 2024 and that's going to be a very important component or installment for us and will give us also follows, obviously, a lot of more detail and color around the components that you're asking about. I think the way I think about it is going back to Investor Day, where we provided the bridge or the walk, if you will, from 2022 forward. And I think the way to think about that, again, it's something we provided. We called it the value creation framework. And it's the same buckets and it's the ones that you just mentioned. The royalty neutrality, we said greater than $250 million, lower net royalties driven by Enlist. We said that we were going to have -- in product mix, we were going to get the benefit of that. That's going to be a margin lift for us not only on the seed business and seed side, as Tim articulated but also in Crop Protection with greater than 60% of our Crop Protection revenue coming from differentiated products. SG&A what we talked about is translating into $400 million of savings. And by the way, just to put a plug in for that in 2023 on a on a, call it, apples-to-apples basis. In other words, excluding acquisitions on a full year basis, we're going to be down north of $50 million despite inflation, despite merit and inflation. So that's a fairly significant testimony to what we're doing on that front. So operational excellence and then more to come, obviously, on -- from both businesses in terms of their, if you will, cost of revenue. And then against that backdrop, as Chuck said, still very much committed to our increased R&D investment, Chuck cited the target of the 8% of revenue for 2025. So those are the same building blocks that are there today very much. I think what you're seeing in terms of our results for the first half and our guide for 2023 really reinforce that. So again, a lot more color, a lot more detail on that to come as we develop and flesh out our '24 plan and communicate that guide to you later. Operator : And I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Booth for any closing remarks. Kim Booth : Thank you. So that concludes today's call. We thank you for joining and for your interest in Corteva. We hope you have a safe and wonderful day. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

At this time, I'd now like to turn the conference over to Kim Booth. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kim Booth : Good morning and welcome to Corteva's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Chuck Magro, Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Anderson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Tim Glenn, Executive Vice President, Seed Business Unit; and Robert King, Executive Vice President, Crop Protection Business Unit, will join the Q&A session. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks during this call, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of the Corteva website and through the link to our webcast. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements which are our expectations about the future. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could materially differ from these statements due to these risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, those discussed on this call and in the Risk Factors section of our reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please note in today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release and related schedules, along with our supplemental financial summary slide deck available on our Investor Relations website. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Magro : Thanks Kim. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. Just over a year ago, we unveiled a strategic framework to enhance Corteva's competitive position while achieving margin expansion and long-term value creation. What we didn't know at the time was how important the efficient execution of that plan would be in delivering continued earnings and margin growth in 2023, a year with no shortage of complicating geopolitical, macroeconomic and ag-specific factors. We're making good progress towards our 2025 earnings and margin targets despite these challenges. Through the first nine months of the year, we generated over 120 basis points of margin expansion. What sets us apart is the strength and balance of our Global Seed and Crop Protection portfolio and our continued focus on controlling our controllables. Our Seed business is delivering exceptional performance in 2023 and is set up for continued growth with our pipeline of technology in new hybrids. For 2024, we will roll out over 200 new hybrids and varieties around the world after more than 300 in 2022 and 2023 combined. This is helping farmers around the world increase yield and production which is reflected in our price for value strategy. Thanks to the continued success of our Enlist platform, where last quarter, we announced having become the number one selling soybean technology in the US, we're expecting to deliver royalty reduction benefits in 2023 of approximately $200 million with another $100 million expected in 2024. This is about a year ahead of our plan to achieve royalty neutrality. And just last week, we announced our next series of Enlist E3 soybeans in North America that builds off our industry-leading A Series performance. More to come on this soon. In Corn, we are delighted to say that we now have a decade view of corn trade technology, which represents a robust market opportunity, including out-licensing, all of which will translate to significant value creation. We're also running ahead in cost and productivity across both of our businesses. Last September, we estimated cumulative run rate savings of $400 million, and we're now set to deliver over $300 million in 2023 alone. And today, we're announcing the next steps in the plan to optimize our global crop production network. The plan includes the exit of production activities at our site in Pittsburgh, California as well as ceasing production at other select locations. These actions will strengthen our competitive position in the market by improving our cost base and increasing supply agility. Dave will describe the plan in greater detail but I'll highlight that we're estimating annual run rate savings of approximately $100 million by 2025 that should significantly enhance our competitiveness and our customer service globally. Overall, the ag markets remain constructive but mixed. Global ag fundamentals remain positive with farmer income still above historical levels. Destocking and crop protection appears to be largely behind us in North America, with an uptick in orders from the channel, but we expect destocking to continue through the current season in Latin America and the upcoming season in Europe. Underlying farmer demand in terms of applications is on track with historical trends. However, just-in-time order patterns, which are most pronounced in Brazil will likely persist into 2024. So, what does all this mean for the remainder of the year? Our current expectation is that our 2023 full year results will still deliver operating EBITDA growth and over 100 basis points of margin expansion. While responding to the local pressures we're experiencing in Brazil, we remain committed to long-term value creation, including returning cash to shareholders as evidenced by the $750 million in share repurchases this year. Turning to the market outlook. We're seeing solid global demand for agricultural production. Global demand for biofuels in 2023 is at a record level, and we expect continued growth in 2024. Global production of many key crops is estimated to be up versus the 2022-2023 crop year, including corn and soybean. Although current USDA estimates for the most recent crop year show it would be the fourth consecutive year of below-trend corn yields in the US, we're starting to see a rebound of US ending corn stocks due to an increase in planted area. This comes after several years of tight stock levels driven by weather challenges. However, total corn and soybean stocks, excluding China, are not back to pre-pandemic levels and are dependent on critical southern hemisphere production, which is even more apparent in soybeans where Brazil is a critical exporter. Meanwhile, corn production in Europe remains markedly below pre-conflict levels, particularly in the Black Sea region, where Ukraine production is down 30%. Brazil is really a tale of two crops. Soybean area is expected to be up in the 2023-2024 crop year based on relative production economics between soybean and corn. Extreme weather varying by region and driven by the El Nino transition are adding an additional level of complexity to current USDA and corn ad crop area estimates. This is all factoring into our latest operating assumptions that both summer and safrinha area will be down. Although the combination of factors at play in Brazil this season are quite complex, this is part of the global agricultural markets ongoing balancing of supply and demand, which is expected to also result in a modest shift from corn to soybeans in the US in 2024. To wrap-up, we believe we have one of the most competitively advantaged ag technology portfolios in the industry. We believe our performance over the past three years speaks for itself. Since the beginning of 2021, our revenues are expected to be up about $3 billion, while delivering an increase of over $1.2 billion of EBITDA. But what perhaps is even more impressive is EBITDA margin improvement approaching 500 basis points. No other company in our space has come even close to that level of performance. And there's even more to come. And now, let me turn the call over to Dave. Dave Anderson : Thanks Chuck and welcome everyone, to the call. Let's start on Slide number 6, which provides the financial results for the quarter and the year-to-date. You can see from the numbers that we continue to deliver operating EBITDA growth and margin expansion despite the mixed market conditions that Chuck outlined. Briefly touching on the quarter. Sales and earnings were largely in line with our expectations. Organic sales were down 13% compared to prior year, with seed pricing gains offset by volume declines in both Seed and Crop Protection. Lower seed volumes were driven by lower expected planted area and delayed farmer purchases in Brazil and an earlier operational finish to the season in North America. Crop Protection volumes were impacted by approximately 95 million in product exits. In addition, we saw inventory destocking in both North America and Latin America and delayed farmer purchases, particularly in Brazil. Turning to year-to-date, sales were down 1% versus prior year, with broad-based pricing gains offset by lower volume. Global pricing was up 9%, with gains in all regions and increases in both Seed and Crop Protection. Feed volume was down 5% versus prior year, largely driven by the decision to exit Russia. Crop Protection volume was down 16%, which includes a 5% impact from product exits. Put in perspective, total exits year-to-date represent a $530 million impact to volume. Now, despite the reduction in the topline growth, strong operational performance translated into operating EBITDA of nearly $3 billion year-to-date, an increase of 5% over 2022. Pricing, favorable product mix, and productivity more than offset higher costs in volume and currency headwinds, driving more than 120 basis points of margin expansion for year-to-date. So, let's now go to Slide 7. You can see the gains in the Seed business were offset by Crop Protection market headwinds year-to-date where total company organic sales declined 1% compared to prior year, which again includes a 4% headwind to volume from the exits. Seed net sales were up 7% through the third quarter to more than $7.8 billion. Organic sales were up 9% on strong price execution as we continue to price for value and offset higher input costs. Global seed price was up 14% year-to-date with gains in every region, led by North America and EMEA. Seed volumes were down 5% versus prior year. Gains in North America, driven by increased corn acres were offset by declines in EMEA driven by the exit from Russia as well as lower corn planted area. In Latin America, due to expected corn planted area and delayed planning, the exit from Russia represented a 3% headwind for the Seed segment. Crop Protection net sales were down 10% versus prior year to approximately $5.7 billion. Organic sales were down 12% with pricing gains, more than offset by lower volume. Global crop protection pricing was up 4% year-to-date as the high single-digit pricing gains from the first half of the year moderate due to increased competitive pressures. Crop Protection volumes were down 16% through the third quarter, impacted by channel destocking, a shift in timing of seasonal demand delaying farmer purchases in Latin America as well as more than $330 million headwind or 5% impact from exits. Currency headwind for the total company was 2%, largely driven by European currencies. And finally, the Biologicals acquisitions added more than $280 million of revenue, which is reflected in portfolio and other. With that, let's go to Slide 8 for a summary of the year-to-date operating EBITDA performance. During the first three quarters, operating EBITDA increased approximately $140 million to just under $3 billion. Year-to-date, we delivered more than $1 billion in pricing and product mix improvement. Pricing gains, coupled with improvement in net royalties, productivity and cost actions more than offset declines in volume and higher cost and currency headwinds. Roughly $460 million of net cost headwind was related to seed commodity costs and unfavorable yield impact as well as Crop Protection inflation on input costs. Crop Protection raw material costs were up 5% versus prior year as we sold through higher cost inventory. Market-driven and other costs were mitigated by approximately $190 million of improvement in net royalty expense and $240 million of productivity savings. SG&A spend year-to-date is up less than 1% versus prior year, including nearly $90 million in SG&A from the Biologicals acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A is down versus prior year by 3% as we maintain disciplined spending despite year-over-year inflation. Currency was a $228 million headwind driven largely by European currencies. Now as Chuck noted, we're taking several large steps to optimize the Crop Protection manufacturing footprint. You can see more details on Slide 9. Although this analysis has been in process for some time, given the current global macroeconomic backdrop in the crop protection industry, we're taking the opportunity to accelerate these actions. We expect to record pretax restructuring and asset-related charges of $410 million to $460 million through the end of 2024, including $320 million to $340 million of noncash asset related and impairment charges. Cash payments related to these actions are anticipated to be $90 million to $120 million, primarily related to the payment of severance and related benefits and contract terminations. And we're estimating annual run rate EBITDA improvement of approximately $100 million by 2025, which translates to a payback of a little more than two years. Of course, we'll keep you posted on the progress of this plan as we deliver a reliable and flexible cost competitive supply network. Turning now to Slide 10. I want to take you through the full year guidance. We now expect net sales for the year to be in the range of $17 billion and $17.3 billion or down 2% at the midpoint, including a 3% impact from portfolio exits. This change from our August guide is driven by lower volume and pricing expectations in Brazil Seeds and Crop Protection. We continue to expect over $400 million of net sales for the full year from the Biologicals acquisitions. Operating EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $3.25 billion to $3.45 billion, 4% growth versus prior year at the midpoint. The updated guidance is driven by lower topline growth, partially offset by productivity and cost actions. These updates translate into an expected operating EBITDA margin of 19.5% at the midpoint of guidance, approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion over 2022. Led by the strength of our Seed business performance. Operating EPS is now expected to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.70 per share, down 3% versus prior year at the midpoint. The change in guidance reflects lower operating EBITDA, partially offset by lower interest expense and lower forecasted effective tax rate and lower share count. Free cash flow is now forecast to be in the range of $600 million and $1 billion, with a change in guidance reflecting the lower earnings range and the forecast for higher inventory and lower payables. And as Chuck mentioned, we expect share repurchases to be approximately $750 million for the year, which includes roughly $580 million that we completed through the third quarter. Let's now transition to the setup for 2024. Slide 12 presents the initial high-level view of our planning framework and provides key assumptions as we begin our internal planning process for 2024. Importantly, using this framework as a starting point, we expect to deliver earnings and margin growth again in 2024. After a 7% increase in US corn acres in 2023, we expect to shift back to soybeans in 2024. While also expecting lower planted area for Brazil, safrinha. But the Ag fundamentals remain relatively healthy with U.S. farmer income and commodity prices above historical average. However, we expect Brazil farmer margins to remain generally tight, particularly in corn due to macro factors, including higher interest rates and lower commodity prices. Our price per value strategy continues to be a key lever, driving organic growth. I think for our yield advantage technology and differentiated solutions is expected to drive low single-digit pricing gains for the total company in 2024. We continue to make progress on our portfolio simplification. We expect another $100 million of volume headwinds related to product exits. Despite the impact of the product exits, we expect Crop Protection volume gains in the US led by new and differentiated products. Brazil volumes are expected to be muted due to ongoing expected market dynamics. Biologicals are expected to grow double-digits with both price and volume gains. Cost and productivity will remain a focus for the organization as we drive improved margins. While we're seeing the prices of raw materials fall, the cost improvements in Seed and Crop Protection will lag stock commodity price trends, driven by the timing of inventory turns. In Seed, we expect another $100 million of improved royalties as we shift to more proprietary technology, and we expect to combine $100 million of productivity in Seed and Crop Protection. We'll continue to tightly manage our SG&A costs with core SG&A expenses increasing less than inflation. R&D will continue to increase as we invest in innovation for the long term. To summarize and highlight, we expect lower revenue growth in 2024 as well as in 2025 versus the level implied in our multiyear revenue targets. Despite this, we're confident in our ability to continue to deliver earnings and EBITDA margin within the range of our 2025 financial framework. So with that, let's go now to Slide 13 and just summarize the key takeaways. Importantly, our third quarter year-to-date operating EBITDA performance is in line with expectations, led by the strength of our Seed business. Continued cost discipline and productivity actions coupled with significant improvement in royalty expenses is making a difference to the bottom line and helping to drive more than 120 basis points of margin expansion year-to-date. The current guidance range reflects updated fourth quarter outlook and importantly, still forecast operating EBITDA and margin growth for the year. The planning framework for 2024 that we shared today supports continued earnings growth and as you would expect will be followed with detailed market analysis and planning assumptions when we release full year 2023 results in early February. With that, let me turn it over to Kim. Kim Booth : Thank you, Dave. Now, let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll first take our first question from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning everyone. Dave, can I just ask you, you made the comment in the slide that you're expecting low single-digit pricing for the company in 2024. It seems like it's driven mostly by Seed, but I'm just trying to get the bridge there because we see pricing in crop chem was down, I think, 4% in the third quarter. You're citing competitive pressures in two of your four major regions, what's the algorithm for next year in terms of getting the total company to flat? Is crop chem going to be positive? Or is it going to be down slightly? And then is the Seed order book giving you confidence in the US that you're going to achieve kind of mid-single-digit-ish price on the Seed side of the equation to get us to low singles for the total company? Dave Anderson : Let me just share with you a couple of highlights. And then, Tim, maybe you could comment a little bit on Vincent's point about Seed. Vincent, you're right. So, low single-digit for the company overall is the expectation right now. And again, this is an early indication and I call it, preliminary view as part of our framework for 2024. For Seed, Tim will comment more specifically, but obviously, we're looking at continued positive, we call it price for value, as you know. So, we think that's going to lead the way in terms of our year-over-year pricing performance. For Robert's business, the Crop Protection business, we think the price is going to be generally favorable with the exception significantly for our LatAm business, where we continue to see pricing pressures. In the aggregate, we think Crop Protection pricing will be potentially up slightly to neutral to down slightly compared to 2024. So taking all that together gets us to the low single-digits for the company. Again, early, Tim, you want to comment on Seed Tim Glenn : Yes, absolutely. And I'll just reemphasize what Dave said on pricing. This year, we had exceptional pricing, roughly 14% year-to-date and very broad by crop and geography, a testament to our technology and how we've executed across the board as an organization. Next year, we do expect that to return to more of a typical call it, low single-digit type of a growth on a global standpoint. And looking at where we're at in North America, maybe the setup there to touch on that, including how things are going from a pricing standpoint and what the order position looks like. We do expect a rotation from corn to soybeans, call it, 3% to 4% of the area shifting back. We're well advanced in terms of harvest in North America from a farmer standpoint. And I'd say farmers are very satisfied with our product. And that puts our current order book in a good spot for this time of year, allowing for the shift from corn to beans. That said, the next 45 days are really critical for us as we lock up our business for 2024 and secure payment. But the order position is good, our price position in the marketplace. We've been out there since August in front of customers and putting proposals in place and it's holding strong. So we feel very good about what our opportunity there. And we continue to have excellent momentum in the marketplace in North America. So strong value proposition, strong execution by the team. And so we feel good about how we're setting up for 2024 in North America despite the shift from corn to beans. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our next question from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Chuck, have any of the changes you've seen in Crop Protection impacted your confidence in achieving the midpoint of the 2025 EBITDA guidance of $4.4 billion? Chuck Magro : Yes, good morning David. So, obviously, it's a pretty dynamic market that we're operating in right now. Let me just give you sort of what we're thinking. And it's a very good question. And obviously, we'll have a lot more to say as we give final results for the full year of 2023 in February, and then we'll really be able to talk about 2024 and with a level of degree of specifics that we just can't get into today. But I'd say right now, the entire Corteva organization, it's remaining very highly focused on hitting that $4.1 billion to $4.7 billion with the 21% to 23% EBITDA margins. I'm not going to talk about the specifics in terms of exact numbers because I think the key, I think, for us is that we're still feeling very good that we're within that range. And if you think about that just for a minute, a couple of years ago, just look at what's happened, right, over the last two years, we've had the Russia invasion of Ukraine. We've had a global chemical destocking, and now we're seeing weakness in Brazil, which we haven't seen weakness in Brazil since 2015. But when you put all that together, it's pretty clear that we've also overachieved when it comes to some of the controllables. So if you recall that the framework that we laid out last year, it had 4 buckets, portfolio simplification, royalty neutrality, product mix and what we called operational excellence. And these were largely in our control, and we've made very good progress. In fact, on a lot of these dimensions and elements, Dave in his prepared remarks commented, we're running a year and sometimes a little ahead of program there. So, we're finding ways as a management team and as an organization to offset some of the market headwinds that we've been -- have been put in front of us. So, I guess what I'd say right now is that when we look at the 2025 targets, we're still very comfortable we're well within that range. And that, of course, assumes that we don't see another significant step down in Brazil, for example, because we are planning as part of that 2025 framework that there's modest growth in Brazil over the next couple of years. So, if that was not to unfold, then we would obviously have to find ways to offset that weakness. And we've been pretty good at offsetting the weakness. If you think about just the acceleration of Enlist on those acres, that royalty neutrality is actually, we're making better progress than we thought there. The productivity and cost management issues in this organization, I've been very impressed with, our SG&A barely hasn't moved on an apples-to-apples basis. And now that just yesterday, we announced sort of that next level of our operational efficiency program. This is something that's been in the work for a very long time. We're quite pleased with the progress, and that will add to the operational excellence and cost management of the organization. So, when you put it all together, there's always puts and takes but we're feeling very good that we're still on the right track when it comes to delivering that framework. Operator : Thank you. And we'll next go to Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Joel Jackson : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm looking at your crop chem's manufacturing rationalization plan, can you maybe highlight some of the major changes? You did highlight a high level on the slide last night. Maybe talk about some of the low-hanging fruit, which molecules are you moving externally? Which one did you want to make sure you're keeping internally. Maybe just some really good, maybe a few anecdotes or low-hanging fruit you could talk about that's really driving this plan? Thank you. Chuck Magro : Yes, good morning Joel. let me start with sort of the genesis of the program and the framework and the objectives, and then I'll turn it over to Robert to give you a bit more specifics. So, as you well know, I hired Robert about year and a half ago to run the Global Chemical business. And the program started almost immediately thereafter. So, we've been on this journey for well over a year when it comes to looking at CP ops. And really what we did, and Robert led the charge here for the organization is, we went out and we looked at sort of chemical operation best practices from literally around the world. . So it's been a very comprehensive review. It's been underway for a very long time. And it's a multi-program kind of programs that we're thinking about that will take us through, I'd say, the next couple of years and the benefits that you're going to see, we laid out some of the benefits for 2025 on a run rate basis of about $100 million. That was some of the work that we accelerated. But the real benefit for the program won't really bite until kind of post 2025. We're thinking that there's going to be very significant benefits between 2025 and 2030. And really, the objectives are -- if you think about our vision is, we want to bring our CP ops into kind of the modern operating world of chemicals. Safety is one of our core values. It's very important to our company, and that would be at the first and the top of the list when it comes to the objectives that we're trying to implement here. We also want to improve our supply reliability. We think we handled COVID pretty well. I think our performance was very good, but we -- but there's always room for improvement there. And then, of course, cost competitiveness. This industry is shifting. It's quite dynamic, and we want to maintain our global cost competitiveness. So, what you're going to see is that we're going to shift the model to sort of more asset-light and use really some third-party manufacturing, but really drive supply redundancies. That's going to be critical. And then some of the key technology that we own, and as you know, our portfolio is increasing in this area, those are assets that we're going to manufacture molecules from ourselves and really invest in modernization, driving advanced control technologies and in some cases, and this is important, we're going to be moving to sort of the next generation of CP manufacturing, which is modular or flexible type technology because. In today's world, the next generation of CP, we don't require big volumes in massive plants anymore. These -- and then, of course, you know the IP footprint is accelerating. So, when you think about what's needed in the next generation of CP, we need smaller, more nimble facilities that we can produce these plants relatively cheap products relatively cheaply, and that will move us into sort of that modular manufacturing mode. So, that's kind of the vision that we had for CP. And then, Robert, maybe you can just give a little bit specific in terms of the announcement that we made yesterday. Robert King : Yes, the announcement yesterday is one that will be a big step forward for us. It's -- when you look at the pieces that Chuck laid out there, really focused on what can we control. And this one is a big part of the strategy that we laid out at Investor Day, where we're -- our journey is to become excellent in operations, and we don't take that lightly. It really underscores the approach of shifting more to an external supply balance with asset-light capital. That's going to improve our cost competitiveness and our network flexibility to be able to respond and change with the ever-changing markets that we're in. . The thing about this is that this is something that we started on about a year ago, I think, as Chuck said. But we've been able to do some acceleration. The environment has allowed us to do some acceleration, but we've been working on this for some time. So, the execution of these actions is going to allow us to not only drive profitability. But we're going to be much more competitive in the market from a cost standpoint, and it puts us much further down the road. Operator : Thank you. And we'll next go to Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning everyone. A question on cash flow and deployment. If I consider your updated guidance on free cash flow as well as the remainder on your share repurchase commitment for 2023. It seems like you could end the year with more or less zero net leverage. So two questions would be, is that fair or not? And more broadly, Chuck, what are you thinking about deployment for 2024 and beyond? Chuck Magro : Why don't, Dave, you talk about the numbers and then I'll answer the deployment question. Dave Anderson : Yes. Kevin, so yes, thank you, Chuck. So Kevin, exactly. I think you're right. Just to refresh, we've updated the free cash flow guide as of today to that $600 million to $1 billion for the full year. Really, the difference as we pointed out in the prepared remarks really has to do with some higher inventory levels as a result of reduced volume outlook as well as lower payables, which goes with what Robert also stated just in terms of managing our current production capacity in light of the market demand or overall volume. So, your estimate about essentially being zero net debt, I think that's a reasonable forecast at this stage when you think about where we are in translating that cash flow. And it does include, as we mentioned, the $750 million of share buyback for this year. Chuck, do you want to comment a little bit about 2024? Chuck Magro : Yes, sure. So, Kevin, the way we're thinking about it, the $800 million at the midpoint that Dave provided and then the strength of this balance sheet, we have a lot of financial flexibility as an organization. We also have an A- credit rating. So, when you put all that together, and we've made very good progress, I think, on managing our working capital. It's been challenging because of the destocking that went through the global industry. But we don't think that next year will require, Dave, a significant investment in working capital. In fact, it could be a source of cash. Dave Anderson : Yes, definitely. Chuck Magro : When you put all that together, we think that there will be incremental free cash flow in 2024. So, your question is a good question, how are we thinking about it? And the way we're thinking about it is we think that the formula that we've got right now works. We prioritize organic growth in the organization. And as you know, we're increasing investment in R&D. We're absolutely committed to that. We think it's the right thing to do longer term. But we also are now returning a significant capital to shareholders, which we have been a very good track record of doing that. And this year, 750 is a testament to that. And I would expect these decisions are obviously Board decisions, but I would expect that that formula that has served us well, I think, is something that we will certainly have a very good look at going into 2024. The other area, though, will be in organic growth. So, last year, we made two acquisitions in Biologicals, and I'd say we're very pleased about the performance. Even in this market backdrop, the Biologicals businesses are performing very well, and Dave gave some of those numbers today. And even next year, these businesses are expected to grow double-digits. So, we would be looking for other acquisitions or mergers or commercial relationships in the biological space for sure. And then, of course, any other opportunities that we think would drive long-term shareholder value. And so I think what you're going to expect to see is really a balanced approach to the allocation of capital. Organic growth, some inorganic growth perhaps and return of capital. Operator : Thank you. And we'll next go to Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Good morning. Just curious now that chlorpyrifos is back in the news and the courts have rejected the EPA's decision of a couple of years ago and is now allowing it. I know that you guys had -- I believe you stopped producing it a couple of years ago. I'm just curious if you have any updated thoughts regarding chlorpyrifos and the recent rulings and what your future strategy might be there. Dave Anderson : Really no change in our thinking, Frank, at this point in time. This is a business we made decision to exit. Strategically, it fits as well -- that decision fits as well with our overall portfolio criteria today. So, appreciate the question, but no real change, no update in terms of our thinking. Operator : Thank you. And next, we'll go to Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. Don't your crop chemicals have registrations that specify where they're manufactured, and thus, is that -- is that a challenge for you to shutter facilities because then you'd have to have the respective registrations in countries and crops revised? Or is that less of an issue for the plants you're targeting. You mentioned Pittsburgh, California. Are we right on that. That's where you make your nitrogen stabilizer, which wouldn't have any relevance to registrations? Is that right? And maybe one broader crop chem question, and that is any lessons learned on the destocking that you've seen this year that you had a competitor yesterday that doesn't seem to have that same issue. Is there some fundamental reason why this is more challenging for some than others? Chuck Magro : Good morning Steve, maybe Robert, you can answer the registration questions, and I can come back with the lessons learned. Robert King : Sure. Yes, Frank [ph], you're right. Anything that we produce does have registrations. It does tie to where it's made. And then, of course, where it's applied. Optinyte is one of the main products that is made out of Pittsburgh that is our nitrogen stabilizer. It goes into what brand name N-Serve and Instinct NXTGEN. And both of those are leading industry-leading nitrogen stabilizers that is a good business for us. And so we have plans to move that production to another location. We will continue to serve our customers seamlessly through this time, and we'll be in a better position in the future for this product to continue to serve the market. So, the registrations and things are part of the planning process when any time we move products are we -- many times, we always have redundancy built into our system. And so we have other plants registered many times. This is one that we'll be move into registration and that's all in the plans and timing of the overall transition here. So yes, good question, absolutely something we have to do, and it's always in the planning when we go to rearrange our network. Chuck Magro : And Steve, on the global CP destocking, look, I think every player in the industry has been involved in this in some dimension or degree. So are there lessons learned? Obviously, there is. And when we look back on it -- were there signs of sort of a buildup in the channel? Yes. There was. We watch this data very carefully. We have a lot of insights in terms of what's going to ground and what's going into the channel. And when you look back over the last couple of years, it was pretty clear that the demand on the farm was nice and consistent. And that was a good observation. It still remains that way today. but there was more product going in the channel than going out of the channel and so that was clear. But like we've internally discussed these were orders that were coming from long-established partners in the channel. These are major players that manage their inventory quite well, and these were real orders. And so when we started to think about this, I'm not sure we missed that. I think that there was a view that perhaps the on-farm demand would continue to increase. And that didn't happen, obviously, but the demand has been quite steady. I'd say if there was one area where when we look back now and we see what's happening in Brazil, because look, the US destocking, I'd say, is more or less, and there are pockets, but more or less behind us, which is the good news. But in Brazil, what we're seeing is that there's still elevated channel inventories. And that dynamic is different. The influence there that we're finding is that there is a significant amount of generic supply coming into the country, which is impacting the overall products that are available in Brazil, and that is slowing down the destocking And some of this data is visible and some of this data is less visible, and it was very difficult to put it all together. But it is pretty clear to us now that we've got sort of a unique situation in Brazil. That where we're seeing sort of generic pressure coming into the marketplace. And that is an area where we -- whether we are the only company that missed it, I don't know about that. But it is something that was -- that once we started to look for it, you could clearly see that there's elevated inventories now coming in from offshore from -- mostly from China. Operator : Thank you. And next, we'll go to Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. There are two questions. In terms of your operating cash flow, you're $460 million behind where you were last year when you generated roughly $900 million in operating cash flow. So, to get to the bottom of your operating cash flow range of $1.2 billion, you've got to do $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter versus roughly $3 billion last year, and your inventories are higher and receivables are higher and payables are lower. Can you really get to that to the bottom of the range? And then secondly, on a normal basis, what should your operating cash flow be in general or relative to your EBITDA? It gyrates so much positively and negatively. Dave Anderson : Yes, Jeff, those are -- this is Dave. Those are good questions. So, you're right, there's a lot of free cash flow or cash from operations to be generated in the fourth quarter. When you look at it, though, on a year-over-year basis, if you will, the change on the change, it's significantly related to receivables slowdown reduction, which is very understandable in the light of the revenue outlook. And by the way, while DSOs have ticked up a bit, they're still within a very healthy parameters compared to historic averages. And then the other thing is inventory because we are bringing inventories down as a result of the volume declines. And as I mentioned earlier, and Robert referenced also the reduction in procurement or purchasing as a result of those lower volumes. So, both receivables and inventory will be sources of cash on a year-over-year basis, an important deliverable in the fourth quarter. Payables on the other hand will represent a headwind. Deferred revenue is not much of a change compared to prior year. So that's really not significant. It doesn't play really into it. It's really a working capital story. In terms of run rate, kind of where we want to be, where we need to be, I'm going to use free cash flow as opposed to cash from operations. So, after CapEx, free cash flow, we think, again, in the range of building to 40% then to 50% and so forth is very, very reasonable for the company. In 2024, when we look forward, we'll again have positive from working capital, we believe. We'll have a little bit of increase as a result of what we just mentioned. On the restructuring, for the Crop Protection business in terms of cash outflow on a year-over-year, there are some other puts and takes. But next year should be a good year for cash flow for the company. Thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thank you. Good morning everyone. I wanted to maybe come back to the Brazil destocking and Crop Protection volume outlook a little bit more closely. And maybe just can you be a little more clear on what the volume expectations would be for Brazil and Latin America broadly in the fourth quarter on volumes? And how at this juncture, are you thinking about the shape of that volume through 2024 given what potentially could be more carryover inventory if channel inventories are still high and planted area, especially for corn isn't actually growing? Chuck Magro : So, Dave, do you want to cover that and I can provide some comment-- Dave Anderson : Yes, yes., So we will see some growth in the fourth quarter in Brazil. And part of the reason is it compares to -- and this is on the crop protection side. It compares to an order pattern and a sales pattern last year, which, as you recall, was much more significantly accelerated. We saw basically a very significant increase in orders last year for Brazil. compared to this year in terms of the quarterly pattern. When we look for 2024, our preliminary thinking, and I think I had mentioned this earlier in the prepared remarks, we're looking at basically kind of flattish or muted volume growth on a year-over-year basis. We expect some of the macro conditions to continue that are characterized in the second half of this year. Chuck Magro : Yes. Adam, the way I think about this is if you think about Q4, CP Brazil, the midpoint of the guide or the guidance range we're going to see continued weakness both in volumes and CP in our business and price because of the influence that that Dave just described. And the channel still has to go through some destocking. So, the way to think about Q4 is continued weakness in terms of volumes and some stress on price because of the destocking that we expect will continue at least into the first couple of quarters of 2024 because the channel is destocking, the rate of destocking, though, is just lower than we had expected. And so when I look at this, I'd say we're going to get to a destock Brazil. I can't tell you exactly when. But from a planning perspective, going to assume that at least for the first two quarters of 2024 that we're going to see some weakness when it comes to overall volumes because of the destocking. Dave Anderson : And let me correct because I was looking at another data point when I referenced the Latin America Crop Protection, we're actually going to see volume declines in the fourth quarter in Crop Protection. So correct that. Operator : Thank you. And next we'll go to Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks and good morning everyone. I just wanted to follow up on competitive dynamics in Brazil. Specifically the shift to more generic supply? And how do you think this is going to evolve in terms of long-term competitive status of that market and also pricing next year? Chuck Magro : Yes. So, I guess at the highest level, we still think Brazil is a fantastic market. It's one of the only markets in the world that will continue to grow production. And certainly, Corteva is absolutely committed to the market. In fact, if you think about Brazil over the last -- in 2015, the last time we sort of had a pause in that market, soybean hectares are up something like 30%. Corn hectors up something like 40%. So, it's just been a great growth market. And a lot of companies have enjoyed that. But Brazil has never been a straight line up nor will I believe that it will ever be an easy market to do business in. And there's going to be periods I think where we're going to see a pause or even a step back. But we're still highly committed to this market. Now, when I talk about generics, I guess, let me define it for you. These are organizations that produce molecules that are -- it's not the off-patent companies. These organizations have no local representation in country and no service, which is very important. They ship the bulk molecule into the country and then they assume that it will be picked up distributors or a lot of times it goes direct to large farmers. That's how we define generics. And generics have always been a part of the global CP market. I don't think there's anything new here except potentially one thing. So generics have always been part of the global market. It's always been a slightly larger part of the Brazilian CP market. Where I think we've been observing in the last, I'd say, three months or so is that there's a new level of aggressiveness when it comes to pricing. And in fact, we would say that a lot of these molecules, the prices that they're selling for would not cover their full costs. So, where does this go to your question? We think that this is not sustainable, and there's a lot of reasons why that is. But there is a performance trade-off for these AIs that I think it's important. Many of these AIs are older chemistry and so they'll have resistance issues. And a lot of the farmers, I'd say many or most of the farmers, really want the service. And in Brazil, especially technology does matter. Given the insect and disease pressure that, that country has, you can get away with generics for a short period of time, perhaps and make the cost performance trade-off. But longer term, I think that there's going to be a growing place for differentiated technology, especially when it's backed by high service. And so we don't think that this is a structural change in the country, but it is a reality today that we have to deal with. Operator : Thank you. And we'll next go to Ben Theurer from Barclays. Ben Theurer : Yes, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to -- if you can maybe elaborate a little bit also on what you're seeing in the other markets. We spent a lot of time in North America and South America right now. But looking into some of the dynamics in EMEA and Asia-Pacific, like early stage, how do you think about these two regions looking into 2024? In a similar way, you've provided us a framework for North America and Brazil and some of the commentary. Anything you can share on EMEA and APAC? Thank you. Chuck Magro : Yes. So, let me give you the backdrop and then I'll turn it over to Tim, maybe you can cover Seed and Robert, you can cover CP. The backdrop, as we said in the prepared remarks, the fundamentals are still they're still robust. They're mixed, given the Brazil weakness we're seeing. But there has been record demand for biofuels. And in fact, feed demand is quite high in North America. So global stocks to use are ticking up a little bit. But overall, what we're expecting is that there'll still be healthy farmer dynamics, and that's exactly what we're seeing. Farmers are still prioritizing their investments in yield and production. They're managing this very, very well. And we don't see a very significant shift in sort of buying behavior, except for the kind of the thing we've talked about many times, they move just in time. So, the overall Ag market fundamentals are healthy. And maybe, Tim, you can talk about -- go around the regions in seed and then we'll do the same thing in CP. Tim Glenn : Yes, Chuck. So EMEA, as you can see from our results this year, a lot of volume pressure in EMEA, really strong pricing. So excellent results considering how the volume was down, but take rush off the table as that was a big chunk of our volume decrease in Europe. We saw a general reduction in the planted area this year for corn as a lot of, what I'd say, stranded corn in Ukraine was migrating into Europe and put a lot of pressure on the local commodity price, farmers planted less corn. As we go into next year, we see that situation, I would describe it as stabilizing. So, not necessarily a recovery, but stabilization is the way I think about it from a European seed standpoint, which is a positive step. That was -- that's a very positive step. We talked about North America, so I won't touch on that. Latin America, obviously, this year, heavily influenced by the, I'll call it, [indiscernible] corn in Brazil, reducing the summer and safrinha area. And I'd say sort of a recovery in Argentina, although they're still dealing with a little bit of weather issues. And as we go into 2024, 2025, we get past this season. Our assumption is that Brazil, we will absorb that stranded corn that's been putting pressure on the commodity and that they'll be back to more of a typical, call it, a recovery kind of a flat. We'll assume more like flat to slightly up low single-digit on corn area next year. And in terms of Asia-Pacific, very small for us in Seed. We do business in specific countries there. I'd say in the ASEAN countries, heavy dependence upon the El Nino effect and what that does, local weather conditions, markets are generally strong, just sort of weather-dependent. Asia-Pacific -- or excuse me, India or South Asia healthy market, I'd say, good demand for corn and oilseeds there, which is hybrid mustard. And again, a little bit of weather dependence there as we go through, but fundamentally strong and businesses are in a good spot for us. Chuck Magro : Robert, CP? Robert King : I'll walk around CP. We will start over in EMEA this year and moving forward, we're seeing a good pull on our high-technology molecules and the new products over there. And with the challenges that you see from a CP, I guess, regulatory environment, social pressures in Europe, they have a special challenge that we don't have everywhere else yet. And our products are doing very well there. When you think about some of the products like [Indiscernible] that is that is a herbicide that is in the cereals area. There is one that's doing very well. And the low use rate of that is something that plays to the environmental regulations there. This is the one you think about a sugar pack, it covers two hectares and the technology that's going into that. The other thing in Europe that is going to be an opportunity for us as we move forward is the acquisitions around the Biologicals and the growth that we'll begin to see in Europe as we progress over the next few years with registrations and new products there. It plays right into the need there, especially in the fruits and vegetables market of Europe, there is a big need for new technology for these growers. And so we're seeing good progress in Europe. We expect we gained market share this last year, and we're positioning for a good year this next year as we move forward. Shifting over to Asia, as Tim said, the weather there has been a challenge shifting from -- into El Nino from La Nina. And that has put India planted acres this year down, but those will recover. This is a shift in weather, and we will see that rice planted acres rebound this next year. The thing about Asia is that we have some really good products going into the rice market. Rinskor being a new one that has been launched that controlled herbicide in rice and then mix that with our Brown Plant hopper product Pyraxalt. And we've got leading technology products there that will grow in this rice market of Asia that we have. When you look at the inventory in Asia, we're in a pretty good spot. Despite the weather despite the slowness that we've seen in some places I would say that we're in a much better position than others that have some pretty hot inventory in the channel. And we expect as soon as some of the things shift there, we're going to be in a really good position moving forward. Finally, I'll leave you with Japan. And as you think about that market, we don't speak about it a lot because it's not huge for us. But again, large fruit and vegetable market, Biologicals plays well into that area, plus some of our low use rate new products. And so overall, in Asia, we expect a continued growth. We expect that technology is going to continue to play a big part, and we're well positioned for both. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our final question from Joshua Spector from UBS. Lucas Beaumont : Good morning. This is Lucas Beaumont on for Josh. So I was just wondering if you could please expand for us on your comments regarding the flow-through of the Seed and Crop Chem costs next year. So, you mentioned sort of more of a lag of higher costs sort of flowing through inventory and into the P&L. So, I mean if you could sort of disaggregate some of that for us into like whether you expect costs to be sort of up or down next year between Seed and Crop Chems and maybe overall, like if you need to split it between first half, second half to help us kind of highlight the lag impact, that would be great. Thank you. Dave Anderson : Okay. So, this is Dave. Yes, thanks for the question. So, we're starting to see, as you know, we're seeing the price -- cost of raw materials fall. We indicated in our prepared remarks that we are seeing continued inflation in the third quarter for the Crop Protection business, but that's going to now start to come down in the fourth quarter. And we anticipate, again, early, but we anticipate favorability in 2024 on a year-over-year basis. In both Seed and Crop, it's going to be influenced by inventory turns, which as a result of inventory then translating into cost of goods sold and the timing of that. That's going to be a little bit of a buffer, if you will, against just either spot, ingredient or input costs or spot commodity costs in the case of seed. It will be a little bit also slower to actually translate in terms of cost benefit in the first half of the year just because of that phenomenon. It just takes a while. But overall, we're heading in the right direction. I feel very good and more to come in 2025. So we'll see another lift, another improvement as we look out to 2025. Operator : Thank you. I'd like to now turn the call back to Ms. Kim Booth for any final remarks. Kim Booth : And that concludes today's call. We thank you for joining and for your interest in Corteva. We hope you have a safe and wonderful day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd now like to turn the conference over to Kim Booth. Please go ahead. Kim Booth : Good morning and welcome to Corteva's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Chuck Magro, Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Anderson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Tim Glenn, Executive Vice President, Seed Business Unit; and Robert King, Executive Vice President, Crop Protection Business Unit, will join the Q&A session. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks during this call, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of the Corteva website and through the link to our webcast. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are our expectations about the future. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could materially differ from these statements due to these risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, those discussed on this call and in the Risk Factors section of our reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please note in today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release and related schedules, along with our supplemental financial summary slide deck available on our Investor Relations website. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Magro : Thanks Kim. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. I hope your year is off to a great start. There are several key takeaways I'd like to share with you today, including an overview of the market fundamentals, our solid 2023 performance, and an update on our path to incremental value creation by 2025 with a closer look at what's ahead for 2024. First, I would say that our 2023 performance validates the effectiveness of our value creation strategy and its key levers of portfolio simplification, royalty neutrality, product mix, and operational improvements. At our core, we are a technology company and last year, we had more than 400 new product launches. In Seed alone, we introduced 300 new hybrids or varieties, two new product concepts, and 41 new trade or stack registration approvals. In Crop Protection, our team delivered and launched about 140 new products in two new actives, Adavelt and Reklemel, the latter being the first of its kind, selective nematicide that also has beneficial soil characteristics. The outcome of the strategic and operational actions implemented over the last two years demonstrates the significant progress we have made in converting every dollar of sales into more cash and earnings. With this solid momentum, we entered 2024 on well-positioned and are confident in our ability to deliver value to our customers and other stakeholders. As we look ahead, overall ag fundamentals remain constructive. Large global crop production is being met with rare demand for grain, oilseeds, and biofuels. In North America, corn production and yield for the 2023-2024 crop year is expected to hit a new record despite the productivity challenges that farmers must face related to weather and disease, a testament to the importance of ag technology. Brazil could be the exception with weather influencing crop stress and planting decisions. Commodity prices have declined from their peaks as global stocks to use have grown, but remain elevated as demand continues to keep pace with production. Global crop area is forecasted to increase in 2024 with a modest shift in the US from corn to soybeans. In addition, US farm income remains above the historical average, slow down from its 2022 peak. What has not changed is farmer demand for breakthrough innovation and technology, including seeds that maximize yields which, in turn, boost farmer revenue. With on-farm demand remaining overall strong, the crop protection industry is still going through what we refer to as a rebalance as it recovers from de-stocking that had a challenging and abrupt impact on the market in 2023. While we expect this to continue to normalize throughout the first half of 2024, we're seeing signs of improvement, which gives us more confidence in what the crop protection market should look like as we enter the second half of this year. Once we get into 2025, we expect the imbalance between product going into the channel versus what is being applied on the farm to be back in sync. On full year results for 2023, Corteva continued to deliver with 5% operating EBITDA growth and 116 basis points of margin expansion. Our Seed business, in particular, had an outstanding year with Enlist E3 soybeans achieving the status of being the number one selling soybean technology in the United States, where it reached 58% market penetration. The Enlist system, including our herbicide offerings reached $1.7 billion in sales in 2023, growing in a well-supplied market. Our new product sales held steady year-over-year at about $1.9 billion for the full year and the Biologicals business had a strong year, delivering both top and bottom line growth. Between strong demand for our innovative seed technology, costs and working capital discipline, as well as healthy farmer income levels in North America, our free cash flow in 2023 exceeded our previous estimate, coming in at about $1.2 billion. We returned approximately $1.2 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases for the full year, while also funding approximately $1.5 billion of acquisitions. Turning to 2024. And I'll turn this over to Dave in just a minute but at a high level, we should expect to see another year of meaningful margin expansion with a heavy focus on cash generation. As a result, we expect to deliver 2% top line and 6% operating EBITDA growth at the midpoint, which reflects another incremental EBITDA margin improvement of nearly 100 basis points. We foresee another year of strong cash flow generation and plan to execute $1 billion in share repurchases over the course of 2024. Now, let's spend a few minutes on key themes as we transition from 2023 into 2024. In 2024, we expect Seed to have another strong year as farmers continue to look to effective technology to boost yields, while offsetting the effects of climate change and increasing pest pressures. In Crop Protection, we're expecting volume growth but also continued pricing pressures, so low single-digit sales growth overall. We expect to increase our Biological sales by double digits and nearly double earnings. And although, we expect the effects of de-stocking to linger through the first half of the year in certain regions, we're beginning to see the benefits of cost deflation. All-in, we believe volume gains from our differentiated portfolio, as well as operational improvements and a modest recovery in Brazil will more than offset expected price headwinds. We plan to launch more than 300 new seed hybrids and varieties, putting much needed solutions in farmers' hands. Our Seed pipeline is the best in the industry. Promising technologies like gene editing will make our innovation more effective, sustainable and accessible to everyone from startups to large customers. The incremental yields from the advanced technologies in our pipeline allow us to continue our long-standing price-for-value strategy. Importantly, we have adjusted the 2025 financial framework based on current market factors. The expectation is for continued strong EBITDA growth off the 2023 base and EBITDA margin rate of 21% to 23% in 2025. Benefits from our self-help actions give us the ability to invest in R&D and future innovation. The overall strategy is very much intact. Differentiation in our portfolio, strengthening our route to market and cost performance are all driving value. This is the formula that has been working and will continue to work for Corteva. With that, let me turn the call over to Dave. Dave Anderson : Thanks, Chuck, and welcome, everyone, to the call. Let's start on slide 6, which provides the financial results for the quarter and full year. You can see from the numbers that both for the fourth quarter and the full year, we continued to deliver operating EBITDA growth and margin expansion. Quickly touching on the quarter, sales and earnings were largely in line with our expectations. Organic sales were down 8% compared to prior year with Seed pricing gains offset by volume declines in both Seed and Crop Protection. Seed volume gains in North America and Europe were offset by volume declines in Latin America and Asia Pacific. In Crop Protection, as expected, we saw continued inventory destocking in both Latin America and Europe. Importantly, we did see volume gains in North America as destocking in the region seems to be largely behind us. Turning to the full year, organic sales down 3% versus last year with pricing gains offset by lower volume. This includes a 4% impact from product exits. Total company pricing was up 7% with double-digit Seed pricing and price gains in all regions. Despite the reduction in top line growth, strong operational performance translated into operating EBITDA of nearly $3.4 billion for the year, an increase of 5% over prior year and margin expansion of 116 basis points. And finally, free cash flow for the year 2023 was approximately $1.2 billion or 35% conversion rate on EBITDA. The improvement in free cash flow from last year was driven by increased earnings and working capital improvement, primarily inventory and accounts receivable with a partial offset from accounts payable. Let's now go to slide 7 to review sales by segment. Seed net sales were up 5% to nearly $9.5 billion. Organic sales were up 7% on strong price execution as we continue to price for value. Global seed pricing was up 13% with gains in every region and across the portfolio. Seed volumes were down 6% versus last year. Gains in North America, driven by increased corn acres were offset by declines in Latin America due to lower expected corn planted area and delayed planting in Europe driven by the exit from Russia and lower corn planted area. The exit from Russia represented a 2% volume headwind for the Seed business. Crop Protection net sales were down 9% compared to last year to approximately $7.8 billion. Organic sales were down 12% with pricing gains more than offset by volume. Crop Protection pricing was up 2% and driven by demand for new products. Crop Protection volumes were down 14% for the year, impacted by channel destocking and Brazil market dynamics as well as more than $400 million headwind or 5% impact from exits. Finally, the Biologicals acquisitions added approximately $400 million of revenue, which is reflected in Portfolio and Other. With that, let's go to slide 8 for a summary of full year operating EBITDA performance. For the year, operating EBITDA increased approximately $160 million to about $3.4 billion. Pricing gains, coupled with improvement in net royalties, productivity and cost actions more than offset declines in volume and higher cost and currency headwinds. The approximately $380 million of cost headwinds was related to seed commodity costs and unfavorable yield impact as well as crop protection inflation on input costs. Crop Protection raw materials costs were up 2% versus prior year. Importantly, we're starting to see the impact of lower input costs. During the second half of the year, Crop Protection raw material cost trends in to low single-digit deflation. Market-driven and other costs were mitigated by approximately $200 million of improvement in Seed net royalty expense and $285 million of productivity savings. SG&A spend for the full year was roughly flat versus prior year, including $130 million in SG&A from the Biologicals acquisitions. If you exclude the acquisitions, SG&A was down nearly 5% versus prior year as we maintain disciplined spending, coupled with lower incentive comp accruals despite year-over-year inflation. Let's now transition to a discussion on the guidance for 2024 on slide number 9. We expect net sales to be in the range of $17.4 billion and $17.7 billion, representing 2% growth at the midpoint, driven by seed pricing and volume growth in both Seed and Crop Protection on demand for new and differentiated technology. Volume growth will be muted by approximately $100 million of product exits in 2024. Operating EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion or more than 6% improvement over prior year at the midpoint. Margin is also expected to improve with price and product mix, cost deflation and productivity actions translating to 90 basis points at the midpoint. Operating EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.70 and $2.90 per share, an increase of 4% at the midpoint, which reflects earnings growth and lower average share count, partially offset by higher net interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. We expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.5 billion and $2 billion, with higher earnings and working capital improvements, partially offset by higher net interest and cash taxes. At the midpoint, it translates to a free cash flow to EBITDA conversion rate of roughly 50%. Note that the free cash flow was revised to utilize cash from operations on a continuing basis. Turning to Slide 10, you can see the operating EBITDA bridge for 2024 from approximately $3.4 billion in 2023 to $3.6 billion at the midpoint for 2024. Total company pricing in 2024 is expected to be flat to modestly up with low single-digit pricing in Seed to be offset by declines in Crop Protection pricing given ongoing destocking, particularly in Brazil and global market dynamics. Importantly, we do expect volume gains in both Seed and Crop Protection. Seed volume gains are driven by expected increased US soybean acres in planted area in Brazil, safrinha for the 2024/2025 season. In Crop Protection, we expect mid-single-digit volume growth in 2024, led by Latin America and driven by global demand for new and differentiated products. New crop protection product volume is expected to be up high single-digits, driving incremental organic revenue. Additionally, we'll benefit from Spinosyns' capacity expansion as we expect high single-digit growth from the Spinosyns franchise. 2024 will be another significant step in our path to royalty neutrality with $100 million improvement in net royalty expense, with increased benefits in both out-licensing income and royalty expense driven by Enlist E3 penetration. And after two years of high levels of input cost inflation, we expect to see low single-digit deflation in Crop Protection raw material costs. Productivity and cost actions in both Seed and Crop Protection combined with input cost deflation, are expected to add approximately $300 million of benefits. We expect an increase in SG&A spend in 2024, driven by normalized bad debt and compensation accruals. We'll also continue to invest in the future with increased investment in R&D, which is expected to now be approximately 8% of sales. And finally, the Biologicals franchise is expected to add approximately $90 million of operating EBITDA with improved margins in 2024. Regarding the timing of sales and earnings in 2024, we're expecting over 60% of sales and roughly 80% of EBITDA to be delivered in the first half of the year. We also expect to see a timing difference between the first two quarters versus prior year due primarily to the strength of Crop Protection in the first quarter of 2023. You'll recall that Crop Protection's first quarter 2023 was prior to the significant impact of channel inventory destocking. For Seed, we're assuming a normal delivery pattern in the Northern Hemisphere, which could shift significantly between first and second quarter depending on weather conditions. With 2024 guidance in mind, let's go to Slide 11 to review the key drivers of earnings growth in 2024 and 2025. And as Chuck said, we've adjusted the 2025 financial framework based on our actual results for 2023 and the expectation for continued earnings growth and margin expansion in both 2024 and 2025. Now, in 2023, we delivered an incremental $800 million in EBITDA versus 2021. Given the market dynamics in 2023, this was no small feat and clearly differentiates us from our peers. We have a plan to generate an approximate $800 million of additional EBITDA growth by 2025, which translates to low double-digit compound annual growth rate between 2023 and 2025. A number of the drivers of our anticipated performance of about $4.2 billion of EBITDA and 22% margin in 2025 are within our control. We've demonstrated our price for value strategy in Seed and we expect this strategy to continue. Our royalty neutrality strategy delivered more than $200 million in benefits in 2023 alone and is going to add another $100 million per year in both 2024 and 2025. What's even more exciting is that we're starting to see benefits from our out-licensing business as we migrate a greater portion of our portfolio to our own proprietary technology and we expect that to meaningfully grow in the next decade. The rebalance in the Crop Protection industry will take some time. We expect it to be achieved by 2025, but underlying demand and applications at the farm gate remains solid. The differentiated portions of our Crop Protection portfolio, including our new products, together with its Spinosyns franchise and our Biologicals franchise, will continue to outpace market growth in 2024. The differentiation will also protect our business from the most severe elements of pricing competition, which are largely in the non-differentiated portions of the industry. Now, we delivered more than $315 million of combined productivity and cost actions in 2023 across the business. And our plan is to deliver another $200 million per year in both 2024 and 2025, and this does not include an additional improved net royalty or the deflation benefit that we anticipate will grow into 2025. Importantly, we'll also continue to invest more in R&D and our future innovation. With that, let's go to Slide 12 and transition to the setup for 2025 and the assumptions included in the base case as well as what could drive EBITDA to the low and high end of the range. Now, in both 2024 and 2025, we expect low single-digit Seed pricing, driven by demand for yield advantage technology. One of the biggest variables in our assumptions is how much growth we'll see in the Crop Protection business, given the current market imbalance. While on-farm demand remains relatively consistent, we're not assuming a significant rebound in the market. New and differentiated products, including Biologicals, would drive much of the Crop Protection growth in 2024 and 2025, as we move towards differentiation in two-thirds of the Crop Protection portfolio. In 2024, we expect to see modest input cost inflation in Crop Protection with Seed costs relatively flat. By 2025, we expect to see more benefit from cost deflation in both Seed and Crop Protection. Our assumptions include increased SG&A due to normalization of bad debt and compensation accruals as well as increased investment in R&D, as we reach our target of 8% of sales. Together, we have a balanced set of assumptions, which gives us confidence in our ability to grow earnings and margins out to 2025 and beyond in both Seed and Crop Protection. So with that, let's go to Slide 13 and summarize the key takeaways. First, full year operating EBITDA performance for 2023 was in line with expectations, led by the strength of the Seed business and we're able to grow EBITDA by 5%. Self-help levers helped improve operating margin by roughly 115 basis points. And importantly, this is going to continue into 2024 and into 2025. The bottom line is that our guidance for this year and the setup for next year 2025 that we shared with you today reflects continued earnings and margin growth, much of which is in our control. And finally, the significant financial strength and balance sheet flexibility give us confidence in our ability to continue to grow and supports our track record of returning cash to shareholders. And with that, let me turn it back over to Kim. Kim Booth : Thank you, Dave. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning. Could I ask on the Crop Protection business if you could just talk about volume and price in the following manner. From a volume perspective in 2024, could you talk about markets where destocking is still ongoing. How bad are you expecting the volume to be versus markets where you think it's sort of finished? What are you expecting from a volume perspective? And then likewise, on the price side of the equation, can you differentiate at all about how price is performing in destocking markets versus those markets that have made completed or closer to the end of it? Chuck Magro : Yes. Good morning, Vincent, it's Chuck. What I'll do is I'll give you the overview and then Robert can talk about some of the specifics in the market, and we'll try to do this as quickly as we can. Look, if you think about the overall situation, last year was a pretty tough year in global CP. Where we think we are this year is that the CP market, what I'd say broadly speaking, they're still imbalanced but only in a few regions. So Brazil is still a market where we have ample supply. And there are pockets, I would say, in Europe. But the US, the destocking is largely behind us now. And the market is functioning quite normally and I'd say, is healthy. When you look at it globally, the situation that we see for 2024 is that the overall global industry most likely will be down low single digits. And that is, as you rightly called out, it's really a function of price. Volumes seem to be stable and growing, and we expect that in 2024 and then our early look -- so then if you think about this, the first half, I think, is going to be fairly tough in CP. Things should normalize and stabilize in the second half of the year, and this is a broad statement globally. And then as we look to 2025, we believe that 2025 will look more like the historical CP industry. So low single-digit, return to normal growth is how we're sizing up 2025. And then that growth will be off of a new lower base. So that's the setup for 2024 and a first look at 2025. Robert, do you want to just talk specifically around markets? Robert King : Add a little bit of color around markets and some of our product groups. Start with, as Chuck talked about, the industry being down overall, but growth in volume, and we will reflect that as you think about walk around the world with our regions that by and large, we're up everywhere on volume. Price will continue to be a competitive market in all of our regions, specifically in Brazil, where destocking, as you pointed out, still needs to take place. We'll be watching to see how the rest of the season works out to see, how are we positioned for that 2024-2025 season there. But as you look at our portfolio, we're able to really begin to use or leverage our differentiated portfolio, the new products and Biologicals. And as you'll have seen in 2023, new and differentiated products were up 5% on pricing with a market that was in very much a headwind of price. And so we expect that those products, the new products, Spinosyns, Biologicals are all going to see upward gains in price and volume over this next year. Specifically in our Biologicals, when you think about the acquisition and the pricing that, that part of the portfolio uses, our EBITDA actually is going to be up 2x on a year-over-year basis with Biologicals as you look at the second year of the integration of the acquisitions and coming to full fruition there. So we're working for great things out of those three areas of our portfolio. And then specific to pricing, we will continue to follow the strategy that we had of price for value. Yeah, it's competitive. There's always going to be a price volume pull, but like I said, when you think about our portfolio of new differentiated and Biologicals making up nearly a majority of our entire earnings, we think we're in a pretty good position to be able to price through this as we continue to work through the year. Operator : I'll go next to David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Chuck, on your 2024 and 2025 guidance, you're expecting the midpoint EBITDA of $200 million in 2024, but up $550 million in 2025. Can you discuss why the accelerated growth in 2025 versus 2024 on EBITDA? Thank you. Chuck Magro : Yeah. Good morning, David, and Dave can give me some perspective as well here. But if you start thinking about the situation, just the way we've looked at the market, the Seed market remains very healthy, and we've talked about sort of on-farm demand for top technical and Seed, but also for CP being very stable and very steady. So that is the backdrop, and then when you consider the fact that you've got the CP industry and if you take the comments we've just made, where we still have some destocking in 2024, that's going to impact our business. And that's reflective in how we've set up the guide and then where we believe we can hit in 2025 is really the impact of having that global CP market stabilize and then start to go again in 2025. And then there's this large bucket of sort of value creation, which is, we call it, controlling our controllables, it's self-help, it's cost, it's productivity, it's the royalties that we've seen improvement in expenses in our out-licensing royalty growing. If you think about that, in 2023, that number was approaching -- well, it was over $500 million. And we're going to see now going forward in 2024 and again, in 2025, somewhere between $350 million and $450 million of sort of self-help controllables, and that has some deflation. But that's really -- one of the big issues here is we're starting to see deflation move through our P&L, primarily now in CP. And because of how we manage risk management and hedging in our Seed business, there's going to be even more benefit as we get into 2025. So to your specific question, some of it has to do with just the rate and the timing of seeing some of the deflation come through the P&L. And then there are some accounting normalizations, Dave, that you should hit. Dave Anderson : Yeah. I think the other key thing, David, related to this, is in 2024, we've got some assumed headwinds and really known headwinds. We've got those, particularly in SG&A as we lap 2023 where we had benefits of lower incentive compensation accrual, we've also got increased in our assumption in terms of merit and then there's just a number of other sort of discrete items that affect 2024. And as a result, 2025, when you look at 2025 compared to 2024, you won't have those same increments facing us. So that provides some of the lift as well in addition to the controlling the controllables that Chuck referenced. Chuck Magro : Yeah. And maybe one last point here, David. If you think about the last two years, Corteva actually grew by about $800 million of EBITDA. That's the same plan for 2024 and 2025, a little less in 2024, more in 2025, but we saw that in 2022 and then a little less in 2023. So it should give -- at least when we look at it, it gives us some comfort that this path that we're on to 2025 with the adjustments we've made, and by the way, we did not adjust the margin. We're feeling very comfortable about that. We feel we are on the right path here. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Joel Jackson : Hi. Good morning, everyone. I want to go back to slide 10, which is the 2023 operating EBITDA bridge. So looking at the bridge, looking at the drivers, the tax over hand side, the cost component we're talking a lot about controllables and costs but actually, your bridge is showing that net-net costs are not driving any of your growth and even earnings in 2010. So you've got all these cost benefits, cost programs, lower seed royalties paying out to also have I -- guess, higher cost in SG&A and R&D. Can you explain that a bit and trying to put this all together why net-net high level, you're showing cost is not driving growth, but as far as your talking points on the right-hand side? Dave Anderson : Yeah. It's a really, really good question, Joel. It really plays into the response that I gave to the prior question. But let me give you a little bit more color. Number one, the cost benefits, we think, are really very much there. We're going to get in CP manufacturing as well as overall productivity between both businesses. We've got an important contribution coming through. So, probably, let's call it, around $250 million of benefit of goodness, another $100 million in terms of net royalties. Now offsetting that, we've got higher R&D. And I'm talking now just the cost lines, some of the benefits and some of the self-help shows up in price or volume. But just on the cost piece of the walk, which is reflected in the slide that you're referencing. So, $100 million of R&D and then over $200 million in SG&A. And that SG&A, again, is made up of merit incentive comp accrual. We've got some additional bad debt. As you know, we begin each year with a normalized accrual in terms of bad debt. That's about $40 million. And then we've got other items, including the annualization of the SG&A for the Biologicals business. And that's against the backdrop of what Robert referenced in terms of the significant increase in EBITDA that we believe will experience and deliver in 2024. And then we just have a lot of other things that comprise the tail. One of those prominently, which you would recognize is ERP in 2023 with our Latin America deployment, which is our last major deployment in the ERP sector having completed U.S. and Europe. We're now in Latin America. That will shift from capital in 2023 to expense in 2024. That's about $40 million. So when you add it all up, that's why the line shows optically what it is. So, significant self-help, some of that is outside the cost area, shows up in price and volume. That shows up in costs. We've got some headwinds as well. But importantly, and I referenced this in the earlier question, that if you will, increase for 2024, it becomes significantly less. In fact, that increase goes away for 2025. So looking at that lift, that's part of the lift from 2024 to 2025. I hope that helps. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you and good morning. My question relates to your direct input costs for each segment. In Crop Protection, it seems to me that maybe you're baking in for 2024, about $100 million of raw material cost relief or 2% to 3%. Is that fair? And then on the Seed side of the equation, are you anticipating any cost relief in 2024, given the decline in commodity prices? Or is it really more of a benefit to you in 2025? Maybe you could speak to that flow through would be helpful. Dave Anderson : Kevin, sure. So in Crop Protection, as we indicated, the anticipated benefit we're going to see on the direct material side. In terms of looking at really, call it, the addressable spend and the opportunity for improvement and what we're experiencing in the second half of this year. So that low single digits, I think is an appropriate kind of range to be thinking about for 2024. On the Seed side, as you know, what you have is you have a delay when you look at spot or commodity costs in the market versus what shows up in the P&L. It's associated with as Chuck said, and as you know, the commodity hedging strategy that we utilize. So for 2024, very important percentage of those costs in terms of that commodity cost is actually related to grower compensation and procurement activity that occurs in 2022 and 2023. The other part of it is the FIFO accounting, which also influences the numbers on the Seed side. There's a lot of other variables besides commodity costs. But as Chuck said, we don't anticipate -- aren't currently planned, haven't baked into our guidance, a meaningful change in terms of year-over-year cost of goods sold for the Seed business. Operator : Thank you. We'll go to Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Q \u2013 Frank Mitsch : Thanks so much. I want to focus in on Latin America. Obviously, you had weather impacts, which you had kind of foreshadowed in the last conference call. I'm curious as to what you thought that might overall impact have been? And then just staying with that region, obviously, you're expecting destocking to continue into the early part of the year, but you also referenced market dynamics in CPC which I assume I was referring to generic competition. I'm wondering what -- if you could provide an update on what you're seeing there in terms of the generic impact in Brazil in particular? Thank you. Chuck Magro : Good morning, Frank, so yes, let me give you the high level and then I think it would be instructive if Tim, gives you a situation that's happening in Seed and then if Robert has anything to add in CP. but look, you're right. So -- and I'll just zero in, Latin America is a big diverse region for us. But really, this is a Brazil phenomenon. And if you look at 2023, I'd call it the perfect storm, right? We had CP destocking was probably the most pronounced in that country. It was hit with pretty severe weather challenges, which actually slowed down the destocking and certainly has impacted planted acreage of the safrinha crop. And then you've got all the kind of macroeconomic conditions on top of that. So it is going to take some time to sort out. We do see that we are heading in the right direction. The positive, I think, comment I can make is the long-term trends in Brazil, the structural opportunity that we see in that country has not changed. This will be an ag growth market for the future. But there's been some moving parts in Seed and CP, and I'll turn it over to Tim now to talk about Seed. Tim Glenn : Yes. Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, Frank. So yes, I mean, you go back to kind of the backdrop heading into the season, we saw a pretty significant rapid decline in the commodity prices that was a result of the big yields and the resulting high carryover stocks from the last safrinha season. And then when you couple that with the, I would describe as highly variable weather conditions that really delayed the start of the soy planting season in the key markets across the marketplace in Brazil. And in some cases, that was drought or lack of moisture early on or in some places, it was excessive moisture as you went further into the South. And what it ended up doing was pushing a significant share of the soy into later planning window that really impacts the ability of the farmer to follow up with a corn crop that falls into an ideal planting window. So as you said, we talked about that in November, and we were sort of at that call it at that critical point when we needed to get that crop planted. And my best guess is somewhere around 20%, 25% of the corn -- or excuse me, of the soybeans were planted in a window that was not ideal for following up with corn. And I'm not going to try to peg how much corn won't be planted at this point in time. I spent a lot of time in the marketplace over the last three months, traveling across the major safrinha growing areas, discussions with customers and channel partners and certainly, a lot of feedback from our frontline commercial team there. But as we sit here today, we believe it will be somewhere, call it, a double-digit reduction in terms of the area that's planted to corn for both the safrinha and the summer season that has already been planted. That being said, farmers are still planting corn hectares where the timing works out. And last week, I was in Brazil, and I saw it firsthand where they were harvesting beans and coming right in with corn. So, the momentum is still there for corn and a lot of support even with the reduced commodity price. And our expectation is, as Chuck just said, that we're going to see something more back to a typical level of corn planting as we go into next year, where I think of something on the order of the safrinha hectares for 2022 and 2023 being a reasonable target for the 2024-2025 crop that will be important in the second half of next year. Corn remains a profitable crop. Demand for rain in Brazil is still growing. And so that's very important. And the other thing that we've seen is that there's a real strong agronomic reason to plant corn and the soy that is being harvested right now that followed corn from last year is performing better than those that were not on rotated acres from corn. So, we're still very optimistic and the fundamentals remain strong, but it is a really challenging safrinha season in Brazil. So, I'll pass it over to Robert for CP. Robert King : Yes, Frank, when we began to look at or unpack a little bit more of Brazil, what's going on there, I think it's fundamental to reflect on what Chuck said. Brazil will get back to growth. It's just going to take a little bit of time. From looking at 2024, this destocking is going to last a little bit longer. We need to work through the first part of the year to have a little better view. But overall, this next year, we see the industry down in low single-digits overall, but we expect to be up modestly, primarily due to further penetration of our new products, the differentiated products, and then adding in Biologicals there. Specific to your question, though, around generics and the pressure there of pricing and competitive environment. Off-patent and generics have always been part of this market overall in the global market. It is a little bit stronger in Latin America and in Asia, but we've not seen any further pricing degradation coming out of the generic manufacturers. Production capacity, we've not seen any significant changes there either. However, there have been some plants built of late that are focusing on big molecules that are coming off patent in the next few years that will play a factor there, none of which are any of our molecules. In the last half of 2023, Brazil imports began to slow overall. And we continue to see that the generic profits are struggling in this low pricing environment. So, we expect that there will be some changes there as we walk through this year and next year. Specific to the pricing pressure, yes, it is exasperated a little bit in Brazil due to the former profit environment and the macroeconomic factors that Chuck mentioned there earlier. What this does is farmers begin to look at what are the next best alternative to save on the input cost. But our strategy that focus on the higher value, the differentiated products and the higher service is one that we think is still a winning combination. These high-technology products and high-quality agronomic service being excellent in these areas is things that will differentiate us from the competition. And we think we're in a pretty good position as we head into 2024 and then 2025 with our strategy in those areas. So thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Steve Byrne : Yes, thank you. I assume your Seed order book for North America is full at this point. And just wanted to ask your view on within that, how much of an increase in Enlist are you expecting as a percent of soybeans for 2024? And can you partition that $100 million reduction in net royalty into the buckets. How much of it is trade fee versus germplasm fee, both out-licensing and in-licensing. Those are four buckets there. And can you split that $100 million, and do you see any risk of Seed pricing going into the spring with potential competitive actions? Tim Glenn : All right, Steve. Hey, good morning. I'll take a shot at all those. It's -- we're going little bit of time on North America Seed here. So I'd say where we're at right now, you touched on it. I mean, we've been live in the market since August 1st, and we spend that August-December window, working closely with customers, building proposals and securing commitments, and we feel very good about where our order book sits today. And I'd say pattern -- order pattern in terms of timing was consistent with past experiences and our expectations, and we're not seeing any change in terms of the mix of technology. And so that feels like a good spot rate there. In terms of the question on pricing, it's always a competitive marketplace. And I'd say this year, I'd say soybeans are probably a little bit more competitive than maybe on the corn side and a lot of hooks battling for the spots there. But as we sit here today, and we're roughly 70 days out from the planting window opening in the heart of the corn belt. Our prices are holding and we feel good about where we sit there. Customers understand the value proposition, and our team is focused on staying close and executing our plan. And so you never know what's going to happen, as I said, 70 days until the season really breaks here. But I think we're in a positive spot in terms of, call it, the stability around price. When you get into E3, I'd say where we sit today, order position is tracking as expected and our best estimate in terms of the market right now is about 60%. We see the soy market at about 60% converted to E3 this year. And again, remember, we don't have full visibility to our licensees and there's over 100 other companies that are selling Enlist E3 soybeans. And so we don't have perfect visibility there, but I think that 60% level is confident. So no surprises and things are tracking as expected. In terms of that royalty bucket, I'd say this year, and I don't know if I can split it into four, I probably won't try to. But the majority of the benefit that we're getting this year would be from reduced payment of royalties, primarily in soybeans. So that's the -- think of that as the primary bucket. I think as maybe Chuck had said earlier in his comments, we're going to see that transition, especially beginning in 2025 and beyond where royalties and the benefit from royalties will be greater than what the benefit is from reduction of royalties paid. So a pretty significant -- that will be a significant milestone as we transition there. So I think I touched on all your points there. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping to maybe just get a little bit more color on the free cash flow outlook, both the out performance in the fourth quarter as well as kind of the cadence in 2024. How do we think about the normalization in crop protection production, which will -- should your payables balance increase? How -- just how is that working capital kind of inflection maybe work through the year and any differences you would call out in working capital trends between Seed and Crop Protection because, obviously, there's very divergent trends happening in those two businesses? Dave Anderson : Sure, Adam. This is Dave. So as you know, in 2023, we benefited. We had a strong finish, particularly in receivables and also advanced payments, which, by the way, really underscores the health of the US farmer in terms of income as well as their liquidity. So we had strength in terms of collections, which really enabled us to achieve that round number of $1.2 billion in terms of cash flow for 2023. For 2024, what our guide includes is continued progress in working capital. Notably, though, the mix is going to be a little different. We had accounts receivable in terms of the change of change and the same with inventories were positive in 2023 and significant payables was a use net for the reason you cited in terms of just the reduced procurement, particularly in the Crop Protection side related to managing inventories. For 2024, we're going to see receivables and payables, both being again, change of the change, being contributors in terms of cash and receivables is going to go the other way. We've got a little moderation assumed in terms of the cash to credit ratio for the collections at year-end. And we've got just with some of the market conditions we think DSO is going to go up on a year-over-year basis, modestly still very healthy on a year-over-year basis. But that's essentially, that mix shift in working capital, but an overall theme is overall continued benefit from working capital in terms of cash contribution in 2024. So we're excited to be at near 50% conversion in terms of the guide that we're giving you, precise numbers more like 49%, but round numbers, 50% conversion cash flow to EBITDA for 2024. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next to Aleksey Yefremov form KeyBanc Capital Markets. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Last quarter, you discussed an influx of generic crop protection imports into Latin America. Has situation changed at all in -- over the fourth quarter? Chuck Magro : Yes. So I think Robert covered some of this already. Good morning. I'd say, look, what we saw in the third quarter was elevated imports from broadly speaking, from generics entering Latin America. What we've seen since then as we work our way through the fourth quarter and then so far in 2024, is that, generally speaking, imports into Latin America are down and they're trending -- they're slowing down, they're trending down, and that includes generics. So I think we commented that what we're seeing at a price level is that we didn't expect that what we saw at, I'll call it, the peak was sustainable. And that's exactly what we think is happening here is there is a rebalancing happening, I think there's kind of a view of that you need to be profitable when you're moving these products around the world and into these regions. And so that's exactly what we saw is a slowdown. But I will counsel -- generics a part of this market. They're not going away. They serve a role, but it's not the primary area. In fact, we've made portfolio decisions to move almost our entire portfolio away from these product lines, because we feel that where we want to add value is differentiated technology service with strong agronomic support, because I think that's what farmers need and they're willing to pay for that. But to answer your direct question, yes, we've seen a slowdown in imports into Brazil, including generics. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our last question from Josh Spector with UBS. Josh Spector : Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one, if I could ask on, you didn't talk about a shift from corn to soy as being a negative in your EBITDA bridge. Just given where you're at from a profitability in soy and a higher and less share, is that a meaningful factor as you look at acres shifting between corn and soy or is that more neutral? What's the sensitivity we should be looking at? Thanks. Tim Glenn : Hey, Josh, good morning. I'll take a shot at this. So yes, I mean, I don't think it's any secret that corn is always more profitable for us than soy in North America. I think what's changing is that first, we anticipated this. This isn't a shock. And so we've been planning for this, and it's baked into our numbers right now. And I think the other important part is it's still -- there still is a difference, but the difference isn't quite as great as it had been. And the reason is today, because we're not dependent on somebody else's technology on soybeans. So soy relative to where we would have been three, four, five years ago is much more profitable. So there is still a difference there. We factored it in, but it's not quite the difference we would have had prior to the significant shift Enlist E3 within our business. Operator : Thank you. And I'll turn it back over to Kim for any additional or closing remarks. Kim Booth : Great. And that concludes today's call. We thank you for joining and for your interest in Corteva. And we hope you have a safe and wonderful day. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Corteva Agriscience's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Kim Booth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kimberly Booth : Good morning, and welcome to Corteva's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Chuck Magro, Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Anderson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Tim Glenn, Executive Vice President, Seed Business Unit; and Robert King, Executive Vice President, Crop Protection business unit, will join the Q&A session. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks during this call, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of the Corteva website and through the link to our webcast.  During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are our expectations about the future. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could materially differ from these statements due to these risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, discussed on this call and in the Risk Factors section of our reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.  Please note in today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release and related schedules, along with our supplemental financial summary slide deck available on our Investor Relations website. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Chuck. Charles Magro : Thanks, Kim. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making executing our strategic plan including items such as the Enlist technology, biologicals, increased investment in strategic innovation and our productivity and cost actions. Today's focus will be on our first quarter performance, and also some insights into how we see the rest of the first half and year unfold. Let me start with the bottom line. While the crop is not yet fully planted in North America, 2024 is playing out mostly as we expected. And so we are reaffirming our full year guidance, which we announced in early February and remain on track to meet our 2025 financial framework. Globally, from an industry perspective, we have relatively constructive fundamentals. We continue to see record-setting demand for grain, oilseeds, feed and biofuels. In order to meet this growing demand, farmers are investing in premium seed and crop protection technologies to enhance and protect yield. Our Seed business is having a very good start to the year. Organic sales are up 5% and price is up 6%, reflecting the value technology consistently delivers to farmers. Our Seed order book reflects strong demand for our product lineup. We are planning to bring about 500 new products to the market this year with approximately 300 new seed hybrids and varieties. Factored into our guidance for the year is the fact that farmers in the U.S. are projected to shift planted area from corn to soybeans, resulting in a projected increase in soybean area of about 3.5%. If current trends hold, about 60% of all U.S. soybean acres will be planted with our Enlist technology in 2024, quite an impressive feat in less than 5 years where we continue to be the #1 selling soybean technology in the U.S. On the Crop Protection side, ample supply and residual effects of destocking are creating a more competitive environment. This is coupled with farmers making their purchases much closer to the application window resulting in a delay in volumes. But all signs point to volume growth in the second half, particularly in Latin America, as the channel inventory imbalance in remaining regions is expected to stabilize. At a high level, our Crop Protection business has made significant performance improvement since 2021. By the end of 2024, we anticipate that we will have added $1 billion of new products in biological sales, exited $500 million of lower-margin products and improved EBITDA margin by about 200 basis points in that 3-year time frame. Our differentiated Crop Protection portfolio will continue to create new pathways to value creation and this has been strengthened by our industry-leading biological business. As a result of targeted portfolio actions and strategic investments in fast growth market segments, our portfolio differentiation mix has grown from about 50% to an estimated 60% in 2024. We also continue to execute on the optimization of our global crop protection asset footprint, where we are estimating annual run rate savings of $100 million by 2025. As I said, we expect the crop protection industry to return to volume growth in the second half. Mix enrichment driven by our new products and biologicals as well as the cost actions I mentioned will drive margin improvement in our Crop Protection business in 2024.  A final point on controlling the controllables. In 2024 and again in 2025, we're still expecting to see between $350 million and $450 million of benefits from our self-help levers. These actions continue to drive value creation for the company and are providing margin enhancement throughout the ag cycle. Finally, I'd like to note that in about a month, Corteva turns 5. We'll be celebrating not only our fifth anniversary but also the impact we've had on farms around the world over that time and the value that impact has created for farmers, for shareholders and for the world at large. It's been a remarkable journey, in which we rolled out more than 1,500 new and next-generation products and technology to our 10 million global customers. I'm proud to say that together with our 23,000 employees, we've built one of the most competitively advantaged agricultural technology portfolios in the industry, and we remain optimistic about the future of agriculture and the future of Corteva.  And with that, let me turn the call over to Dave. David Anderson : Thanks, Chuck, and welcome, everyone, to the call. Let's start on Slide 5, which provides the financial results for the quarter. As Chuck said and you can see from the numbers, the results for the quarter were largely in line with expectations with both sales and operating EBITDA down from prior year. Organic sales were down 6% compared to last year with Seed growth offset by Crop Protection. Seed volume gains in the first quarter in North America were offset by Seed volume declines in all other regions. And as expected, Crop Protection volumes were down double digits against a strong first quarter of 2023 comparison. We're obviously pleased to report another first quarter with more than $1 billion of operating EBITDA, in part due to benefits from improved net royalty expense and productivity savings. However, operating EBITDA was down 16% compared to prior year, and EBITDA margin for the quarter was 23% or down approximately 200 basis points versus prior year with margin expansion in Seed offset by Crop Protection headwinds. Let's go to Slide 6 and review sales by segment. Seed net sales were up 2% to nearly $2.8 billion. Organic sales were up 5% on broad-based pricing gains as we continue to price for value. And global Seed pricing was up 6% with gains in every region and across the portfolio.  Seed volumes were down 1% versus prior year. Gains in North America driven by mild weather and strong execution were offset by declines in other regions. Notably, volumes in EMEA were down due to delays in demand associated with unfavorable weather. Crop Protection net sales were down 20% in the quarter versus a strong first quarter in 2023. The sales decline was driven by residual impacts of destocking in EMEA and Latin America and the shift to just-in-time purchasing in North America, pushing sales out closer to the application window, which is largely in the second quarter. Crop Protection volumes were down 18% in the quarter, including the impact of strategic product exits. Pricing was down 3% compared to prior year, driven by competitive pressures and tight channel inventory management. Crop Protection pricing in EMEA was up 4%, largely in response to currency impacts. Slide 7 illustrates the significance of the last week of March for seed deliveries in the U.S. With mild weather in much of the United States during March, pioneer seed deliveries tracked ahead of prior year, putting 2024 closer in line to the first quarter of 2021 and 2022, which we would consider a normal delivery pattern versus last year's delays. The favorable product mix, coupled with seasonal price increases translated to a strong Seed operating EBITDA margin for the quarter, approximately 300 basis points above last year. With that, let's go to Slide 8 for a summary of first quarter operating performance. For the quarter, operating EBITDA was down approximately $200 million to just over $1 billion, again, largely in line with expectations. Pricing gains, coupled with improvement in net royalties and productivity actions were offset by volume declines and cost and currency headwinds. The $22 million of cost headwinds in the quarter was related to higher Seed commodity costs and modest Crop Protection inflation on input costs reflecting the sell-through of higher cost inventory. Importantly, based on raw material purchases, we still expect to deliver approximately $100 million of savings for full year 2024 from Crop Protection input cost deflation. SG&A for the quarter was up approximately 1%, primarily from a full quarter of G&A from the biologicals acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A was down more than 2% versus prior year as we maintain disciplined spending. With that, let's go to Slide 9 and transition to the setup for the remainder of the year. I want to share the key assumptions for the first half and second half of 2024. We expect sales for the first half to be down low single digits with EBITDA flat to slightly down versus last year. Seed is expected to continue the momentum from first quarter and deliver solid growth in the first half of the year, led by North America on a strong product lineup. Crop Protection will continue to experience impacts from the shift to just-in-time demand and residual destocking and will likely be down in the first half of '24 compared to the prior year. Both Seed and Crop Protection are expected to experience cost headwinds through the first half of the year related to higher Seed commodity costs and Crop Protection input costs. These market-driven cost headwinds will be partially offset by benefits related to reduced net royalty expense and also productivity actions. SG&A and R&D investment are both expected to modestly increase in the first half of '24 compared to last year. Now turning to the right side of Slide 9 regarding the second half of the year. We expect double-digit sales and EBITDA growth, driven primarily by Crop Protection, partly as a result of the comparison to 2023 second half where volume and price combined were down 16% from 2022. In Seed, we expect a rebound in Brazil safrinha corn area after a reduction in the 2023, '24 season due mostly to weather. We expect Seed results in the second half to be in line with historical pattern, meaning likely a small EBITDA loss in the second half. Crop Protection volume gains will drive much of the growth in the second half with pricing expected to remain challenged. We expect Crop Protection volume growth in the second half to be enabled by some market stabilization in Latin America. Our base case assumption is for a volume uptick year-over-year in Brazil, led by new products, spinosyns and biologicals. And available data suggests channel inventories are trending down in Brazil. While they're still higher than historical average, inventory levels have come down versus 2023 year-end. So the channel is making progress towards a more normalized inventory level. And the demand at the farm gate in Brazil remains healthy, and the expected increase in planted area supports additional Crop Protection applications. So the second half outlook for biologicals growth is largely driven by Stoller, which has a strong market position in Brazil. We expect to see input cost deflation in Crop Protection during the second half of the year. Coupled with productivity and cost actions including benefits from the footprint optimization project, we anticipate a cost tailwind for crop protection.  And as a reminder, we expect an increase in SG&A spend in 2024, driven by normalized bad debt and compensation accruals. We also continue to increase the investment in R&D. So the balance of improved market conditions and continued execution on controllables will drive second half growth. Together with the roughly flat first half and double-digit second half EBITDA growth, we remain on track for full year 2024 operating EBITDA guidance in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, but the path will be a little different than our original assumptions.  Specifically, in addition to more volume growth, we now expect total company pricing to be slightly down for the year with Crop Protection pricing more than offsetting the low single-digit price gains in Seed. And while we're expecting total cost to be marginally higher for the year, an increase from our original assumption, we remain on track to deliver savings on our controllables, $100 million reduction in net royalty expense, $100 million in Crop Protection input cost deflation and $200 million from productivity and cost actions. So let's now go to Slide 10 and summarize the key takeaways. First, operating EBITDA performance for the first quarter was in line with expectations, led by the strength of the Seed business. And while first quarter 2024 results were down versus prior year, we remain on track to deliver our full year 2024 guidance, including sales and earnings growth. And after our standout performance in 2023, the Seed business momentum continues in the first half of 2024, driven by pricing for technology and continued reduction of net royalty expense. Looking forward to the second half of the year, Crop Protection cost actions and some market improvement will drive much of the growth. And finally, the strong first quarter cash flow result supports our ability to deliver at the midpoint of our free cash flow guidance of $1.75 billion or approximately 50% conversion. And with that, let me turn it over to Kim with an announcement about a significant upcoming event. Kim? Kimberly Booth : Thanks, Dave. We're excited to announce that our 2024 Investor Day will be held on November 19 in New York City. The management team will provide updates on the company's strategy and financial targets, along with highlights showcasing our innovation and pipeline. We look forward to seeing many of you at this event in November. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Chuck and Dave, thanks for all the updates on the first quarter. Could you help us just understand your confidence and the line of sight you have in sort of bridging the first quarter to the second quarter to make that half. Clearly, the Seed order book, you've got a good line of sight on, but maybe talk a little bit more about your confidence on the Crop Protection side. Charles Magro : So let me start. I'll give you the backdrop and then Dave can help you with the bridging. So first of all, let me say that we're still feeling good about the ag economy. We've got record demand. On-farm demand looks very steady and healthy and generally speaking, and this is a broad statement, farmers are still making money. We're -- they're off their peaks, of course. But this is a pretty healthy macroeconomic environment for them to be operating in. I'd say the other thing that is trending well for us is we're feeling quite good about what we call controlling the controllables. So this notion, last year, if you recall, 2023, we removed about $500 million from self-help in terms of cost reduction, productivity improvements, royalty improvements. So this year, we're targeting $350 million to $450 million. And a lot of that is coming together quite nicely. And then if you just look at the Seed business, it's having a very strong year, especially what I'd say out of North America and the business continues to grow organically, and I think that's quite important as we bring in new technology and that technology, of course, is being -- had quite a high uptake on the farm. So I think given that backdrop, when we look at it, we felt it was important to look at the full year, first of all, and we think the year is unfolding pretty much as we expected. So the $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion would hold. And then looking even past 2024 into 2025, the value creation framework we laid out, we still feel very comfortable about that. Dave, do you want to now talk a little bit about the quarter 1, quarter 2 and the bridging? David Anderson : Sure. So it's really a continuation of some of the themes that we talked about for the first quarter, including the strong North America seed despite the anticipation, obviously, of reduced corn acres. But that's going to continue to be very positive. We're going to see the flow-through and the benefit of that in terms of first half results. There's some improvement that's anticipated in the Crop Protection business, but we're still, as I mentioned, I think, in the prepared remarks, expecting crop to be down both revenue and EBITDA on a year-over-year basis. So we're going to finish -- second quarter is going to be an improvement in the trend line on Crop Protection in terms of the variance from prior year, but not enough to offset that first quarter, so the first half will have -- will be down in that segment on a year-over-year basis.  As you know, we've got only modest improvement included and expected for the biologicals business, that's really going to be much more significant in the second half. The other thing is in terms of the benefit of cost deflation and particularly on the Crop Protection side, as you know, that's really weighted to the second half as well. So the bridge, if you will, to the first half is really, for the most part, a continuation of the themes that we experienced in the first quarter. And then the second half, it really becomes much more of a volume story for both Seed and Crop in much more of the productivity and the live-through, if you will, of the deflation benefit that we anticipate of Crop Protection. So hopefully, that's helpful. And by the way, just as a reminder, just in terms of our overall guide and kind of a restatement for context is that we're anticipating, again, we stated this at the beginning of the year, and we affirm that in our conversation or comments earlier, which is around an 80-20, if you will, split in terms of EBITDA for the first half. So think of that as flat to slightly down for the first half. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Unknown Analyst : This is [indiscernible] here for Dave. Can you just talk about the being dynamic in U.S. soybeans this year and how competitive it is and if you're seeing any pressure? David Anderson : I'll turn that over to Tim. Timothy Glenn : Yes. I mean, my first answer is always the markets are always competitive. So no question about that. And we operate our branded business especially at the high end of the market. We're selling a premium product, top performance. And so I don't know if I'd say it's any more competitive than what it typically is. But soybeans are more so than corn in recent years, competitive, and there's always lower-cost options in the marketplace. So I think our teams have done a very good job of creating demand and filling that order. I think we're, obviously, continuing to be focused on getting paid for the value that we deliver to our customers. And we're fortunate we work with a group of customers who appreciate that value, and we're going to continue to focus on it. But my answer is, it's competitive, it's always competitive. There are always lower-cost alternatives, but farmers are very, very interested in planting high-performing products. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Joel Jackson : Maybe to ask a bit of a strategy question on seeds. So we're all aware of what's going on with dicamba in the U.S. or -- you're obviously a seed player who produces seed with the different trades, your own, Enlist variations and Xtend variations and Flex. What strategically do you hear? What is your view on what will happen to dicamba for 2025 and for the rest of the year? How does that affect your own seed-growing strategy now when you are contracting out Seed growth this year. Are you going to increase your usual set of seeds, so you have different variations across the tenant list? Or are you going to -- maybe talk about what you do in this uncertainty. Charles Magro : Let me give you the overall context from a Seed strategy and then Tim can answer the question on sort of the current dynamics and what we're finding from an order book perspective. So we said it already a couple of times today. I think we're very pleased with the Seed performance and we are expecting growth again in '24 in margin expansion. And it's really coming down, I think, for us. We have shifted our strategy, and it's been a long investment over some time. But when you're launching 300 new seed hybrid and varieties almost every year, and we're able to price for that value that farmers are seeing in terms of productivity and yield and disease resistance, insect resistance, I think that's the best of all worlds for all the players here. So our strategy, simply put, we've moved away from being sort of a net technology purchaser to a net technology seller.  And the out-licensing is still small in terms of revenue, but it is ramping up. And Enlist would be our first sort of franchise that we're really getting momentum there, and we've got lots of partners that are buying that technology now. Canola and corn are ramping up nicely, and we like that overall Seed strategy. And we've communicated that even this year, we're expecting another $100 million of net benefits in terms of lower net royalties, and this is that journey to neutrality that we said we would be on towards the end of the decade. I'll turn it over to Tim now. But just one last comment. We really haven't seen lower costs flow through the Seed business yet. And we said that, that wouldn't happen until most likely in 2025. We're still on plan for that. So you've got this wonderful business that is selling technology, but eventually, you're going to see some lower COGS as well as that works through our hedges and how we kind of manage the cost of product we have to in '25 and in '26. So there's some new and exciting things that will come and we'll talk more about that at our Investor Day in September. But Tim, maybe the current order book and the dynamics you're sensing in the marketplace. Timothy Glenn : Yes. I mean, it's certainly one of the things that we've been looking at closely for the last several months as the questions around what the future of dicamba label looks like. So again, just to reiterate this year, I'd say that the decision had a very minimal impact on what was planted this year. So in terms of the commercial crop that farmers are planting, by and large, when the decision was made on the dicamba label seed was purchased, it was probably paid for. And I think the market felt like that there was an adequate supply of dicamba in the channel for those who want to spray.  Going into next year, clearly, it's some big questions to answer there. First thing I'd say is it is still too early to speculate on how the market fully plays out given the uncertainty of whether dicamba has a label or if they do what it looks like in terms of over-the-top applications on the soybeans. So we've stayed close to our customers and tried to gauge what their impacted -- or what their thoughts are there. For those customers who were still planting Xtend soybeans and in that camp of technology, I'd say that they kind of fell into 3 places. There were some who are saying, \"I'm done. I'm ready to switch.\" And I would anticipate that part of the market is going to -- will shift to Enlist as we go into next year. There are some who are going to stick with it in anticipation that there will be opportunity to use dicamba in the future and they're satisfied with the products and want to stay there. And I'd say the majority of farmers are probably stepping back and looking at the situation and playing a wait and see. They're months away from having to make a decision on seed purchases. And so they're going to wait and see what that looks like -- what that field looks like going forward. In terms of what it meant for our decisions on seed planting, as we plant our seed crop right now, we always plant with the opportunity for some upside on demand, never quite certain how the weather is going to play out and impact your supply.  So I would say we've taken an approach where we will have upside on our B-Series and A-Series products if the demand is there going forward. So we're positioned well for that. And you got to remember that there's over 100 licensees who have access to the technology, very supportive. And no doubt, collectively, I would say that as seed producers, we've all taken a position where I would expect that there will be some upside supply should demand switch. But it's one of those things that we all got to kind of sit back, wait and see. We are obviously staying close to our customers. We will continue to go out there and help them understand the value of our technology. And I think as we get into the seed selling season as we go into, say, September, October, November of next year, farmer is going to be faced with that critical decision based off of what the opportunity for using dicamba and season looks like. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research. Kevin McCarthy : We've been reading in recent weeks about the proliferation of corn stunt disease in Argentina. So I was wondering if you could talk about whether that might have any impact on Corteva either directly through insecticides or indirectly through corn market dynamics. And part of the reason I ask is, when we look at your Crop Protection volume trends by product line, there's quite a wide divergence or was in the quarter. Looking at insecticides, down 5% versus 25% for herbicide. So maybe you could just kind of speak to the breadth of those numbers. Timothy Glenn : Kevin, this is Tim. Let me talk -- let me address it from the seed standpoint first. Obviously, this is an emerging issue and it's I'd say it's rapidly escalated as we've gotten later into the growing season. And it's impacted -- clearly impacted farmers' yields. And I think that's what's being reported today. And we're still in the middle of harvest, so I can't speculate on what the impact is on the grain harvest. I won't even try to go there. Our -- we do have experience with corn stunt. It's the same issue we've dealt with in Brazil for the last several years. I just -- I'd say we know that there's always been presence of leafhoppers in Argentina, so it's never materialized where it became a commercial issue. And so from this year's standpoint, I would say we're good from a seed production standpoint. Our seed crop was not impacted by corn stunt, but clearly, some farmers were. And so we're going to continue to work with our customers. We are in the field right now, working closely as farmers harvest the to crop. Obviously, we're going to have to continue to work with them as they go and make their next season's decisions. The planting window in Argentina is pretty wide. You can have early planted corn, say, in September, all the way through the end of the calendar year. And so farmers have to evaluate what this means for their operations and whether they will plant the same level of corn as they do last year.  Roughly speaking, Argentina is 8 million hectares of corn. It's very important. 70% of that goes into the export market, more or less and so -- yes, I think the risk from a seed standpoint is how many hectors of corn do they plant as they get into that window, say, late third quarter and into the fourth quarter. And I would anticipate that farmers are going to kind of sit back and wait and see what the populations of the leafhoppers are and evaluate what that environment is as they get closer to making those decisions. And so I'm going to pass it to Robert to talk about the impact on the insecticide portfolio. Robert King : Thanks, Tim. The herbicide stores, you got to start with, our portfolio has shifted over this time, the exit of several molecules, glyphosate being one of those. The second thing around that is Q1 2023 was a record herbicide quarter for our company. Couple that with two things. North America is really a timing. Enlist continues to be in really high demand. It will be up for the full year. Keep in mind, there will also be added acres in soybeans. But it's a very trusted technology by the growers, and it's something that we see that will continue to grow this year. Overall, its volume for the season is in line. Keep in mind, we had a pretty good load in Q4 of last year. So when you track it for a season of the crop, we're in line with where we need to be. So that one [indiscernible] up on timing. In Europe, think about what the weather that's been going on there, specifically in Northern Europe. So we're behind on some applications for serial herbicides. And that's something that we think will work out through the year. But there's also a few acres short of wheat that was planted there this year as well. You roll that together and it begins to tell the story that we're really in a good place for herbicides as we look at it on the crop year, and we expect everything to be in line for the full year. And then keep in mind, as you talked about -- you asked about our insecticides in comparison to that. This one is really a testament to the Spinosyns franchise. And the strength that, that technology brings, it continues to perform better than the market. And it's something that the growers are pulling as it's a technology that gives them advantage on the farm. So hopefully, that helps. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : I do love the graphic for the Investor Day. Dave, you indicated that your royalties are expected to be $100 million benefit for 2024. We're over $30 million as we are in 1Q. Should we think about that $100 million being a floor with potential for greater benefits impacting 2024? And then also, I don't recall any comments regarding FX, which was fairly negative in 1Q. If you could offer some thoughts on FX profitability impact for 2Q and beyond, that would be helpful. David Anderson : Sure. Yes. So regarding the first part of your question, in terms of the royalties, those are really weighted to the first half due to North America. So -- and we're on track, Frank, as you said. And I think we stated in our remarks to the $100 million target, which is, by the way, a royalty benefit. So it's an expense reduction as well as income -- royalty income increase on a year-over-year basis.  Regarding the second part of your question regarding foreign exchange, the first quarter was really due to the Turkish lira and we had pricing that mostly offset that impact. So part of what we look at in terms of the pricing on the PVC was really offsetting that currency. We're going to have a small benefit actually in currency anticipated for the second half, and that's part of what's built into our forward guide. Hopefully, that's helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne of Bank of America Securities. Unknown Analyst : Yes. This is [indiscernible] in for Steve. So I wanted to ask a little bit about seed pricing outside of the U.S. And the first part is you had pretty good pricing -- well, price mix. And can you discuss a little bit how much of this was like-for-like price increases versus increase, as you mentioned, for example, in Turkey to offset the FX or just farmers upgrading to new hybrids and varieties? And what is driving this, especially since farmer economics outside of the U.S. are a little bit worse than here, we think. And the second part of the question is, can you let us know how do European seed price is compared to U.S. price currently? And what is, in your view, the upside to pricing once you start marketing genetic products? Charles Magro : Okay. So look, I'll have Tim talk first maybe about our strategy on how we price for value. And then we can talk a little bit about what we're seeing in each of the regions, Tim. Go ahead. Timothy Glenn : Yes. So on the price for value, I mean that's -- we anticipate that -- over time that we're going to be pricing in that low single-digit range based off of the value of the new products that we bring to the market every year. So we plan to have 20%, 25% of our lineup in new genetics that open the door for value share with our customers and gives us that pricing power. And I think I had a little bit of difficulty following the question, but I think you asked about the relative pricing between Europe and North America.  So in Europe, I would say that as Dave mentioned, Turkish lira was one of those inflationary currencies where we had a price to offset currency. And we still would have had low single-digit price increase in Europe, excluding those countries where we've had the price to offset currency devaluation. So there's still positive momentum there. And in terms of absolute pricing differences between the 2 regions, really not comparable because they're completely different products and technology packages. The majority of our products in North America would have some biotechnology associated with it and virtually none in Europe would. So really, it's not an apples-to-apples comparison, but both are priced fairly for value and for their marketplace. So that's how we operate around the world. And I'd say the philosophy is very consistent between the regions, the geographies. It's all about bringing more value to our customers and when we do that, then we have the opportunity to earn a share of that value back through pricing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson of Wolfe Research. Christopher Parkinson : Great. Can you just speak on the latest update on how you're thinking about COGS for both CPC as well as Seed. Obviously, on the latter, you have a few hedges this year. So could we just think about on a preliminary basis, how should we think about that as we progress throughout 2024 and into 2025. And then on the CPC side just given the number of turns of inventory you have on a per annum basis, how we should be thinking about that second half onwards? David Anderson : So maybe I could, Chris, just give you some -- this is Dave, give you some perspective on that. I think, first of all, when you look at our prior guide to this guide, we do have some increase in cost on a year-over-year basis, and that's associated with the Seed business and the assumptions around the second half and particularly safrinha volume, which the anticipation is that we're going to see, call it, recovery -- market recovery there in terms of that volume. And we've got some higher cost inventory that's going to flow through in terms of cost of goods sold. And that's part of just carrying some historic higher production costs, but also it's a transition from older technology to newer technology for that market, which really will set up very, very well for improved costs in the Seed business in that market in 2025 for the '25-'26 season. When you stand back and look overall, we're absolutely on track in terms of productivity for the full year of about $200 million. On the Crop Protection side, in terms of -- and I may have mentioned this earlier, in terms of the cost deflation, in other words ingredient or raw material cost deflation, we anticipate $150 million benefit in the second half. So that will tie to our expectation of $100 million of deflation benefit for the full year. So kind of under the banner of what we call or speak to in terms of controlling the controllables where cost is a very key element of that, we're absolutely on track with the exception of what I mentioned about the Seed business in the second half, where we've got also a fairly significant volume uptick again associated with that market, if you will, improvement in that market recovery assumption we have for safrinha. And for both businesses, what it does is it sets up for additional favorability for 2025. And because we'll see now some of, call it, additional deflation benefit in Crop Protection as well as now some of the commodity cost improvement as well as other cost actions improvement for 2025 and for the Seed business. Again, I hope that helps. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : I was hoping to maybe dig in a little more on the Crop Protection side and some of the pricing dynamics that you're seeing there. And just how much do you think that just reflects some of the deflation in some of the active ingredients on the generic side versus an actual kind of change in the competitive landscape in any of your kind of key product lines? And maybe specifically, in herbicides, for Enlist in the U.S., can you talk to what the attach rate of branded Enlist herbicide is now tracking at to the Enlist acreage that you have in place? And is that -- is the value kind of realization on Crop Protection meeting kind of your own expectations from a couple of years ago as Enlist has garnered a much higher share of the soybean market? Charles Magro : Adam, let me give you the overall backdrop. And then I think Robert can give you sort of the specifics to your questions. What we'd say is that there is a lot of competitive tension right now, and it's not one thing. I think it's still the industry working through the global destocking that we've seen. And the good news is there are some green shoots. The U.S. seems to be behind it. We've called out though that the market is going back to sort of just-in-time closer to the application window. So there's some timing and seasonality there. Europe is going through the destocking now, and it's been through the -- in terms of the first quarter. And then they've had some difficult weather that we've already talked about this morning and even some missed applications. But I think they're trending in the right direction. APAC has been a little bit less impactful. They had some but not a significant amount, at least not in the products and the portfolios that we participate in. So then it comes down to Brazil. And the bottom line with Brazil is, it is still imbalanced. It is trending in the right direction. We're seeing the channel inventories reduce certainly from the December numbers that we've seen early numbers now for the first quarter that are positive and heading in the right direction. But Brazil still needs to destock a little bit more. And we think that will happen. It goes without saying, but on-farm demand in Crop Protection globally is still stable and healthy. And that is a very important statement. So with that, now I'll turn it over to Robert to answer your question on Enlist and the attach rates. Robert King : Thanks, Chuck. Price competition, as Chuck talked about, is pretty stiff. But our price for value continues to be pulled through by the industry and creates value on the farm. When you think about our new products and Spinosyns combined and the performance rate there, they continue to perform better than the portfolio and better than the industry. And this first quarter was no different. These things aren't immune to impacts of the environment of marketing -- market environment, et cetera. But then on the specific to Enlist, it continues to have a strong pull, very strong demand. We expect spray rates to be still in that 80% range as we've seen in the past. And we do expect that we'll see continued volume growth this year over last year with this technology. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Ryan Weis : You've got Ryan on for Aleksey here. Just wanted to dig in a little bit on the generics in Brazil. I know in 3Q, you kind of saw an influx of imports, which you then called out a little bit of a slowdown in 4Q. Just trying to understand how that progressed throughout 1Q and what you're kind of seeing today? Charles Magro : Yes. So look, I think we even called it out in our fourth quarter in February that the generic imports into Brazil have what I'd call stabilized to sort of more normal import rates. And so they've always been part of the market, and they've been a larger part in APAC and Brazil. That's -- there's nothing new there. There is some new capacity coming online for some AIs that are coming off patent. And certainly, our strategy as a company overall is to sell differentiation, value agronomic service. And so there's a lot of the parts of the generic market where Corteva is simply just not focused on. So I'd say that the market fundamentals today when we look at the global CP market, and I think this comment applies to Brazil as well. There is nothing here that is a structural change that we can see. I think that this has been played out now and what we're seeing are sort of the return to normalization. The big question is when will we see that in some of these key markets, specifically Brazil? But the direction is clear after a couple of these data points have now come out that the inventories are receding, and we do expect, as we called out that in the second half of 2024 we should see Brazil volumes start to improve. And then as we get to 2025, we would expect that the global CP industry would return to some level of growth. It's a little early to talk specifically about that because we've got to get through the second half of 2024. But I think that that's what we are kind of assuming as we look forward from second half of '24 and into '25. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Theurer from Barclays. Rahi Parikh : This is Rahi filling in for Ben. So I just wanted to look more into trade down within the space. So when farmers have tighter wallets like today, do you see data on farmers shying away from biologicals and mainly just buying CP that they fundamentally need. I believe this plays into seeds when farmers choose GMCs but those that have fewer GM traits. Maybe there's also a geographic difference, if there's any regions that trade down quicker than others? Just any color on that. Charles Magro : Let me give you my perspective, and then I think it would be helpful to hear from Robert and Tim on this one. So generally, what we've seen in this crop environment, but also sort of stronger conditions and even weaker conditions than we have today, farmers are always prioritizing production per acre because, in many cases, the last few bushels per acre will be their profit. And so from an overall crop inputs perspective, we have not seen a significant trend down in sort of a selection of different types of seed technology, for example. And we don't see them skipping applications, especially when they have real disease or pester or weed pressures. And when it comes to biologicals, actually, the second half of 2023 is sort of the proof point, very difficult conditions for farmers in South America. But our biologicals business was very solid. And that's because, I think, certainly, the products that we sell are not considered to be fringe or nice to have. I think they're core to plant health, to their physiology, to how they will grow and yield. And so the farmers will most likely make other decisions if things get a little tighter in terms of capital purchases and land acquisitions. But their core fertility packages and their core crop input packages, we don't really see them trading down. Tim, your thoughts. Timothy Glenn : No, Chuck, I agree. I think the thing you have to remember is that the technologies in seed is not just the yield that they're pursuing or -- out there, but it's the whole production system, especially when you talk about the utilization of biotechnology traits. Those traits not only provide some benefit in the field, but it also changes how they manage over the course of the season, and they see a lot of value in that and we have no evidence that they trade down.  And the thing I always remind when margins get tight for farmers, it's not that first bushel you produce, it's that last bushel that determines what's going to fall to the bottom line. And so I think customers understand what makes them money and they continue to invest in the things that are going to make them money over time. And in the case of seed, it's high-yielding genetics and the technology to help protect the trade or protect those yields. Charles Magro : And Robert, how about biologicals? Robert King : Yes. Biologicals is -- they're a core part of the crop plan and the customers we serve. And so we've seen those while not immune to everything that's going on, they've held up, as Chuck said, very, very well. And when you think about the acquisitions we made and the benefit in '23, we were just under $500 million sales this last year, and we expect this to grow in the mid-20s this year and we'll double the contribution to the business. And this is all a testament to the strength of the portfolio and the people that are showing the value to the farmers as we get into this season. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : I guess, you guys didn't include the '25 slide. So I just wanted to maybe get your thoughts on if there's -- if anything there has changed. I think you've highlighted maybe $100 million from royalty improvement as well as -- or sorry, biologicals contribution, $200 million from your productivity actions. So that would leave maybe $300 million to the midpoint for low single-digit seed pricing and some of the other dynamics on the Crop Protection side. So would you just maybe offer your thoughts on if all of those drivers are still intact? David Anderson : Thanks, Arun. Very good question. So we're still expecting the bottom line performance consistent with the financial framework we've provided for you for 2025. And just as a reminder, it's that $3.9 billion to $4.4 billion EBITDA range. And as you said, the key components, maybe just spend a quick minute here going through some of those elements. First of all, as you pointed out, net pricing gains for the total company.  That's going to be important. That's going to be led by our Seed business, but very important. Crop Protection is going to have gains, and Robert spoke to that in terms of the 2024 performance outlook and particularly our second half, that's going to carry through into 2025 for new products, Biologicals and Spinosyns, the contribution margin there, quite attractive. On the controllables, the royalty benefit, I mentioned earlier when we were talking about the deflation and cost of raw materials, ingredients and commodities, we're going to see a deflation benefit higher net in 2025 compared to 2024.  We'll have other cost of sales improvements that will translate, including the progress that we're making on the Crop Protection footprint optimization. And then finally, we'll have some higher investment in R&D and some modest increase in SG&A that will offset that. But the formula is very, very much intact, building off that midpoint of the guide that we've provided you for 2024. So thanks a lot for the question. Operator : That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to David Anderson for closing remarks. Please go ahead. David Anderson : Well, first, let me tell you, thanks again for your participation today and the quality of the questions. We very much appreciate the interest, obviously, in Corteva. We look forward to speaking to a number of you in follow-up to today's call. And also, we look forward to seeing you in New York City on November 19 for an Investor Day. So thanks again. Have a great day. Appreciate it. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Corteva Agriscience 2Q 2024 Earnings. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kim Booth, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Kim Booth : Good morning. And welcome to Corteva\u2019s second quarter and first half 2024 earnings conference call. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Chuck Magro, Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Anderson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Tim Glenn, Executive Vice President, Seed Business Unit; and Robert King, Executive Vice President, Crop Protection Business Unit, will join the Q&A session. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks during this call, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of the Corteva website and through the link to our webcast. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are our expectations about the future. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could materially differ from these statements due to these risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those discussed on this call and in the risk factors section of our reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please note in today\u2019s presentation, we\u2019ll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release and related schedules, along with our Supplemental Financial Summary slide deck, available on our Investor Relations website. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Magro : Thanks, Kim. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We plan to update you today on our second quarter and first half performance, share our latest expectations for the second half of this year. In the second quarter, Corteva delivered both top and bottomline growth and nearly 250 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion. This was driven by strong demand for our proprietary technology, which was also particularly evident in our Seed business results. We also saw Crop Protection volumes grow, a sign that the industry is starting to stabilize after almost two years of decline. Seed continued its impressive trajectory in the first half of the year, with 420 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion and broad-based pricing gains across all regions. While North America corn acres are down year-over-year, the team has managed to hold volumes relatively flat and gain share in the first half, a testament to both strong demand for our latest corn hybrids, as well as the strength of the Pioneer business model. Performance in Seed remains strong across products and technologies, and we are proud to be number one in the North America seed market for both corn and soybeans. We are particularly pleased to see Enlist E3 continue to be valued by farmers and we believe E3 technology is the future. It is on at least 65% of U.S. soybean acres in 2024. Earlier this year, we announced the commercial availability of Pioneer brand Z-series soybeans in the U.S. and Canada, which is the next generation of industry-leading genetics with the Enlist traits. This new class of soybeans offers farmers a strong defensive package, with a generational leap in yield potential and agronomic performance over any soybean lineup Pioneer has ever introduced. In extensive 2023 IMPACT trials, Z-series soybeans showed an average yield advantage of 2.7 bushels per acre over our own A-series soybeans, which delivers substantial economic benefit to growers. And I know most of you are well aware of how the Enlist transition has supported our aim of becoming royalty neutral by the end of the decade, but it\u2019s worth noting that our royalty income stream is also accelerating quickly in corn. In the first half of this year, we grew our royalty income by an impressive 40% when compared to the same period last year, led by the strength of new corn trait technologies like PowerCore Enlist. Our strategy of becoming a technology seller is gaining traction as reflected in our margins. Turning to the CP business, we can say that here too our technology remains a driver for farmers. By the end of June, we had registered over 100 new Crop Protection products globally. These new product registrations give farmers access to new, cutting-edge solutions that can help them increase yields and grow more food and fuel. Overall, the Crop Protection business continues to navigate an imbalanced market, driven largely by residual destocking and competitive market dynamics. Still, we are encouraged by the 6% volume improvement in the second quarter. Although net sales and operating EBITDA were down for the half, we\u2019re still anticipating that 2024 will be another year of top and bottomline growth and margin improvement for Corteva. Record-setting demand for grain, oil, seeds and biofuels is expected to continue through the end of 2024. On-farm Crop Protection demand remains stable as farmers prioritize technology to maximize yield and we expect the market to begin to move towards more of a balance between sell-in and sell-out at the channel. We also anticipate that farmers will continue to prioritize investments in top-tier seed technologies, given their direct impact on yields. To reflect the impact of the competitive market dynamics and weather-driven missed applications in North America and Europe in the first half for Crop Protection, we are lowering our full year net sales guidance by about 1% and operating EBITDA by about 2%, versus the midpoints we guided to last quarter. A few comments on 2025. It\u2019s still early and we need to see how the full year of 2024 plays out. Generally speaking, we remain constructive on 2025 and we are on a path that would get us into the framework for operating EBITDA and margin improvement. We feel good about what we can control delivering meaningful royalty benefits, productivity and cost deflation on a year-over-year basis. Recall when we adjusted the 2025 framework back in February, we indicated that it was contingent upon stabilization in the Crop Protection market in 2024 and a return to growth in 2025. The volume improvement in the second quarter has given us some optimism in our second-half growth assumptions, but we\u2019re monitoring the competitive pricing environment very closely. We\u2019ll be providing more of a detailed update on our views of 2025 at our Investor Day event in November. Now turning to the outlook. The U.S. crop mix shift from corn to soybeans played out as we expected. However, the main feature of 2024 growing season thus far has been the U.S. corn and soybean crop condition ratings have been running well above 2023, creating an expectation for strong yields. Time will tell, but it is clear that strong yields are being dialed into the corn futures. As global stocks of major grains and oilseeds stabilize, commodity prices have started to come under pressure, indicative that we\u2019re now below mid-cycle pricing. These lower prices combined with higher interest rates have led farmers to tighten their operating approach. But there is still a lot of confidence with the vast majority of farmers, and they know the formula for success and how to be prudent with the investment decisions they make in their operations. And they know they have to drive productivity in order to be competitive in the marketplace. Brand trust and the years of experience and expertise behind it is also extremely important. Farmers can always find cheaper seeds, but with Corteva brands, they know they can trust our long history of incremental annual yield improvement, which gives them confidence in the outcome, as well as peace of mind. And like most of us, once you experience the best, it\u2019s hard for farmers to settle for anything less. With that, let me turn it over to Dave for insights on our financial results and outlook. Dave Anderson : Thanks, Chuck, and welcome everyone to the call. Let\u2019s start on Slide 6, which provides the financial results for the quarter and the half. You can see from the numbers here, sales and operating EBITDA for the first half were down slightly from prior year, although a little better than our latest estimates, driven by a strong finish in North America\u2019s seeds season. Briefly touching on the quarter, organic sales were up 2% compared to prior year, with gains in both Seed and Crop Protection. Pricing for the quarter was up 2%, with gains in Seed partially offset by continued competitive pressure in Crop Protection. Second quarter volumes were flat with volume gains in Crop Protection, led by Latin America and North America, offset by Seed volume declines in North America due to first quarter and second quarter timing. Topline growth and continued productivity and cost actions translated to earnings growth of 10% in the quarter in nearly 250 basis points of margin expansion compared to prior year. Now focusing on the half, as a result of the tough first quarter, organic sales were down 2%, with Seed growth offset by Crop Protection. Seed pricing gains were mid-single-digit compared to prior year and offset by Seed volume declines, which were driven by lower planted area in EMEA and in Asia. Crop Protection price and volume were both down in the half on competitive market dynamics in the really tough comp of the first quarter of 2023. The topline performance translated into operating EBITDA of approximately $2.95 billion for the half, down slightly compared to prior year. Seed pricing, the benefits from improved net royalty expense and productivity savings drove nearly 60 basis points of margin expansion. Let\u2019s now go to Slide 7 and review sales by segment. Seed net sales were up 2% in the half versus prior year. Organic sales were up 4% on broad-based pricing gains as we continue to price for value. Global seed pricing was up 5% with gains in every region and across the portfolio. In Crop Protection, both net sales and organic sales were down 11% in the half. Pricing was down 4% compared to prior year, driven by competitive price pressure and market dynamics. Crop Protection pricing in EMEA was up 2%, largely in response to currency. Crop Protection volumes were down in the half, although we did see volume growth of 6% in the second quarter. Demand for new products, expenses, drove volume gains over last year, and importantly, we continue to expect volume growth in the second half, driven largely by Brazil. With that, let\u2019s go to Slide 8 for a summary of the first half operating EBITDA performance. For the half, operating EBITDA was just under our record first half 2023 to just over $2.95 billion. Pricing gains, coupled with improvement in net royalties and productivity actions, were offset by volume declines in cost and currency headwinds. Higher Seed commodity costs and Crop Protection inflation on input costs, reflecting the sell-through of higher cost inventory, were more than offset by benefits for reduced net royalty expense and productivity savings. SG&A for the half was up 1%, including an additional $25 million of spend compared to prior year related to biologicals acquisitions. Excluding these costs, SG&A would have been approximately flat versus last year, despite merit and inflation. Let\u2019s now go to Slide 9 and transition to the updated outlook for the year. The updated full year guidance reflects the current Seed and Crop Protection markets and the best judgment of our key variables for the second half. We now expect net sales to be in the range of $17.2 billion to $17.5 billion, or up 1% at the midpoint. The lower guidance and revenues is primarily due to North America and EMEA Crop Protection price and volume in the first half of the year, in the updated second half BRL to U.S. dollar assumptions. Operating EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion, 4% growth compared to prior year at the midpoint. The updated guidance is driven by lower topline growth, partially offset by less discretionary spending. We also now expect a cost tailwind for the year, driven by improved royalty expense, Crop Protection raw material deflation and productivity benefits, and while we still expect increased R&D and SG&A for the year, the increases will be more modest than our prior guidance. With the strength of Seed performance in the first half and Crop Protection volume and cost improvement in the second half of the year, we now expect operating EBITDA margin for the year of approximately 20% at the midpoint of guidance or approximately 55 basis points above of margin expansion over last year. Operating EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.60 per share to $2.80 per share, roughly flat versus last year at the midpoint. The change in EPS from our prior guidance primarily reflects lower earnings at the midpoint. We\u2019re reaffirming our pre-cash flow guidance of $1.5 billion to $2 billion or approximately $1.75 billion at the midpoint, and cash flow to EBITDA conversion rate of 45% to 50% for the full year 2024. And finally, we\u2019re on track to complete 1 billion of share repurchases for the year, including 500 million completed during the first half. We also recently announced a 6.25% increase in the annual dividend, consistent with the dividend growth strategy. Now, both of these are testimony to the strength of our balance sheet and the cash flow outlook. Going now to Slide 10, let\u2019s look at the key drivers for the first half performance and the setup for the remainder of the year. Again, the first half results were overall slightly ahead of our expectations, driven by the strength of the Seed business. North America delivered an impressive performance with 4% growth in organic sales compared to prior year, despite the 3% reduction in U.S. corn acres. Crop Protection first half results were impacted by competitive market pressures. Overall Crop Protection industry conditions have begun to improve, but not yet fully stabilized. Crop Protection experienced low-single-digit rate inflation on input costs through the first half. Those market-driven cost headwinds were offset by benefits related to reduced seed net royalty expense and productivity action. SG&A and R&D, as expected, were up modestly compared to last year. Now, if you turn to the right side of Slide 10 regarding the second half of the year, our assumptions are largely consistent with what we shared with you in early May. In Seed, we expect a rebound in Brazil\u2019s safrinha corn area after a reduction in the 2023-2024 season. However, an additional risk in Latin America is Argentina\u2019s planted area due to corn stunts. Crop Protection volume gains will drive much of the growth in the second half, with pricing expected to remain challenged. Our assumption is for volume growth versus prior year, led by Brazil, and demand for new products and biologicals. Importantly, the order book for the second half Crop Protection sales in Brazil is trending ahead of last year. Available data suggests channel inventories are trending down. These data points are positive signals that the market is moving towards more stabilization and supports the assumptions for volume growth in the second half. And as you know, we expect to see input cost deflation in Crop Protection during the second half of the year. Coupled with productivity and cost actions, we anticipate a cost tailwind for Crop Protection. And as a reminder, we expect an increase in SG&A spend for the full year 2024, driven by normalized bad debt and compensation accruals and will also continue to increase the investment in R&D. So the balance of improved Crop Protection market conditions in Brazil and the continued focus on cost controls will drive second half growth. It\u2019s important to point out the allocation of earnings between third and fourth quarters. We expect normal earnings patterns for the second half, which implies an operating EBITDA loss in the third quarter, and therefore, all of the second half earnings delivered in the fourth quarter. So let\u2019s now go to Slide 11 and summarize the key takeaways. First, operating EBITDA performance for the first half was largely in line with expectations led by the strength of the Seed business. Regarding the full year, driven mostly by the current market dynamics in Crop Protection, we\u2019re updating our full year guidance, but still on track for sales and earnings growth in 2024. Seed momentum continues through the first half, driven by the strength of the portfolio and strong demand for our latest technology, particularly in North America, with market share captured in both corn and soybeans. Overall, it\u2019s been an impressive first half for the Seed business and continuing a strong trend by seed. Looking forward to the second half of the year, Crop Protection volume gains in Latin America and cost improvement from raw material deflation and productivity actions will drive much of the year-over-year EBITDA growth. And finally, strong first half cash flow results keep us on track to deliver the midpoint of our free cash flow guidance range of $1.75 billion or approximately 50% conversion rate. And with that, let me turn it back over to Kim. Kim Booth : Thanks, Dave. Now, before we get into the Q&A, Chuck, I believe you\u2019d like to make a few closing remarks. Chuck Magro : Thanks, Kim. I\u2019d like to say a few words about the announcement we made after market yesterday that we will have a new Chief Financial Officer starting September 16th. David Johnson will join Corteva from Atkore, a publicly traded company and leader in electrical safety and infrastructure solutions, where he also served as CFO. David is an accomplished CFO with a proven track record of delivering strong results, operational efficiency, and financial discipline to large global organizations like ours. He has nearly three decades of experience, and as I\u2019ve gotten to know David throughout this process, I believe he is the perfect choice for Corteva. David will, of course, succeed Dave Anderson. To ensure a smooth transition, Dave will continue to serve on the executive leadership team as a strategic advisor to me until his retirement in the first quarter of 2025. Dave joined Corteva over three years ago, which was, as many of you will remember, both a pivotal and critical time in our history. With his wealth of experience and his considerable expertise across industries, Dave gave this company, its Board, and its leadership assurance that this company\u2019s financial strategy was in the best of hands, and I think the results speak for themselves. So before I turn it over to Dave, I\u2019d like to thank him for his service and his dedication to Corteva, to our investors and shareholders, and to our customers and employees. Dave, thank you. It\u2019s been an absolute privilege to serve alongside of you, and with that, over to you. Dave Anderson : Thanks, Chuck. I really appreciate the kind words. It\u2019s obviously just been a terrific opportunity to work with Corteva, to work with you and the organization over the last several years, and I\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish, and I\u2019m really pleased with the strengthening of finance team and the alignment of the finance organization to support our Crop Protection and Seed business unit. And I\u2019m looking forward to supporting David in this transition. I know it\u2019s going to be a successful one. I know he\u2019s going to be a terrific CFO for Corteva. So thanks very much. Kim Booth : Thanks, Dave. Now let\u2019s move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. And first of all, Dave, congratulations on your retirement and thank you very much for all the help over the past three years. Chuck, if I could ask you on your sort of initial comments on 2025, and please correct me where I\u2019m wrong, but it sounded to me like you were sort of softening your stance on 2025 and sort of not saying, hey, I took 2024 down by $100 million, so just take that existing $3.9 billion to $4.4 billion range down by $100 million. So I want to check in on those bridge items and see what\u2019s still intact versus what your incremental concerns might be. So you had $100 million of royalty improvement for 2025, another $200 million of productivity and cost actions for 2025, and I know we had been talking about but hadn\u2019t quantified some seed cost deflation for 2025, and then at least I expected some more crop chemical deflation for 2025. So if you could update us on those items, if there\u2019s any change, and then also indicate, is it the Crop Protection pricing that you\u2019re concerned about maybe deteriorating further or are you worried about being able to get seed price mix in 2025 if the futures curves stay where they are? Thank you. Chuck Magro : Yeah. Good morning, Vincent. So great question. I guess let me start by just saying we still have a lot of conviction over 2025. We feel very good about the things that are obviously in our control, and if you\u2019ve looked at sort of how we describe the controllable levers, whether it\u2019s Seed out-licensing, the productivity and cost improvement that we\u2019re working through, biologicals growth, all these things, we said $350 million to $450 million in both 2024 and 2025. We\u2019re thinking that that number now is certainly north of $400 million for each of the years. So very good around the controllables. When you think about Seed, we remain very comfortable with our base assumptions for 2024 and moving into 2025 and I would even go beyond 2025. The technology pipeline that we\u2019ve built, we think is second to none in the industry, and our out-licensing now is ramping up very nicely as we made comments in our prepared remarks. And then as you rightly called out, we can see deflation now that\u2019s in the P&L in both Seed and CP. You\u2019re right, we have not given you full quantities yet. We\u2019ll do that at the right time. But we think that that could be a significant tailwind as we think through 2025 and even beyond that. So when you put all that together, we\u2019re very comfortable with, if you look at the forward guide now for 2024 and then you look at some of the ranges we\u2019ve provided for 2025 and what we call the value framework, we\u2019re very comfortable we\u2019re on a path to that range. The biggest question though, and we can\u2019t ignore it, right, is not when we think about CP pricing. So we needed to see a few things in this quarter, and so we\u2019re feeling pretty good that we saw volume growth in Q2 when it comes to CP, but it\u2019s been a pretty competitive environment when it comes to pricing. And so that\u2019s the thing that we\u2019re watching. We\u2019re not overly concerned, but it\u2019s something we\u2019re keeping an eye on. And the 2025 framework then needs to connect to that.\\ And what we\u2019re hoping to see now is further stabilization in the CP industry. And then eventually this market will return to growth because we\u2019ve got two years now where we\u2019ve seen declining organic growth, and to see three years, it would be quite unprecedented. It\u2019s happened before, but it\u2019s been quite rare. And so we\u2019re still feeling that our base assumption of some growth in 2025 makes sense. And when you put all that together, I think the value framework would still be very comfortable for Corteva. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO. Your line is open. Joel Jackson : Hi. Good morning. Just following up on that. So the last hour, one of your competitors was talking about seeing kind of 6% revenue growth next year in crop chems. Speaking to what you\u2019re talking about, a volume recovery but competitive prices price decline. So I know it\u2019s following up on the prior question here, but is that in the ballpark of what you\u2019re seeing more higher or lower, and why would you be higher or lower than say that benchmark? Chuck Magro : Yeah. Let me give you a perspective, Joel, and then I\u2019ll have Dave just talk about how we built the forward guide and Dave can give you some specifics. So, when we look at CP for the second quarter, our price was down approximately 5%, but our volumes were up 6%, and we really needed to see the volume growth. I think from a Corteva perspective, and I\u2019m only going to speak about Corteva today. I think what we wanted to do is make sure that we manage the inventories going into the channel. Because look, we need to learn from what\u2019s happened, right? And we want our recovery when we look at Corteva to be sustainable as we work through the quarters. And so we\u2019re very comfortable. We like the path that we\u2019re on. I think when we think about how we guided the market, it\u2019s important to say that the midpoint came down about $100 million. Really, that was sort of first half impact, right? But we had some pretty significant weather that impacted the CP business, we lost some sprays, both in Europe and the U.S., and then there was the pricing dynamic, which we\u2019ve already called out. So now when you think about how to think about the rest of 2024, Dave, I\u2019ll let you kind of comment on that. Dave Anderson : Sure, Chuck. And I think too, just related to 2025, I think, Chuck, we would get into any details and any specifics regarding that at a later time. It\u2019s really too early to comment on that. But importantly, Joel, as you know, for the first half, let me talk about our pricing assumptions just a little bit and then we can talk about overall market, and Robert, you may want to comment a little bit just on what we\u2019re seeing at the farm gate in terms of just the continued demand there and the steadiness of that demand. But on the -- for the first half, as you saw, round numbers, we were around 4% pricing headwind in the business, Crop Protection business, 3.5%, specifically for the first half. And our expectation is for the full year, that\u2019s going to be a little greater, probably in the, I\u2019m going to call it the low- to mid-single digits, really driven by the mix -- the geographic mix. We\u2019ve got a much larger, as you know, an increase in Latin America\u2019s percent of total for the second half. So that\u2019s what\u2019s really influencing that number. When we look at volumes and volume expectations for the industry, and I\u2019ll let Robert comment on this more. I mean, all of what we\u2019re seeing, signs of what we\u2019re seeing, as Chuck said, are pointing to some return to normalcy, stabilization, if you will. And we\u2019re seeing that in terms of the demand, in terms of usage of product, including the differentiated products that are, in terms of technology -- possessed technology and efficacy that the farmer needs. Robert, you may want to just comment a little bit about that, because I think that bears on the health of the overall business and the outlook. Robert King : Thanks, Dave. Joel, we finished up about as we expected in the first half. And so as you begin, as we move into the second half, you\u2019re going to see growth from really three areas in Crop Protection, new products, spinosad and biologicals. These will account for about 65% of our total growth for the business in the second half. And these are product areas that -- product lines that are performing better than the market and definitely better than the rest of our portfolio and historically have done so as well. And further to that confidence of what we\u2019re seeing and our expectations, Brazil order book is very healthy and much more so than it was last year. We\u2019re about 20% ahead of where we were last year. So, again, that gives us confidence that things are moving. And then we think when you look at our biologicals, we have 70% of our full year orders already in hand. And so once again, it gives us lots of optimism for the second half that we\u2019ll be able to do what we\u2019re saying we can do and that\u2019ll roll into 2025. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Chris Parkinson : Good afternoon. So one of your competitors put out its preliminary U.S. Seed price card fairly early. I think 10 years ago it would have been on our hard-hit to go in August and now we have somebody putting out an early July. What are your presumptions in the marketplace of why that was done in terms of your current share gains in certain row crops, presumably soy, as well as your ongoing field performance? It\u2019s probably a little bit early to comment on the latter, but just any commentary and insight on why you think that was done would be particularly helpful. Thank you. Tim Glenn : Hey, Chris. This is Tim. I\u2019ll take a shot at this. So, it\u2019s hard to comment on what the motivations were for putting a price card out early. When you put a price card out early, there\u2019s -- I\u2019d say a gap in details in terms of what you understand. You don\u2019t necessarily know what the mixed products that they\u2019re going to sell. You don\u2019t necessarily know what their growth net\u2019s going to be. And my best guess right now is there\u2019s not a farmer who\u2019s made a buy decision yet based off of that. So we\u2019re in the process of developing our 2025 plans. And I\u2019d say we\u2019re weeks away from North America. We\u2019re generally pretty consistent in terms of timing and we\u2019ll stick to that timing as well. A little bit later in Europe, but more like a month or two out from most of Europe. As we think about going into this market, obviously every year is a little bit different, and it\u2019s different in terms of the environment you\u2019re selling into, as well as what you\u2019re bringing to the market. What I\u2019d say is in 2025, as we put together our pricing plans, especially in North America, it\u2019s really driven by innovation and new technology. And the value approach that we take in terms of delivering value to our customer doesn\u2019t change here. So on corn, we have a very favorable mix enhancement as we think about introducing new hybrids with Vorceed and PowerCore, two very exciting and important technologies on corn that we\u2019ll be ramping up this year. And as was mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re also going to have a significant ramp up of our Z-series soybeans, which will be within Enlist and really take our value prop to the next level with farmers. So, overall, our philosophy never changes. It is value driven, it\u2019s technology driven and it\u2019s focused on innovation and making sure that our customers have access to that new technology. And we have that long -- I\u2019d say longstanding trust and understanding from our customers as we bring them something new and better that we\u2019re going to share in that value. So certainly a different market environment, can\u2019t really speculate on our competition and what their motivations are, but our focus and our approach really doesn\u2019t change in this environment. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical. Your line is open. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you and good morning. Chuck, in adjusting the guidance, you called out a number of different factors, including corn stunt and the impact on acreage in Argentina, some flooding in Southern Brazil, and the Crop Protection chemical pricing environment, and perhaps, there are other factors. And so my question would be, how would you sort of rank order the relative importance of those? And then with regard to the pricing dynamic in particular, I was wondering if you could expand on the question of whether or not you had any one-time incentives embedded in the 5% price erosion as one of your competitors seemed to highlight earlier this morning. Chuck Magro : Good morning, Kevin. So let me, I\u2019ll start and then Dave should certainly comment. So, as we\u2019ve mentioned already, the lowering of the guide was really a lot driven by where we are after the first half, right? So weather, missed applications and then the CP pricing dynamic. The second half of the year, when we start thinking about it, what we\u2019re looking for is CP volume growth and a similar pricing dynamic that Dave just called out. And really the determining factor for the confidence in the second half will be on two things. It\u2019ll be on controlling the cost and the productivity controllables that we have and we feel very good about that. And then Brazil, and really it\u2019s Brazil volume that we\u2019re focused on. When you start thinking about the range though, the upside and the downside and the guide range, we kept it this time a little bit wider than we normally do at this time of the year, and that\u2019s really to reflect some of the uncertainty we\u2019re seeing in Argentina when it comes to corn stunt. And Argentine farmers right now are not looking to buy the Seed. So it is an uncertainty and there\u2019s a lot of different estimates out there. So we feel we\u2019re pretty nicely captured between, if you think about the guide range between $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion, we would fall into that range, I think, with what we know today, and this is evolving -- the story\u2019s evolving, from the planted acres in Argentina. And then the assumption for the midpoint certainly captured when we\u2019ve said this before in Brazil, to capture some of the planted acres that we lost last season. And that was really driven by weather. So we think things are looking better in Brazil, but time will tell and it\u2019s still a little early to call victory on that as well. And then if you think about the upside of the guide range, and Dave, you should weigh in on this, that would have the global CP market starting to stabilize and more of a return to growth, which isn\u2019t out of the question in this market environment, but we did put that as the upside for the guide range. Dave, did I miss anything? Dave Anderson : I think you captured very well, just to maybe state the perspective just in a slightly differently, just to reiterate to some degree what Chuck said. Kevin, in that base $3.5 billion, we\u2019ve obviously got, as Chuck said, when talking about prepared remarks, the Brazil area of recovery, as well as the CP volume growth, you spoke to that, Robert spoke to that, in terms of particularly driven by Latin America, but also to some degree, APAC and North America increase in the second half, but really significantly driven by Brazil. Pricing, we\u2019ve given you the assumptions there. We feel that\u2019s good in terms of what we\u2019re seeing and our expectations. And then the other key point is what we\u2019ve got dialed in, in terms of cost deflation for the Crop Protection raw materials. So those are the kind of the base, and then Chuck did a good job of just outlining on sort of the plus minus of that, and obviously, one of the things we\u2019re monitoring, Tim, you\u2019re monitoring, and we\u2019ll know more later, is the overall Argentine corn planted area, just that phenomenon. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. Dave Anderson : So I would say that\u2019s the way we would see it, Kevin. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. David Begleiter : Thank you and good morning. Chuck, just again, back on CP, I think you said, you\u2019re not overly concerned on the pricing pressure here. Why is that? And specifically, is the threat from generic producers in China, in your view, more or less than it was a year or two ago? Thank you. Chuck Magro : Yeah. So, look, we think that there\u2019s a lot going on in the CP industry, David, and a lot of this that we\u2019ll reference now, we think will run its course, and it\u2019s on a pathway of having an improved and what I would consider to be a healthier CP market overall. So when you start thinking about all of the moving parts here, what we\u2019re finding is that a lot of the industry players now are moving through their high-priced inventory, which is natural and it\u2019s part of the healing process that we would consider as part of the overall industry dynamic. But what I would say is that, the fundamentals, what you have to keep sort of first and foremost, and the reason we\u2019re not overly concerned, and we\u2019ve said this in the prepared remarks, but it\u2019s important to state again, on-farm demand is healthy. And in the first time in two years, I\u2019d say what\u2019s going into the channel is now coming out of the channel. And so this is just a much healthier overall structure that we haven\u2019t seen in a couple of years. So you\u2019ve got this dynamic where what\u2019s generally going into the channel is going out of the channel, on-farm applications are healthy. Of course, farmers are being smart about their investments and their applications, they always are. But what we\u2019re seeing is that that channel is a lot healthier. So that gives us some confidence. And then what we needed to see was the volume growth into the channel in the second quarter. That was the first sign of what I would consider to be a stable market. And so the pricing dynamic is the way we\u2019ve described it. But as we work through this journey a little bit more and we need now to finalize this with Brazil, because we would say that from a destocking perspective, the U.S. and now I\u2019d say Europe, they\u2019re more or less destocked. And if you notice, we haven\u2019t used that language too much today, because we\u2019re feeling that the industry is finally behind that. We have to go through now the Brazil environment. But like Robert said, certainly our order book is healthier than it was this time last year and farmers are planning to apply the product in the fourth quarter. So when you put it all together, I think we are on a journey of stabilization. We feel like this is where we needed to be at this time of the year. But we do need to see how the second half actually unfolds. But that\u2019s why we have, I think, guarded optimism is the way I would describe it. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is open. Josh Spector : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Two things, if I can quickly here. First, I apologies if I missed this. But can you talk about your volume expectations in CP for the second half as you go through 3Q and 4Q? One of your peers just talked about a healthier 4Q versus 3Q. I wonder if you\u2019re seeing that the same way. And then secondly, thinking more longer term, I guess, Chuck, particularly given your experience in the industry, I think, you guys have talked about confidence on Seed pricing. But what typically have you seen -- you talked about you\u2019re not concerned about trade down, but what have you seen in prior cycles, particularly year one of a more pinched farmer? Chuck Magro : Yeah. Good morning, Josh. So do you want to talk about volumes, Robert, and then I\u2019ll come back and we should hear from Tim as well on Seed. Robert King : Yeah. Thanks. Well, on the volume stem for second half in Crop Protection, I\u2019ll let Dave talk specifically about some of the splits, but relatively balanced. Dave can reference some more numbers if needed there. But when you think of us on Q3 and Q4, we don\u2019t have a large swing. It\u2019s about normal is the way I would think about it. Things are moving, as Chuck talked about, more stabilized. Brazil inventories are approaching normal ranges. And a large part of our business is Latin America in the second half. Specific to volume, we\u2019re going to be in mid-teens up on a second half basis. And again, that gives us optimism on how we see things shaping up for second half. Dave, something to add? Dave Anderson : No. That covered it well, Robert. Let me just say that when we talk about normalization, it\u2019s interesting, because -- and we\u2019ve mentioned this previously, but when you look at, for example, the Latin American numbers, you\u2019re really comparing to the weak second half of 2023 and particularly the fourth quarter of 2023. So some of the V percent that you\u2019re looking at, go back and look at cumulative, or if you look at cumulative volumes, 2022 and 2023 compared to 2020, or 2023 and 2024 compared to 2022, that\u2019s when you get into more of a, just a really normal, if you will, sort of expectation in terms of pattern. And there\u2019s nothing, Robert, to your point, I think that stands out between 3Q and 4Q. Tim, do you want to comment on Seed? Tim Glenn : Yeah. On the Seed side, we get the question a lot about the trading down and maybe I\u2019ll think about it in a couple ways. One is, in terms of technology ladder, it is very difficult for a farmer, once they\u2019ve had certain Seed technologies, to be able to move down the ladder, if you want to think of that. So if they\u2019re used to planting, above ground insect control with certain herbicide-resistant traits, they kind of built their operation around that. If they\u2019re used to being triples above and below ground with multiple modes of herbicide resistance, they kind of are built that, equipment, labor, the whole bit is around that and we\u2019ve not seen any meaningful trade down over time. And certainly, as recently as six years or seven years ago, we were in a very difficult environment and didn\u2019t see the trade down at that point in time. On the -- if you think about from a genetic side or trading down on brand, I think that what you have to understand is, you can say Seed is interchangeable, you can get different trade packages or comparable trade packages from different companies, but one thing about Seed is it is a very emotional decision. And for that farmer, it\u2019s not just confidence that the genetics are going to perform and deliver a certain level of yield that\u2019s consistent with their expectations, but it\u2019s also the ability to be able to handle adversity, consistency over time, and plus the support and service they get from their point of sale. And so, in a situation like this, our value proposition has to make sense and we\u2019re quite confident, that what we\u2019re delivering to those customers will be, make sense to them, will be additive to their operation. And then the other point is, at times like this, especially when margins are compressed at the farm operation level, that last bushel is maybe all the profit that they make, if you want to think of it that way or put them in a positive cash flow situation. And so, they see Seed differently than other decisions that they make over the course of their Seed operation. So, never take it for granted, always stay close to the customer and help them understand our value proposition. But history has shown that Seed holds in well. Chuck Magro : Yeah. Josh, just I\u2019ll echo what Tim said very quickly. So, in all my years, whether it was being a retailer or now on the Seed side, we just don\u2019t see it. And the reason we don\u2019t see it is because it\u2019s akin to gambling. That germplasm, especially if you think about our germplasm, it\u2019s approaching 100 years now and we\u2019ve got more than decades of experience in breeding. And if you just think about the Z series that we just rolled out, that three bushels per acre against our best stuff, because that\u2019s a comparative Corteva versus Corteva, that could be the difference between profit and not. I -- we are not -- like Tim said, we never take it for granted. Our obligation to our farmer customers is to ensure that next year\u2019s hybrids are better than this year\u2019s. And we invest a lot of money in R&D and plant breeding to ensure that happens. But with that comes some credibility in the marketplace, I think. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Your line is open. Frank Mitsch : Hey. Good morning, and congrats, Dave, on your pending retirement. It has been a pleasure working with you. There\u2019s been a lot of discussion, obviously, on CPC volumes and price. The common theme is higher volumes, but lower price. When do you think we might get back to an environment where pricing is flat or perhaps even positive on CPC? Chuck Magro : Yeah, Frank. So I think we\u2019re approaching, I don\u2019t want to give you a quarter because, look, this whole dynamic that we\u2019ve all faced with the destocking is almost unprecedented. And if I provide a quarter, I\u2019m definitely sure I\u2019ll be wrong. But we\u2019re looking at the trend lines and we\u2019re very encouraged at where we\u2019re at. First and foremost, like we said a couple times already today, we did need to see the volume grow and we saw that. And we needed to see the volumes entering the channel and leaving the channel at about the same rate. And thank goodness, on-farm demand has been healthy. I think many of us are now moving the high-priced inventory through the P&L and into the marketplace, which is another important step. And our inventories, Dave, they\u2019re still a little higher than we\u2019d like, but they are a lot better than they have been over the last couple of years. So, when you put all this together, I think we\u2019re on a path of recovery or what we call stabilization. And I probably need to leave the conversation there, because it\u2019s probably not healthy for me to forecast what will happen, except to say that, again, two years of organic decline has happened in the industry, but it is unusual. Three years is even more unusual. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open. And Steve, your line is open. Steve Byrne : Sorry about that. There\u2019s a fair amount of uncertainty out there about whether dicamba will be available in 2025 or at least by early 2025. And I\u2019d like to hear your view on, like, how would you rank the benefits to your business profitability-wise from that risk driving more independent Seed companies to license your Enlist germplasm and corn and soy, which you mentioned is gaining some momentum, Chuck. Is that a bigger benefit to you from such an uncertain outlook for dicamba versus increased shift to your own proprietary brand, your own Pioneer brand in Enlist corn and soy? How would you rank those? Tim Glenn : Hey, Steve. This is Tim. Maybe I\u2019ll take a first shot and let Chuck wrap up there. So, obviously, you know, we\u2019re like everyone else, just kind of eyes open, waiting to see how this is going to turn out. And we did have -- we continue to have very strong adoption on the Enlist E3 side and soybeans. And as we said earlier today, we believe it was greater than 65% of the market, which is a tremendous amount of growth when you think about already being above 55% last year. So do I believe that there\u2019s still room to grow? I really do believe there\u2019s room to grow. It\u2019s hard to size that up based off of the uncertainty around what that label is going to look like. And particularly, the ability to use the product in season, that\u2019s really the, I think the outstanding question there. So in terms of how it shapes up from 2025, I would expect market adoption to expand in 2025. Are there new companies that are going to be in there? Probably not a lot because there\u2019s well over 100 companies that are currently licensed and selling Enlist E3 soybeans today. So I\u2019d say adoption\u2019s pretty wide across the market. It\u2019s just about how much more can the trade continue to penetrate? Depending upon the outcome, certainly our brands will benefit at some level, certainly licensees and others who are distributing products will benefit. And so, to be able to size it up today just with that level of uncertainty probably doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. What I can say is there\u2019s more than likely adequate Seed to support substantial growth on a year-over-year basis between all the 100 plus companies that are producing and currently in the marketplace with Enlist E3 varieties. Chuck Magro : Yeah. I won\u2019t say much more than that on the dicamba. I think Tim covered it well, but if you just look at the strategy that we\u2019ve implemented just a few years ago to be a technology seller instead of a technology buyer, we\u2019re very pleased with that. And you can start to see some of that path to royalty neutrality that hit our bottomline, right? Like over 400 basis points of margin expansion in Seed. This doesn\u2019t happen overnight. This has been a long investment cycle. But if you think about how our soybeans and our corn is performing and we do have the latest in the next-gen technology in the pipeline, as Tim already called out, with Vorceed and PowerCore, and then Enlist E-Series now adding to the mix and becoming more important. And this year we\u2019re over 200 new hybrids and varieties in the marketplace. Next year we\u2019ll be at a similar number. We think that the strength of our Seed business will continue to gain momentum. And then when you think about some of the lower costs and the deflation, as we called it, flowing through the P&L, we just like the path that Seed is on. I think the first half this year was a record, but I think that this business is just getting started. So we\u2019re extremely pleased with the performance of our Seed business right now. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. In your corn product line in the U.S., did doubles grow faster than triples? And you said that your corn royalties were up 40%. Is that a $20 million benefit or $10 million or $30 million? Can you size that? Robert King : So in terms -- maybe I\u2019ll start off and let Dave size up from a financial standpoint. But in terms of our mix, our mix is pretty stable between years. And so we\u2019ve been -- we have had a really strong offer in the past. So, yeah, we\u2019re transitioning to PowerCore, we\u2019re transitioning to Vorceed, but we\u2019ve had a really strong competitive offer up till now. And this is just building off of that. So when you think about it from a between-year standpoint, that mix doesn\u2019t really change a whole lot, sometimes on the margin. But generally, I would say stable. And as we introduce the next level of technology, it\u2019s really more about replacing and upgrading rather than all of a sudden altering that mix. And on the corn licensing side, specifically at the PowerCore and Enlist is where we\u2019re growing. And we\u2019ve been in the marketplace and licensing our genetics with that trade for the last couple of years and we\u2019re starting to see that build. And so Dave, I\u2019ll let you talk about it from a financial standpoint. Dave Anderson : Yeah. So the total -- Jeff, good morning. So the total royalty income referencing the 40%. So that\u2019s not just corn. That\u2019s our total, as Tim said. And what that equates to for us is that about $35 million increase. Hope that helps. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Kristen Owen : Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask about the moving pieces on the free cash flow guidance, since that was held stable, but you did lower the net income outlook. So, if you could just update us with your thoughts on working capital. And while I understand it\u2019s probably too early to say on 2025, just given that the operations puts and takes that you\u2019ve defined already, just help us understand how much of the working capital benefit is being captured 2024 versus 2025? Thank you. Dave Anderson : Sure. So, just quickly, thanks for the question. As you probably saw, we had benefits from both inventory and accounts payable with some offset in receivables in terms of our cash provided by working capital relative to the prior year. So if you will, the change on the change. So inventory was just under $500 billion of benefit, $165 million and accounts payable about $659 million. And then again, we got some offset in accounts receivable and deferred revenue. I think those trends are going to continue. We\u2019re going to see continued benefit in terms of inventory as we sell through, in terms of cost of goods sold and the volume that we forecast for the second half of the year. And the same way with payables is procurement tends to now start to normalize. So we\u2019ll get that benefit. Receivables are going to continue to be a bit of a headwind, particularly with the increase that we\u2019ve got now in volume and revenues in the second half and particularly in the fourth quarter of the year. And when you look at the geographic mix of those revenues. It\u2019s a little early to talk about 2025 with any degree of precision. We\u2019re obviously encouraged by what looks like a 50% free cash flow to EBITDA conversion for this year. We want to sustain that and improve that if possible going into 2025. So, again, that\u2019s something that\u2019s a little early, but we\u2019ll update you on. We\u2019re quite encouraged right now with the way in which cash is shaping up. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez of Mizuho. Your line is open. Edlain Rodriguez : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I mean, Chuck, just wanted to get your insight into Crop Protection, the relationship or if there\u2019s any relationship between volume we\u2019re covering and the pricing pressure that we\u2019re seeing. Like, is there a relationship or will farmers apply the products regardless of pricing so pricing doesn\u2019t dictate what\u2019s going on with volume at all? Chuck Magro : Yeah. Good morning, Edlain. So, look, I think that the dynamic that we\u2019re seeing right now on the farm, you can see the macro agricultural economy margins are tighter than they have been the last couple of years. But farmers are still at least the ones that I\u2019ve spent some time this summer traveling through the Midwest and talking to lots of farmers. Tim and I were talking to a host of Pioneer reps as well this week. What we\u2019re finding is we\u2019ve already talked about the dynamic with Seed. I think with CP, we\u2019re not seeing on any broad basis farmers making decisions based purely on economics. So if a crop needs to be protected in some fashion, they are protecting the crop. But look, given the margins that we have now on the farm, they\u2019re going to make sure that every dollar they spend has the right return on investment. And let\u2019s be clear, right, when they\u2019re investing in Seed or CP, that is a return on investment. What we\u2019re finding though is that, there is a -- if sometimes a farmer will use more of a commodity type product, they have to use that product oftentimes more often because it doesn\u2019t have the same efficacy as some of the newer technologies. So they might buy it for a lower price, but they\u2019re going to use more volume and I think that that is certainly what we\u2019ve seen in some parts of the marketplace. But generally speaking, I think farmers are doing what we would expect them to do in this market. They are prioritizing their investments. They\u2019re ensuring that they\u2019re going to maximize yield because the yield is going to be what they\u2019re going to take and sell into the marketplace and make their returns. So I think that we\u2019re in a market where technology is still going to be important, but we definitely need to ensure that we\u2019re providing farmers with a proper return on investment. And when we look at our CP portfolio, we think that certainly there is a lot that we can do to support farmers in those decisions. Operator : And I will now turn the call back over to Kim Booth. Kim Booth : Okay. So that concludes today\u2019s call. We thank you for joining and for your interest in Corteva. We hope you have a safe and wonderful day. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Corteva Agriscience Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Kim Booth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kim Booth : Good morning and welcome to Corteva\u2019s third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Chuck Magro, Chief Executive Officer, and David Johnson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Tim Glenn, Executive Vice President, Seed Business Unit, and Robert King, Executive Vice President, Crop Protection Business Unit, will join the Q&A session. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks during this call, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of the Corteva website and through the link to our webcast. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are our expectations about the future. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could materially differ from these statements due to these risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those discussed on this call and in the risk factor section of our reports filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Please note, in today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release and related schedules, along with our supplemental financial summary slide deck available on our Investor Relations website. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Magro : Thanks, Kim. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Corteva\u2019s results for the third quarter were largely in line with our expectations. Despite the fact that we had an operating loss in the quarter, we continued to execute well and are on track to deliver over $400 million of savings from our controllables this year. The crop protection business delivered earnings and margin growth, led by demand for our differentiated technology, along with deflation benefits that have just begun. Today we're also providing a first look at 2025. We are expecting to return to double-digit earnings growth, which is largely driven by factors in our control. What continues to set us apart is the strength and leverage of our portfolio, the continued focus on execution, and increased investment in innovation? In what has historically been our smallest quarter due to seed seasonality, we were still able to deliver over $160 million in controllable benefits. Our ability to pull multiple levers to improve overall performance makes us resilient when faced with variables not entirely in our control, including the ongoing crop protection market dynamics and acreage loss from Argentina corn stunts. Overall, the seed business is delivering a strong performance in 2024. From operational excellence perspective, the business drove approximately $175 million in controllable benefits on a year-to-date basis, including royalty improvement and productivity. Our seed business is also set up for continued growth with our pipeline of technology and new hybrids. Pricing gains in most regions, as well as notable share gains in North America, are a testament to the value our technologies provide to farmers. And for 2025, we will roll out several hundred new hybrids and varieties around the world. This is helping farmers increase yield and productivity when they need it the most. On the crop protection side, we're happy to see a second consecutive quarter of volume gains, as well as notable operating EBITDA growth, margin improvement, and the first meaningful tranche of deflation benefits in the third quarter. We remain committed to our strategy of focusing on differentiated and new technologies, which warrant a premium in the market. On a year-to-date basis, we received over 150 crop protection registration approvals, spanning 25 active ingredients in almost 50 countries. And like seed, our CP business is generating substantial value through its focus on controllables, which drove approximately $170 million of benefits in the first nine months of the year. Overall, the ag markets remain mixed. We're still seeing record demand for food and fuel. Farmers continue to prioritize top-tier seed technologies while managing tighter margins. And the crop protection market has turned the corner in every major market, except Brazil, where we are early in the season. It's important to note that underlying farmer demand, in terms of applications, remains on track with historical levels. However, we continue to experience competitive market dynamics and expect that to continue into next year. So what does all this mean for the remainder of the year? We are updating our full-year operating EBITDA range to $3.4 billion at the midpoint to reflect the impact of the current Latin America market conditions that will carry through to our full-year results. However, we are still positioned to achieve approximately 20% for full-year EBITDA margin. This adjustment reflects the latest market realities in Latin America, including expectations for an approximate 20% year-over-year reduction in Argentina's corn-planted area due to corn stunt. It is fair to say that our full-year estimates are assuming a big fourth quarter in Brazil, but this is something we've done before. It's also important to note that we remain committed to free cash flow in the range of $1.5 to $2 billion for the year, as well as $1 billion in share repurchases. Today, we'd also like to provide a first look at how we're thinking about 2025. We'll provide official guidance in early February, but we wanted to give some insights prior to Investor Day. From a macro perspective, we're anticipating a continuation of record demand for grain, oilseeds, meat, and biofuels. On-farm demand is expected to remain steady, and farmers will continue to prioritize top-tier technologies in order to maximize their yields. A farmer's seed selection is particularly critical and is non-discretionary when compared to other crop inputs. In terms of U.S. planted area assumptions, total area planted by farmers in 2025 is expected to be nearly flat year-over-year. It is too early to say too much about Latin America for next year since farmers are in the fields right now planting the 2024-2025 crop in Brazil, which at this time is looking like a mid-single-digit increase for both corn and soybeans. Finally, it's too early to forecast a recovery for corn planted area in Argentina in the 2025 crop year until we see how the current season plays out. Our current view of the crop protection industry is a flattish 2025. It's a dynamic situation that we're monitoring daily, but all major markets are functioning normally except for Brazil, where as I've said, it's early in the season. Brazil remains an attractive market given it is the only geography in the world that is able to materially increase planted area for corn and soybeans. Farmer economic and agronomic benefits incentivize Brazilian soybean farmers to continue to plant corn in rotation. The strategic moves we've made, including investments in biologicals and tilting our portfolio towards differentiated technology, will allow our crop protection business to grow in 2025. When combined with sizable incremental benefits from our controllable levers, an increase in research and development investment and a significant currency headwind, we're anticipating double-digit operating EBITDA growth. So high level, although our top line and bottom line expectations have been impacted by the crop protection industry, our seed business has remained largely on plan and we are expecting to achieve our enterprise goal of 21% to 23% EBITDA margins by 2025. We still have a lot of work to do, but the setup is looking good for 2025. And with that, let me turn it over to David Johnson to review our financial performance. As you know, David joined Corteva just under two months ago and has really hit the ground running as our CFO. I'm happy to have him on our leadership team and I'm impressed with how well he has immersed himself into the organization, which has allowed him, in very short order, to add valuable insights on our business and operations. David, over to you. David Johnson : Thanks, Chuck, and welcome everyone to the call. Let's start on Slide 6, which provides the financial results for the quarter and year-to-date. Briefly touching on the third quarter, organic sales are down 5% compared to prior year with crop protection up 1% and seed down 17%. Pricing for the quarter was down 8%, reflecting the continued competitive pressure in the crop protection industry and end of season settlements in North America seed. Third quarter volume was up 3% over prior year. Seed volumes were down 12%, primarily driven by reduced corn area in Argentina. Crop protection volumes were up 11%, led by Latin America and North America. Volume of new crop protection products and spinosads were both up more than 20% in the quarter compared to prior year. Turning to year-to-date, sales were down 4% versus prior year with flat pricing and lower volume. Seed organic sales were up 1% compared to prior year with pricing up 4% with gains across the portfolio. Seed volumes were down 3% year-to-date, driven by reduced planted area in Argentina, EMEA, and Asia. Crop protection organic sales were down 7% year-to-date with pricing down 5%, primarily driven by competitive market dynamics in Latin America. Crop protection volumes were down 2% with volume gains in Latin America and Asia offset by declines in EMEA, driven by residual destocking and unfavorable weather, and North America driven by just-in-time purchasing behavior. Operating EBITDA of approximately $2.9 billion year-to-date is down 5% compared to prior year. Operating EBITDA margin was 22%, essentially flat compared to prior year. Moving on to Slide 7 for a summary of year-to-date operating EBITDA performance. Seed pricing gains were offset by crop protection pricing pressure, while volume was lower from headwinds in both seed and crop protection. Improvement in net royalties, crop protection, raw material deflation, and productivity actions more than offset cost headwinds from higher seed commodity and other costs. SG&A costs were modestly higher as expected, given the full year ownership of the biological acquisitions and normalized bad debt accruals. R&D expense is in line with expectations on track to be approximately 8% of sales for the full year. With that, let's go to Slide 8 and transition to the updated outlook for the year. The updated full year guidance reflects the current Latin America market dynamics. We now expect net sales to be in a range of $17 billion and $17.2 billion, or down 1% at the midpoint versus prior year. The lower guidance is primarily due to lower than expected planted area in Argentina and dry weather in Brazil, impacting both seed and crop protection. Lower top line growth translates to an updated operating EBITDA range of $3.35 billion and $3.45 billion, up 1% at the midpoint compared to prior year. Driven by the strength of seed performance in the first half of the year and crop protection volume growth and cost improvement second half of the year, operating EBITDA margin expected to be about 20% at the midpoint or about 25 basis points higher than prior year. Operating EPS is now expected to be in a range of $2.50 and $2.60, or down 5% compared to prior year. And finally, we are reaffirming our free cash flow guidance of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, or approximately $1.75 billion at the midpoint, and cash flow to EBITDA conversion rate of 45% to 50% for the full year 2024. With that, let's transition the setup for 2025. As Chuck said, we'll provide formal guidance in early February, but Slide 9 represents a high-level view of our planning framework along with key assumptions that could drive us to the low and high end of our net sales range of $17.3 billion to $17.7 billion and operating EBITDA range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion. In 2025, we expect low single-digit seed pricing driven by demand for yield advantage technology. One of the biggest variables in seed is planted area, both in Latin America and the corn versus soybean split in North America. At the midpoint, we're assuming relatively flat planted area. Another key variable is how much growth we see in crop protection given the current market dynamics. Unharmed demand remains relatively stable. We're expecting the crop protection industry to be mostly flat in 2025. New and differentiated products, including biologicals, are expected to drive much of the volume growth, while prices are expected to remain under pressure. In 2024, we started to see some raw material deflation in crop protection. In 2025, we expect to see more benefit from cross-deflation with improvements in both seed and crop protection coupled with productivity benefits. Our assumptions include SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales to be relatively consistent with 2024 levels. Together, it's a balanced set of assumptions which gives us the confidence in our ability to grow earnings and margin in 2025 for both seed and crop protection. Turning to Slide 10, you can see the operating EBITDA Bridge for 2025 from approximately $3.4 billion in 2024 to $3.8 billion at the midpoint for 2025. Total company pricing expected to be flat to mostly up with low single-digit pricing in seed to be offset by declines in crop protection. We are expecting volume growth in both seed and crop protection. Crop protection volume is expected to be up low to mid-single-digit driven by demand for new products and biologicals. 2025 will be another important step in our journey to royalty neutrality. We expect approximately $50 million improvement in net royalty expense driven almost entirely by increased outlicensing income as we continue to ramp up the licensing of Conkesta E3 soybeans and PowerCore Enlist corn. We expect approximately $400 million of cost improvements in 2025 driven by lower seed commodity costs, crop protection raw material deflation, and productivity actions including benefits from crop protection footprint optimization. SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales are expected to be relatively flat with 2024 levels implying a modest increase in spend. Currency headwind is primarily driven by the Turkish Lira and Brazilian Real. Together, this translates to 12% operating EBITDA growth at the midpoint and more than 180 basis points of margin expansion. With that, go to Slide 11 to review the key drivers of the cost improvements in 2025. For the past several years, we've experienced significant inflation in the seed business driven by higher commodity prices, lower weather-related productivity yields, and higher production costs including inflation on labor, freight, and warehousing. While not all these costs are expected to reverse, we will start to see the benefit from lower commodity costs in 2025 driven largely by North America and Latin America. We expect to see a continuation of this benefit through 2027 given current commodity prices. We expect another year of low single-digit rate of deflation in crop protection raw materials. This is expected to be weighted towards the first half of 2025 based on the year-over-year comparison and our visibility given the roughly six months of crop protection inventory on hand. Both seed and crop protection are expected to deliver productivity savings including a benefit from the crop protection footprint optimization. Together, these benefits translate to approximately $550 million which will be partially offset by inflation of their production costs. These costs include higher freight and labor as well as higher seed production costs related to the transition to seed trade technology in North America. Move on to Slide 12 and summarize the key takeaways. Driven mostly by the current market dynamics in Latin America for both seed and crop protection, we're updating full year guidance and now expect debit debt to be in the $3.4 billion at the midpoint. We remain on track to deliver $1.5 billion to $2 billion of free cash flow and complete $1 billion of share repurchases for full year 2024. We provide a preliminary outlook for 2025 which includes sales, operating EBITDA, and margin growth. And we look forward to the upcoming investor day where we'll give you more detail on our growth outlook from 2025 to 2027. With that, let me turn it over to Kim with a reminder about the upcoming Investor Day. Kim Booth : Thanks, David. As most of you know, we'll be holding our investor day event on November 19th in New York City. It will include a three and a half hour executive webcast with various members of our management team followed by an innovation showcase for those in person. Topics of discussion will include our leading position in the ag tech industry with technology and operational excellence that will drive our financial framework out to 2027 as well as the various growth platforms that will create additional value creation through next decade. If you haven't already registered, information can be found on our investor relations website or please feel free to contact me directly. Now, before we get into Q&A, Chuck, I believe you'd like to make a few closing remarks. Chuck Magro : Yeah, thanks, Kim. We look forward to seeing many of you in New York in a couple of weeks. We have several exciting new announcements regarding the mid and long-term growth trajectory of Corteva. Finally, I'd like to say a few words about the announcement we made a few weeks ago that we will have a new Executive Vice President for our seed business beginning on December 1st. Judd O'Connor will succeed Tim Glenn, who will transition into a strategic advisor role until his retirement in the first quarter. Judd is a 25-year veteran of Corteva and its heritage companies. And is assuming this position after most recently serving as the President of our North American business. Earlier in his career, Judd also served as DuPont's Latin America regional president based out of Sao Paulo. Few people know our customers and business better than Judd, and I'm pleased to have him join our management team. This, of course is certainly bittersweet. However, as Tim is such an institution at Corteva, there are few people anywhere in any company that know agriculture, farming, and our industry better. We will certainly miss him, but wish him all the best in his well-earned retirement. And now I'll hand it back over to Kim. Kim Booth : Thanks, Chuck. Now let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and to the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : Question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Could I ask on Slide 11, that $150 million of inflation and other costs, could you maybe break it down a little bit and give us a sense of how much each of those buckets you mentioned were? And I'm particularly interested in the seed trade transition costs, which I assume are associated with bore seed. But, as I think back to other trade transitions you've done, whether it was to extend -- and then extend to Enlist, which were obviously enormous transitions. I don't remember us talking about very substantial costs. So I'm just wondering if you could give us a little bit more insight into that total $150 million bucket. Thank you. David Johnson : Yeah, so this is David, Vincent. Nice to meet you. When you look at the total, I would say about two-thirds to 75% of that is in the seed business. And then of that, most of it is the trade. And there's about 25% of that number that would be in the inflation bucket. As you can imagine, when you look at our COGS for the seed business, there is a commodity element, but there's a pretty significant element that's non-seed COGS or commodity related, and that's where we're seeing some of the inflation. Chuck Magro : And Vincent, I'll touch a little bit on the trade transition costs as we define them. So, we've got two major corn trade transitions going on in North America right now. One is from Qrome bore seed as you identified, and the other is from some of our heritage of above ground trades into PowerCore Enlist. And so with the trade transition costs, they're going to be something we deal with over the next couple of years. Part of it is just ramping up those new technologies and bringing in those lines. The other part is, as we produce them, we were calling mature in terms of use of sterility and other technologies that we have that are driving a lot of productivity in the field, and because of the pace of the transition here, we're not going to have the level of sterility primarily in the field, and so we're going to have to go back to detasseling and doing some things, incurring some costs associated with that. It's just about the size of those transitions and the costs we have to incur during this period until we're operating at a steady state like we have been for the last several years with AcreMax and Qrome technologies. So it's really something that we'll deal with over the next couple of years and will fade away as we move towards, I'd say, a steady state with those technologies. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joel Jackson : Good morning, everyone. Chuck and team, when I look at your guidance, your first look here at the guidance next year for seed cost deflation and CPC cost deflation, it does seem at a couple hundred million dollar benefit next year, it does seem a little bit low versus what a lot have thought is possible. Can you talk about how you're initially modeling that number for '25? Is this what you have -- you can point to this for sure what we can get? Or is this your base case? Is there more upside? Can you talk about that? Thanks. Chuck Magro : Yeah. Good morning, Joel. So maybe I'll start and then David can give you a bit more specifics. So you're right. We wanted to give a first look at 2025 simply because we're having our Investor Day in a couple of years [ph] where we're going to talk about the framework through '27 and some of the technology opportunities that we believe strongly in beyond 2027, even into the end of the decade and early next. So this is a little early for Corteva to give a view of 2025, but there are reasons for it. Obviously, we'll give official guide like normal in the beginning of February as we release our fourth quarter. And a large part of this, so the takeaways for me on the '25 number is a large part of it is under our control. And we're feeling very good about that. And on a gross basis, it's $600 million really driven by cost management, productivity and there's deflation. And I'd say, David, deflation is about half of that? David Johnson : Correct. Chuck Magro : And then don't forget when we talk about seed deflation because of the way we hedge and we manage that cost. It's going to be a three-year journey for us. And I think we've been as clear as we can be that there's going to be deflationary benefits in seed in '25, in 2026 and 2027. So we're just getting started. In fact, we're seeing higher costs still in the seed COGS right now, but we're seeing deflation finally in CP, which we're pretty excited about. So when you start thinking about that $600 million gross, there are some offsets, which actually, David just covered. You put it all together, double-digit EBITDA growth, margin expansion a strong portfolio lineup. And as Tim just described, Corteva is really strategically shifting now from being what we used to be a technology buyer to now a technology seller, that's the long-term journey that's really exciting for the company. Now we have to bear some costs in order to achieve that. But the framework as well, I think, articulated -- and it's too early for us to really say if it's overly conservative or not. Our view today is this is our best perspective. And don't forget, we are calling for basically the CP market to be essentially flat year-over-year. Anything to add, David? David Johnson : No, I think that's basically good. As Chuck said, about half of that number would be the productivity. The other half would be the cost of goods sold. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Matt Hettwer : This is Matt Hettwer on for Kevin McCarthy. How much seed sales were deferred to 4Q from 3Q? And what's the associated impact on earnings from that deferral? Tim Glenn : So in terms of third quarter seed sales, I assume you're talking primarily on Latin America. So normally, we will have -- I'd say the bulk of Argentinian sales would take place in the third quarter and then would spread into the fourth quarter. And then think about Brazil, we'd have summer that would generally be third quarter and then Safrinha it would be exclusively -- and a little bit of the summer might go into the fourth quarter. Safrinha is generally going to be fourth quarter and then first quarter of the following year is going to catch it in. So as we think about the market this year, that reduction in Argentina is real. We talked about a 20% area reduction. That's a business that isn't deferred. That's business that's gone away. And when we think about what our impact is probably we don't talk about Argentina on every call. I do want to highlight from a seed standpoint, it's a very significant market. It's our third largest seed market in the world actually. And it's actually quite profitable when you look at the margins. And the area that the reduction is taking place, we have an above-average market share approaching 40% of that market. So that business doesn't really come back. That's part of the reduction that we've talked about in terms of the overall year. So I don't think of that as a deferral. And from a summer standpoint in Brazil, we're looking at another area of reduction there. Again, in the big picture, summer represents about 20% or even a little bit less than of the total Brazil corn area, and we're looking at probably 10% or maybe even a little bit greater area reduction this year coming off of a substantial reduction last year. And again, that's not business, that's timing related. So from a Safrinha standpoint, no timing issue that fourth quarter. From an Argentina standpoint and from a Brazil summer, that's essentially volume that won't take place and is part of what we've talked about in terms of the overall reduction of seed area in Latin America. Chuck Magro : Yeah. And maybe just a couple of other thoughts on the overall seed business, if I can. So when I look at the year-to-date performance, we're extremely pleased. I think the seed business is having another extremely strong year. We're seeing market gains in corn and soybeans in North America. I think our EBITDA is up something like 8%. And we have the leading technologies around the world. And I believe our margins are approaching up about 220 basis points. So this is a business that I think the strategic pivot we've made a few years ago is really starting to pay off. As Tim rightly called out, the third quarter is a very slow quarter when it comes to seed sales. And I do think that from an overall perspective, the Argentina Cornstone issue is one of the major drivers we did lower our full year guide. We believe that is a temporary item. In fact, there's some good news when it comes to Argentina and Cornstone. We're hearing some external reports now that the insect that carries that issue, the population is down something like 90%. So we're hoping that the worst will be behind us, but time will tell. But we will do have this impact that will carry through the full year. Operator : Next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you, good morning. Chuck, on royalties -- seed royalties next year, they are down. Why is that? And where do you stand on your journey to royalty neutrality? Thank you. Chuck Magro : Yeah. Maybe I'll give a perspective and then Tim can give you the details, David. But we're feeling really good about our journey to royalty neutrality. If you recall, this is one of the fundamental sort of leading indicators on the shift of our technology focus. We're still on track. I would say we're probably a little ahead maybe a year, maybe two years ahead to deliver royalty neutral by the end of the decade. And if you think about what we've been able to deliver in the last couple of years, we've been run rate about $100 million a year. And this year, in 2024, we're tracking quite a bit ahead of that. So that's one of the reasons why that next year, I think we're right now the preliminary view, and I'll just state that again, it is a preliminary view is slightly less than that. So if you look at '24 combined with '25, we're quite comfortable that we're on that average of about $100 million. But the real important thing isn't necessarily the numbers, it's what we're doing with the technology in terms of Enlist PowerCore, and there's even some good news now in soybeans in Brazil. And maybe, Tim, you want to take a minute to talk about that? Tim Glenn : Yeah. I mean definitely, we talked about the fact that we're largely transitioned the last few years, a lot of our improvement in royalties our royalty position has been because of North America soybeans and the rapid adoption we made over to Enlist E3. We had talked about '25 being more of a transition year. So it's the year when royalty income is actually greater than royalty reduction. And so the dynamics are a little bit different. And as Chuck said, we're -- say we're over delivering a little bit this year, and that's a good thing. You only get to count at once, and we're going to take it this year instead of next year. . As we think about where we go from here, there will still be, I'd say, opportunities for us to reduce royalties as we transition the different technology platforms. And those will be more subtle than what we've seen on the soybean transition in North America. But the big news is going to be about royalty collections. And we're now in the market in North America from a corn standpoint with PowerCore Enlist products being tested by many seed companies and being commercialized, independent seed companies and performance has been outstanding and interest and demand is good. Our challenge is we don't have a full portfolio offering where we sell the aboveground technology. Our next-generation below ground will have the opportunity to license that and that will really improve our position there. But it's a meaningful step forward and another milestone. Obviously, Enlist E3, we've got over 100 licensees out there, and that's some benefit as well. And then Conkesta in Brazil, and that's the other one, Brazil and Argentina with Conkesta E3. We continue to make great progress there. And even though we're still in that call it, single-digit penetration standpoint, we're making progress. And right now, there's over '25, Conkesta E3 varieties in the marketplace with more expected for next year. Adoption is going to continue to accelerate as more varieties come in the market and very competitive varieties at that, plus our own internal breeding program kind of hits its point where we're going to be able to contribute into the licensing market as well beginning in 2025, especially. And I'd say a milestone we have, again, we're still in the early stages there with relatively low penetration, but we do have the first blockbuster -- blockbuster Conkesta E3 variety in Brazil, and we kind of measure that as varieties that crossed that 1 million unit of sales, variety called Torrento CE, which was developed by one of our key breeding partners produced and sold by many multipliers. It's widely planted by growers, and it crossed over 1 million units this past year. And I think it's one of eight varieties in the marketplace. So small step. We've got a long way to go. And certainly, as we get to the latter part of the decade, it's going to continue to accelerate. But what it shows is we've got to fit in the marketplace. We're in the game, and this is a big market that opens up for us as we go forward. So exciting part going forward, less about royalty reduction, really more about royalty collection as the future. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Christopher Parkinson : Great, thank you so much. Just circling back to Slide 10 in terms of your EBIT outlook. Obviously, there are a lot of moving parts, and I think it's safe to say, at least in my opinion, there's some upside to a lot of the positives. But just in terms of the deductions, referring specifically to currency, the SG&A and R&D as a percent of sales, just kind of trying to isolate those factors along with the prospect of lower acreage in the U.S. and CPC price. As you sit here today in terms of the, let's say, the offsets to the plethora of positives, there are we confident that, that FX is going to be stagnant at the $150 million? Are we confident that CPC pricing is more of a one half just kind of marking to market what we've seen in the second half and extending that into 2025? Are there any other risks that the buy-side community should really be factoring in? Or do we feel good about that and just kind of are sitting back to see how much of the upside scenario should actually play itself out? Thank you. David Johnson : Hey, Chris, this is David. Maybe I'll take the currency question, then maybe we'll pass it on to Chuck regarding the other elements. If you look at the currency right now, most of that is in Brazil. And as you know, we're kind of in the upper-5s as far as where the Real is trading at currently. This year, our base was somewhere just south of 5.2%. So it's hard to really predict whether or not that will fight further or not. An average year, I think it's somewhere around 8% if you look over the long period of time. So I think we've have a reasonable estimate of what we think the impact will be. I never say never if it goes further give valuation, but I think we feel really comfortable with this number. Chuck Magro : Yeah. Maybe, Chris, just a couple of thoughts. Why don't we just take the bookends? So you'll probably notice that the 3.6% to 4% is wider than we normally provide. We did that because we're providing it earlier. And if you take the low end, the 3.6%, perhaps that is on the conservative side. The only time will tell. But we would certainly agree that a lot would have to be different than our current assumptions. . Now we're providing the '25 first look, as we said, because of our Investor Day, and what would need to happen, we believe, for that 3.6% to become a reality is we would have to face some pretty significant additional headwinds, right? Most likely continued CP market weakness and we would probably have to miss on some of our cost and productivity deliverables, which as you know, we have a very good track record again. Let's take the other end, $4 billion. As I said, it is a wider range. What would have to happen for us to hit $4 billion? We certainly think that $4 billion is on the table or we wouldn't have put it out there and very achievable. It would probably take us to overachieve on our deliverables, on our controllables, which we have a history of doing. But I think we'd also need to see a little bit of strength in the CP market. Is that possible? Absolutely. But it's a little early to get overly bullish when we're sitting in the -- just in the fourth quarter right now, trying to finish up 2024. I think the important thing for folks to draw their attention to is, as a first look for 2025, my callout is double-digit earnings growth and margin expansion, a continuation of a journey that we've been on for five years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Spector with UBS. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is [indiscernible] on for Josh. Just wanted to clarify your expectations there on the crop chem side. So for 2025, you noted that volumes are sort of stabilizing and then ongoing risk on the pricing side. Your guide seems to imply sort of mid-single-digit volume growth offset by pricing down low single digits. Is that correct and sales would sort of grow low single digits overall? Or can you walk us through kind of what's baked in there? Thanks. Chuck Magro : Yeah. So let me try to hit the highlights here for you. I think -- when I think about the CP market, the third quarter, I think, took another positive step towards full stabilization of this industry. We're not out of the woods yet, but we like what we saw in the third quarter. And when you step back and you think about that, North America is actually seeing some strength. I'd say Europe and APAC are operating normally. Brazil is still, I think, one of the most unstable markets that we're operating in right now when it comes to CP. And there's a combination of reasons, right? It was really dry. So there was a weather impact. It is a well-supplied market, and there's cautious farming behavior still in this market. So when you put that all together, I think we're cautiously optimistic that the CP industry is starting to reach some stability. Now let's talk about our business. So the last couple of years have been tough for the industry. Nobody will say anything different than that. We feel that our business has performed quite well. In the third quarter, I'd say, for our CP business had a pretty good quarter. We saw the second consecutive quarter of volume growth, which is really to your question. And then we saw EBITDA growth for the first time in a year, over 30% EBITDA growth in our CP business. And some of that is deflation. A lot of that is what's in our control and our new technology. So the look for 2025 then, just to get specific now is if our assumption is a flattish industry, we'll do better than that. And it will be really driven by, I think, volume growth in the, I'd say, mid-single digits. And it's driven by our new technology. We have several new AIs that are still ramping up, but the biological investments we've made. But the overall market is healthy. It's certainly healthier than it has been. And I think yet you'll see that our CP business grow at probably better than that in 2025. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Hey, good morning. And nice to meet you telephonically, David. Just a question on Slide 17. North American seed price was down 25% year-over-year. That reflects end-of-season settlements. It seems like -- seems like an outlier. I was wondering if you could provide any more color on that. Tim Glenn : Hey, Frank, good morning. This is Tim. I'll take a shot at that. And obviously, our business in North America is largely in the first half of the year. There's a very limited amount of that first half business that sometimes can trickle into the third quarter. And we just don't have a huge amount of business to kind of buffer some of these things. So when we talk about settlement issues, what we're talking about here is in the case of replants. And so replants are a normal part of the business. We factored into our equation. Its part of the terms of trade we have, service policy we have for farmers. And every year, we accrue for replants, and sometimes they hit early, sometimes they hit less. Sometimes they have a little bit more. This year, actually, we're -- from the amount of replants we've had, it's very much in the normal range. So we had planned for it, just hit a little bit later. And so it showed up in the third quarter rather than the second quarter. So it's quite visible this year. And why that is, if you think about the planning progress and some of the early season floods that we had, particularly in the northern corn belt in the Northwest Iowa, Southern Minnesota. We ended up with a little bit of elevated replants versus a year ago, and they were a little bit later just in terms of the settlement standpoint. So it's not -- shows up as a price concession. And obviously, there's not a lot of volume that takes place there that kind of buffers it. And so it's quite visible there. And it looks unusual. It's actually a normal part of the business. It just doesn't oftentimes hit by itself in a quarter as it did here. So that's kind of a little background on what the issue is. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. This is [indiscernible] filling in for Steve. So I want to check a little bit on the pricing environment for crop chemicals and especially in Brazil, where the price was down 18% and -- if you can talk a little bit about that and why is it deteriorating so rapidly? Is it that you're trying to regain share? Is it the threat of imports and generics? And at the same time, I think one of your competitors was talking about they were actually later in the game trying to regain share by lowering their price. And everybody has already done. So it doesn't seem like that's the case actually. And what do you think your competitors are doing now? Will they have to respond to your price declines? Or are you the last one to, I guess, cut price? Robert King : Hi, this is Robert. I'll touch a little bit on this. Specific to Brazil and price, let me start with the Crop Protection. We finished up the quarter down 10% on price. But if you look at year-to-date, we're in the mid-single digits. And so third quarter was -- is a different period for us. Lots of things going on to get ready for the season and working with the channel on some different things. Brazil was down about 18% for the quarter. But we're going to finish up the year back to that mid-single digits for the company. We don't expect a sequential quarter over quarter or quarter two quarter, the pricing will be relatively flat. And when you think about why, there's a lot of competition going on in Brazil. And in a flat market or a flat to down market. Really, we're looking at this year. A lot of competition for volume coming from all areas, trying to find growth. And so we play. We're trying to hold share. We do the things we need to do that makes sense for our products. I'm not going to comment on what our competition does or doesn't do or their philosophy. But for us, we're going to continue to work on selling the things that are going to drive value for our business, and that really comes back around our new products and our differentiated products. That's the majority of our growth happening in Q4 and on into the future, you will have seen that these products typically have a premium because of the value that they add on farm. And they're going to continue to grow as well as our biologicals in Brazil. You'll recall that well over 50% of our overall biological business is in Brazil. And so that season is still to happen. And we expect a good quarter out of biologicals down there as well. So short answer is we'll finish up in the mid-single digits for price down for the year, which is about where we're trending overall for the business right now. Chuck Magro : Maybe, Robert, one other thing to add. When you look at our order book for the fourth quarter, we like our position. We're certainly -- we're north of 50% for our CP book over 60%, 65% for our biologicals book. So we're setting up exactly where we want to be for the fourth quarter. And I think that's all factored into our current thinking. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Please go ahead. Patrick Cunningham : Hi, good morning. Just based on the last comments, could you help quantify how new products and biologicals have performed year-to-date? And what do you expect for contribution in 2025? And should the sensitivity around that number be similar to what you're expecting for broader crop protection? Robert King : Patrick, this is Robert. I'll start with biologicals. We're 15 months into the acquisition, and this business continues to perform very well. It's serving -- the portfolio is serving as a very good complement to our synthetics business. And it's driving solutions on the farm that we're able to offer to the farmer that's unique to us. So we like how it's playing out. From an overall for the 2024, we're expecting biologicals to be up double digits EBITDA growth for the year. And so that's going to continue to give us strength. And when you lay that into new products, Q3, we saw about a 20% volume or organic growth in new products. And so these products continue to be -- to perform above market. We expect about mid-single digits growth for the year, and we're continuing to get value out of that. So we're going to finish up the year strong with both of these as we finish out Q4. Chuck Magro : And then when you think about 2025 and beyond, and we'll have more to share, of course, at the Investor Day, but these are the, I think, the growth engines of our CP business, right? Because if you think through the strategy, we're trying to deemphasize the commodity part of the portfolio, really sell differentiated technology. We believe we've got strong channels to market. And so these will lead, I think, the growth in terms of volume. They will have a premium, as Robert called out. They're not immune to the market. They'll trade with the market, but they'll always have a premium or less differentiated technology. And we have -- even this year so far, we've had very good demand from a volume perspective on our spinosad franchise on our new products and on the biologicals that will carry into '25 and beyond. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Edlain Rodriguez : Thank you, good morning everyone. Just a quick question on -- again, on the guidance initial outcome in view for 2025. You've talked about the skew between the low end and high end. But when will you get a better sense of which way the pendulum is swinging. And related to that also is again, with all due respect, this is the third time, I think you've lowered your guidance for the year for 2024. And of course, Ag could be very challenging to forecast. The question is like do you think it's fair for people to be asking what gives you confidence and how much confidence should we have in that guidance that you gave for 2025? Chuck Magro : Yeah. Good morning, Edlain. Fair question. Absolutely. And if you think about this, right, so we had a '25 framework that we did update earlier this year, and I believe the range was something like 3.90 to 4.15 mid with margins in that 21% to 23%. And at that point, the reason we had updated that is because our fundamental view on the CP industry had changed, right? We had thought at that point now that the CP industry for 2024 would be in decline. And we've always said that for us to hit certainly the numbers for 2025, we would need to see a return for the industry to grow in the year 2025. And today, we came out with our view that it's going to be flattish. So that's the fundamental change. So if you look at the seed business, it's actually almost entirely on plan. And in fact, it's probably trending a little bit ahead. And we are also ahead when it comes to cost productivity. So when I think about how we've done as a company, we've got a lot of things right. The seed business is on plan. I think our cost and productivity and our controllables are, but the CP industry has clearly moved against us and everybody else in the industry, and that's had a profound impact on our outlook. So to your question, how about 3.6 now to 4, 3.8? Our view is still founded on a flat 2025 when it comes to CP. And when will we know? Let's get through this year. We've got a crop to harvest and a crop to put in the ground in Latin America. But we're feeling very good that the seed business is going to continue its journey. The $600 million of gross cost productivity and deflation, I think we're feeling very, very comfortable with. And as I mentioned, we're getting more comfortable that the CP industry is finding some stability finally. So it is, I think, a very fair question to ask. All we can do as an organization though is give you what we're thinking and to update you as we learn more. And this is our current view is that the CP industry, if it's flat, will be somewhere between the 3.6% and the 4%. And we're feeling very good about the levers that we have to pull to create value. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov : Good morning everyone. What did you assume for Argentina planting '25, do you assume any meaningful return on [indiscernible]? Tim Glenn : Alex, this is Tim. I'll take a shot at that. So we're taking out 20%, so call it from roughly 8 million hectares down to 6.5 million hectares. And for '25 at this point, we're taking a very, let's say, a prudent approach and not assuming a significant increase or return. And why that is, is because of the pressure from the leaf hoppers last year. It's a really difficult environment for farmers to plant into. And it's hard to predict whether that was a one-year deal or if it's something that we're going to have to deal with going forward. . And so Chuck share that right now, the populations are moving in the right direction. So that's obviously a positive thing, but we got to track that over the course of the season. Last year, we saw populations really build as you got into the January, February time frame. And so it's going to be really important that we understand before we assume some kind of a big rebound. Hard to do it. It'd be very speculative at this point in time. Bottom line is Argentina is going to remain an important production area for both corn and soybeans. Argentina is one of the three major exporters of corn, and we'll continue to do that. And from an agronomic standpoint, farmers need to be planning corn in that northern area because that rotation between corn and beans is really important. They plant bean this year as a defensive crop on a one-year basis, but you can't do that for three or four years. They're going to end up with some problems. So we're optimistic over the next few years. And for '25, we're assuming essentially a flat market again with '24 and certainly, we're going to be staying close to understand what that opportunity is. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks for taking my question. I'll just ask real quickly on the balance sheet. If you guys would consider maybe taking on a little bit of debt. I know that obviously, interest rates would play into that, but maybe you can just give us some updated thoughts on your views there? Thanks. Tim Glenn : I think as we sit here today, our views have been consistent. I think when you look at the amount of cash that we generate, the amount that we put back in the business versus giving back in dividends and buybacks. We don't see any meaningful change going forward, certainly not in the '25 outlook, and not in the '25 to '27 outlook. Chuck Magro : Yeah. And Arun, maybe just a couple of other thoughts. So feeling good about the guide in terms of free cash flow, $1.5 billion to $2 billion. So the company is generating, I think, very good cash and the conversion is improving from EBITDA. We do recognize we have a strategic asset in our balance sheet, investment-grade rating. I think David just shared our philosophy really hasn't changed. If you think through even this year, we're going to be approximately $1.5 billion of returning capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. So that's a big number. We want to be able to invest for growth inside the business. And we've got, I think, a lot of great things happening both in the seed and CP portfolio. And we've got a few other things that we'd like to share with you at the Investor Day. So we'll hold the rest of the conversation. But it is a good position to have, and I think it is one of the things that sets Corteva apart. Operator : That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Kim Booth for closing remarks. Kim Booth : Great. That concludes today's call. We thank you for joining and for your interest in Corteva.

Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release and related schedules, along with our supplemental financial summary slide deck, available on our Investor Relations website. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Chuck. Chuck Magro : Thanks, Kim. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I hope your year is off to a great start. There are several key points I'd like to share with you today, including a perspective on our Q4 results, an overview of current market fundamentals, with a closer look at what that might mean for us in 2025, and how to connect all of that to our 2027 financial framework. That outlines our path to sustained value creation over the next three years. Let me start by saying we finished 2024 almost exactly as we thought we would. The Ag fundamentals have continued to improve, more so than over the past two years. So our 2025 guidance reflects that. Our portfolio of advanced seed and crop protection technologies is in high demand, and we feel good about our path to delivering the 2027 financial framework which we announced in November. Coupled with productivity and cost improvement initiatives, a central pillar of our business strategy, we delivered 20% operating EBITDA margins for the first time in 2024. All while maintaining operating EBITDA which ended up being about flat year over year in less than ideal market conditions. To ensure we had good momentum coming into 2025, it was important that we finish the year strong. Which we did. Particularly in crop protection where we drove double-digit organic sales growth and 800 basis points of margin improvement in the fourth quarter. Which was largely attributable to demand for our technology in Brazil. Our seed business consistently delivered in 2024, with Pioneer maintaining its rank as the number one corn and soybean brand in the US. We gained corn market share in North America, coupled with solid pricing. This was quite an accomplishment given the reduction in corn planted area. In Enlist E3 soybeans, the number one selling soybean technology in the US has reached 65% market penetration. Thanks to so many other companies licensing Enlist traits for their own products. The Enlist system, including our herbicide offerings, reached $1.9 billion in sales in 2024. Still growing despite a well-supplied market. On the crop protection side, new products in Spinozan delivered double-digit volume gains in 2024, and on biologicals, mid-single-digit volume increases in 2024 are expected to continue to strengthen in 2025 due to ongoing demand recovery and continued penetration across all regions. Between strong demand for our innovative seed technology, cost and working capital discipline, as well as healthier farmer income levels in North America, our operating free cash flow in 2024 improved by almost $500 million, coming in at about $1.7 billion. We also returned approximately $1.5 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases for the full year. We are committing to another $1 billion in share repurchases in 2025. So in summary, 2024 was a year of progress in less than ideal conditions. Seed continues to deliver great growth as we transition to a net technology seller. And although the crop protection industry had another down year, the strength of our portfolio in our fourth quarter performance in Brazil gives us confidence that things are moving in the right direction. Now let's take a step back to discuss the current macro environment before diving into the specifics for Corteva, Inc. in 2025. As I mentioned, overall ag fundamentals remain constructive. As evidenced by record global consumption of both corn and soybeans. Large global crops enjoyed record demand for grains, oilseeds, and biofuels in 2024, and the demand outlook in 2025 indicates that growth will continue for livestock feed, biofuel, and food consumption. Strong production has helped farm sector income. We had record corn yields in the US and expect to see the same in Brazil. Which allows farmer margins in both of those key markets to improve meaningfully. While grain prices are on the rebound, and US farmers posted back-to-back record corn yields for the past two years, more notable is the fact that the corn market is tight. Measured by global stocks-to-use ratios, it's the tightest it's been globally in over a decade. And if you exclude China, it's the tightest we've seen in three decades. And with on-farm demand remaining strong overall, we're seeing signs of stabilization in the crop protection industry. For example, pricing for products coming out of China has been stable over the past few months, and channel inventory levels around the world are more in balance. For Corteva, Inc., improvement has come in the shape of three consecutive quarters of volume gains. This all gives us confidence in our 2025 assumption of a flattish market with low single-digit volume gains. Offset by low single-digit pricing headwinds. With regard to 2025, although our operational plan remains intact, today, we are refining our preliminary 2025 view to reflect additional currency headwinds. Namely the Brazilian real and to a lesser extent, the Canadian dollar. The strong US dollar will impact some agricultural economies throughout 2025. And due to the crops and geographies in which we participate, will impact our US dollar reported results. However, we are still expecting another year of top and bottom-line growth and meaningful margin expansion with continued laser focus on controllables including the initial tranche of seed cost deflation. You might recall that in our third quarter earnings call, we pointed to $550 million in gross cost and sales improvements in 2025. And that assumption remains. Benefits from our self-help actions, including an additional $50 million related to royalty improvement, give us the ability to continue to invest in R&D and future innovation. Our plan reflects about 10% EBITDA growth and about 100 basis points of margin improvement. We foresee another year of strong cash flow generation and plan to execute $1 billion in share repurchases over the course of 2025. Now let's spend a few minutes on key themes and market assumptions for this year. To set the stage, think about strong demand for crops, improving farmer margins, good on-farm demand for seed and crop protection, and more corn area in the US. The farmer is responding to positive relative economics. And 2025 is setting up to be the year of corn in the ag markets. We expect our seed business to have another strong year as farmers continue to look to effective technology to boost yields while offsetting the impact of volatile weather and increasing pest pressures. It should also be a standout year for seed margin improvement driven by mix uplifts, royalty income improvements, and cost of sales benefits, including productivity and deflation. We plan to launch another 300 new seed hybrids and varieties. Our seed pipeline is the best in the industry. The incremental yields from the advanced technologies in our portfolio allow us to continue our long-standing price-for-value strategy. Our strategy of selling technology is visible in the opportunity set there is significant. The big question is what assumptions did we make for crop protection? Well, the short answer is that the midpoint of our range assumes a flattish CP market. We have seen volume trending in the right direction. It comes down to when the pricing environment will stabilize. Given what we know today, this seems to be the most reasonable assumption for the time being, and we'll continue to update the market as conditions evolve. For our crop protection business, we're expecting mid-single-digit organic sales growth overall. Led by new products in Spinozan's as well as biologicals double-digit growth. If you recall, targeting $1 billion in biological revenue by the end of the decade. Geographically, Brazil will remain a key growth market for us in 2025, for both businesses. On top of our existing strong corn market share, it will be another important year for us to continue to make inroads with Concessa on the soybean side. And for crop protection, we have a robust plan for more biologicals and strengthening our commercial presence. Before I turn the call over to David, let me remind you about the announcements we made at our November Investor Day where we introduced a new straightforward framework to create value through 2027. Recall, we're targeting $1 billion in incremental net revenues over the 2025 to 2027 period. From three growth platforms. Increased out-licensing income, continued ramp-up of CP products, and biological growth. We're making investments in other growth areas but these are the three that will provide the most significant incremental value capture in the midterm. Second, we laid out phase two of our controlling the controllables program that entails $1 billion in gross productivity, cost, and deflation benefits across seed and crop protection. As well as managing SG&A. Next, as part of our ongoing commitment to commercial execution, we're targeting about 100 basis points of EBITDA margin growth per year. That works out to be over 900 basis points of improvement versus where we began in 2019. So if you play all this forward to 2027, we're expecting EBITDA growth of $1 billion over three years, which is a 9% CAGR with EBITDA margins of 23% to 24% at the midpoint. We are energized by this plan and our first task is to execute a strong 2025. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David. David Johnson : Thanks, Chuck, and welcome everyone to the call. Let's start on Slide seven, which provides the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year. Briefly touching on the fourth quarter, organic sales were up 13% compared to the prior year with seed up 16%, and crop protection up 11%. Pricing for the core was down 4% as expected largely driven by competitive pressure in Brazil, in both seed and crop protection. Pricing was positive in every region excluding Latin America. Fourth quarter volume was up 17% over the prior year. Seed volumes were up 19% driven by an expected increase in Brazil's safrinha corn area. Crop protection volumes were up 16% led by Latin America and EMEA. Volume of crop protection new products were up more than 20% in the quarter compared to the prior year. Full year 2024 organic sales were up 1% versus the prior year. With higher volume partially offset by lower price. Seed organic sales were up 4% for the year, with pricing up 3% with gains across the portfolio. Volume was up 1% with planted area increases in Brazil corn and North America soybean. Offsetting lower corn planted area in North America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. Crop Protection organic sales were down 2% versus the prior year. With volume gains offset by price decline. Full year price was down 5% largely driven by competitive market dynamics in Latin America. Crop protection volume was up 3% with gains in Latin America and Asia Pacific partially offset by declines in EMEA, driven by residual destocking and unfavorable weather. In North America, driven by just-in-time purchasing behavior. Operating EBITDA of approximately $3.4 billion for the full year 2024 is essentially flat versus the prior year. With an operating EBITDA margin of 20% or more than 30 basis points higher. Moving on to Slide eight for a summary of the full year operating EBITDA performance. Seed price gains were offset by lower prices in crop protection, while volume was higher in both seed and crop protection, led by Latin America on higher expected planted area and demand for new products. Transitioning to cost, we delivered nearly $500 million in self-help benefits with $155 million in lower net royalty expense, and $220 million benefit from raw material deflation and productivity actions. These gross cost benefits more than offset cost headwinds from higher seed commodity and other costs. SG&A costs were modestly higher as expected given the full year ownership of the biological acquisitions and normalized bad debt levels. R&D expense was in line with expectations and December 8% of sales for the full year. Together, this translates to 20% operating EBITDA margin which is impressive given the market dynamics. With that, let's go to slide nine. In transition to the guidance for 2025, and the key metrics which we are tracking. We provided an early view of 2025 back in November that based on 2024 results, and the stronger US dollar, we are updating the guidance ranges. 2025 operating EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion or approximately 10% improvement over the prior year at the midpoint. Meaningful margin expansion is expected to be driven by price, and product mix, together with benefits from improved net royalty expense, cost inflation, and productivity actions. Operating EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.95 per share. An increase of 10% at the midpoint which reflects higher earnings growth and lower average share count. Partially offset by higher net interest expense. Free cash flow to EBITDA conversion rate is expected to be in the range of 40% and 45% which is in line with the 2023 and 2024 average. The change from 2024 is driven by higher earnings, offset by normalized use of working capital. Turning to Slide ten, you can see operating EBITDA bridge for 2025 growing from approximately $3.4 billion in 2024 to $3.7 billion at the midpoint for 2025. Total company pricing is expected to be flat to up below single digits with pricing gains in seed, partially offset by declines in crop protection. Chuck Magro : While crop protection prices are beginning to stabilize, David Johnson : we still expect prices to be down low single digits for the year in 2025. We're expecting volume growth in both seed and crop protection. Seed volume gains are expected to be driven by more corn acres in North America, and share gains in key markets. Crop protection volume is expected to be up mid-single digits driven by demand for new products and biologicals, which are expected to outperform the rest of the portfolio. We expect approximately $50 million improvement in net royalty expense driven by increased out-licensing income, as we continue to ramp up the licensing of Concessa E3 soybeans, and Paracort and Enlist corn. We are on track to deliver approximately $400 million of net cost improvements in 2025 driven by lower seed commodity costs, crop protection raw material deflation, and productivity gains including benefits from crop protection footprint optimization. Kim Booth : SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales David Johnson : are expected to be relatively flat with 2024 levels. Implying a modest increase in spend. Like many US-based reporting companies, we are expecting a larger currency headwind now than we previously forecasted. The currency headwind is largely driven by the Brazilian real, Turkish lira, and Canadian dollar. A stronger US dollar is expected to translate to a low single-digit headwind on net sales and approximately $275 million headwind on operating EBITDA. Together, this translates to approximately 10% operating EBITDA growth at the midpoint. And 100 to 150 basis points of margin expansion. Regarding the timing of sales and earnings in 2025, we're expecting about 60% of sales and roughly 80% of EBITDA to be delivered in the first half of the year. We also expect to see a timing difference between the first two quarters versus the prior year. This is largely due to the timing of seed deliveries in Latin America and EMEA after both regions delivered record volume in the fourth quarter of 2024. For the first quarter of 2025, we're assuming a normal delivery pattern in the Northern Hemisphere which could shift significantly between the first and second quarters depending on weather conditions. Let's go to slide eleven. Which presents the factors which could drive the guidance to the lower and upper end of the range. As seen on the previous slide, our current forecast includes a significant currency headwind to operating EBITDA. We will continue to look for opportunities to mitigate additional through pricing and other means. If the dollar continues to strengthen, we expect there would be some additional headwind. Assumed in the midpoint, is relatively flat global planted area, with increased corn area in North America, low single-digit increase in Brazil safrinha, and relatively flat area in other regions. A big question is how much growth we'll see in crop protection given the current market dynamics. On-farm demand remains relatively stable and we're expecting the traditional crop protection market to be essentially flat in 2025. Corteva, Inc.'s new products and biologicals are expected to drive much of the volume growth while prices across the portfolio are expected to remain under pressure although at a lower level than the prior year. We expect to deliver meaningful cost improvements in seed and crop protection from input cost inflation and productivity action. And that our midpoint assumption includes SG&A and R&D as a percentage of sales to be relatively consistent with 2024 levels. We're not considering any impacts from trade policy in the midpoint of guidance. Without details on scope, duration, or affected industries, it's too premature to provide details about the potential impacts. This situation is very fluid, and changes daily. So we will continue to evaluate the impact as specifics become known. Together, these are a balanced set of assumptions which gives us confidence in our ability to grow sales and operating EBITDA in 2025. With that, let's go to slide twelve and summarize the key takeaways. First, Q4 operating EBITDA online with expectations as a record performance for the company. Crop Protection fourth quarter results including double-digit volume growth and significant operating EBITDA margin expansion is a positive sign our portfolio strategy is working and the industry is starting to stabilize. The strength of our seed portfolio drove full-year sales and EBITDA growth for the business through price and mix improvement, market share gains, and a meaningful improvement in net royalty expense. And driven by working capital, we delivered $1.7 billion in free cash flow. A 50% conversion rate on EBITDA. Balance sheet flexibility and ability to generate cash supports our track record of returning cash to shareholders. Including $1.5 billion in 2024. Finally, the 2025 guidance that we shared today reflects sales, earnings, and margin growth, much of which is in our control and supports the three-year framework we presented in November. With that, let me turn it back to Kim. Kim Booth : Thanks, David. Let's move on to your questions. I would like to remind you that our cautions on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. I would like to remind everyone to limit yourselves to one question only. Should you have a question, should you wish to withdraw, please press star one again. If you are using a speakerphone, please state the handset before pressing any keys. Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson from Wolfe Research. Go ahead. Christopher Parkinson : Great. Thank you so much. You know, a lot's changed since November outside of FX. Specifically new seed business. You know, we're looking at corn acres likely being up versus probably flattish back then. It seems like you have an opportunity a further opportunity, quite frankly, on the versus two four g debacle. PowerCore seems to be doing well pricing. I mean, we could keep going, but just how should we think about these potential positives as they're evolving into the season versus what you've been highlighting as a risk on FX side as we just try to triangulate the midpoint of your guidance and how you see things evolving. Thank you so much. Chuck Magro : Morning, Chris. Well, how about we do this? We'll talk about our assumption for guide. I'll give you some views on the market and then David can walk you through the upsides and downsides. At least how we're thinking about them today. So you're right. From a fundamentals perspective, the market has turned more positive certainly in the last three months. We've always in the last couple of years, we've seen very good demand for crops. 2024 was another record. We're expecting very good demand in 2025. I think crop prices are following that trend. You can see it especially in corn and soybeans where they're off their bottoms and showing I'd say, some modest strength. And the stocks-to-use ratios, especially for corn, is the tightest we've seen in some time. That's why we're calling, I think, this year, the year of corn because we just think that the market is calling for a more planted area when it comes to corn. Farmer margins are improving. They're not great by any stretch, but they are much better than they were last year. And that comment is for US farmers and for Brazilian farmers. And then just one other comment. You sent through the CP industry. It's a different state what we're in right now. The last couple of years have been very challenging, and I'd say disproportionately imbalanced when it comes to inventories in the channel. And things are feeling a lot better in that regard where we have more balanced inventories around the world. There's still pockets. We're still expecting downward pressure in price. Especially in the first half of the year. But the CP industry is continuing its recovery. So all of that was factored into sort of our midpoint and how we're thinking about guide. And, David, maybe you can now talk a little bit about the upsides and downsides. David Johnson : Yeah, Chris. So thank you very much for the question. Yeah. I think we outlined them. Pretty decently on slide eleven. You know, as we feel we have a balanced outlook for currency at this point in time. However, if there is a situation where the weaker US dollar then we would see some upside. I think for us, probably, you know, one of the big pluses and minuses is well, it's just the CP industry in general, which we talked about. We expect some low single-digit negative pricing in the CP business this year in 2025. Which is a pretty significant improvement over what we saw in 2024. But that to me is one of the key lookouts for this year. Also have a net $400 million of improvement due to self-help actions. You know, that takes execution and so on and so forth with the teams. We feel, again, that's balanced. So think when you look at the total 10% you know, midpoint EBITDA growth, we feel like at this point, it's a balanced set of assumptions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Hi, everyone. When I look at Q4, what stands out to me is it looks like the production cost in crop chem or crop protection came in a lot lower than certainly we were expecting, and I'm wondering if it was a lot lower than what you guided. You don't really guide by segment. At the same time, you know, it looks like the seed production costs were reported a lot higher than what we were expecting. And so I'm just wondering if you can speak to sort of where you are in CP from a lower raw material cost perspective and if you are indeed run rating better than you thought, you know, three, five months ago, and if there are any implications, to 2025 from that, and, likewise, I assume in seed, know, I know we know you were working through some higher cost inventory, and so that's just temporal and, hopefully, will run its course. But I just would like to get some commentary around where you are ex 2024 on the cost side of the equation. Chuck Magro : Okay. Good morning, Vincent. So let me give you some opening comments then I'll turn it over to both Robert and Judd to talk specifics. So you're right when it comes to CP. As you probably remember, we've got a multiyear plan where we're really looking at structural improvements, asset footprint, really doing things differently when it comes to CP driving significant productivity gains. Recall that as a publicly traded company back in 2019, we inherited our footprint. And we've been on a very long journey here to optimize and take structural costs out. And Robert King and his team have done a really good job. And I'd say we are trending a little ahead of a plan there, and he can give you some specifics. The other side of this is seed. And we had telegraphed this before a couple of times that we had some very high-cost inventory in Latin America. Really because of lower yields and quality issues back in 2023. And we made a deliberate set of decisions to clear the decks for 2025. And we've done that, and that obviously shows up in our 2024 results. But to give you just a bit more color, Robert, why don't you start with where you're at in the cost reduction program. Then we'll pitch it over to Judd. Robert King : Good. Thanks, Chuck. Vincent, we finished out the year to answer your question about where we expected to be on our journey to our 2027 commitments, looking at the cost takeout and the footprint reductions we talked about, everything is on track. For the full year. For 2025, you know, we're gonna take out another $200 million in if you recall it, Investor Day in November, we committed to a $300 million run rate by 2027 at least. And so we are marching towards that. Think about raw material deflation. And it came in for the year, you know, right about $100 million, which is what we had expected. And we said last time we talked, and that will continue into the next year. We have a good line of sight that it is all baked into what we've guided towards. And so we think it continues to move forward, continuing to get better. Things will slow at a lower rate than what we've seen in the past. But everything's moving in the direction of goodness from a cost management standpoint there. Chuck Magro : Judd? Judd O'Connor: Yeah, Vincent. Thank you. And I think Chuck wrapped it up pretty well. If you look across the world, we had price gains in every region with the exception of Latin America in the fourth quarter. Latin America, we had extremely competitive markets. That continued in the fourth quarter. Also had some remaining high-cost inventory that we had to work through. I think we've talked about that in a number of cases in the past. For 2025, the good news is both get better. We've got a COGS position in Brazil in particular that's going to materially improve. And we see a pricing opportunity as we go into 2025. So it feels like we've worked through what was a challenging 2024, and we've got a good path in 2025 in the plan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital. Joel Jackson : Good morning, everyone. Could you talk about the cadence of the earnings and earnings growth across the years? It's about 10% across the year. Can you help us figure how that's gonna look Q1 or quarterly or first half, second half? Thanks. David Johnson : Yes, Joel. This is David. I'll take that one. I think we'll look at it more first second half because as you know, given weather and what have you, we could have a pretty significant change between March and April. So when we look at it right now, we would expect to be up slightly in the first half versus the first half of 2024, and a little bit better, I would say, year-over-year comparison than back half of the year. And some of that's driven by exactly what Judd just said regarding the Brazil seed cost position and so on and so forth. So we would expect to see a pretty, I would say, a better improvement there in the fourth quarter for seed. NCP, as you know, we talked about low single-digit pricing. We would say that that would be a little bit low single-digit negative pricing. I should say. That's a little bit more towards the first half of the year. Flattening out in the back half of the year. So you add that altogether, the first half would be up slightly. And then we would see the second half being higher as a percentage of improvement year over year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Thank you, and good morning. Your crop protection EBITDA margins increased 800 basis points year over year, which was quite a bit more than we would have anticipated. So can you maybe rank order some of the key drivers of that? I think you made a comment that you were pleased with technology uptake in Brazil. So just maybe a little more context around what drove margins. And also, I'm curious as to whether there were any positive or negative timing-related considerations in either of your segments. Thank you. Robert King : Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. This is Robert. I'll jump into that one. So Q4 was a really strong quarter for us. And for the overall crop protection business, it was a record quarter as you called out. In Brazil, they had a really good quarter, especially when you compare it to the previous year and a year-over-year comp. And that is part of the part of the large numbers you're seeing, but not to minimize the effort that the teams put in there. The drivers came from the usual suspects that we've talked about, biologicals, new products, in those areas, and some spinosin sales as well. It fell just in line with our key drivers to growth. And that's really what drove a lot of the margin increase on a year-over-year basis as compared to the prior year. The additional I would say is fungicide insecticide experienced some solid growth in Q4. And that's an area that typically has higher margins as compared to herbicides as well. So our mix helped out there also. And then finally, I'll land on cost. Earlier in the call, we mentioned on that, but in Q4, we took $170 million of cost out on a year-over-year basis. So that is moving in the right direction as well. So all of these things came together to deliver a really solid quarter and give us some momentum moving into 2025. Hope that helps. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector from UBS. Please go ahead. Josh Spector : Hi. Good morning. I wanna come back to the question around 2025 guidance. So, you know, when you go through all the puts to take you left out or at least your bridge, FX is really the only major change in there. But you didn't lower the high and low end by $100 million. You lowered the top end by $200 million. You didn't touch the bottom end. So kinda two pieces here is one, why is the top end cut $200 million and not $100 million then at the lower end, are you baking in some of the positives we talked about around corn specifically that helps offset some of that? Thanks. David Johnson : Alright. This is David again. I'll take that question. And typically, one of the reasons you know, we took the $200 off the top is we do narrow our guide because this will be our where our information we gave out last year was more of our initial perspective of the year, which was a wider guide than we typically give. And then at the midpoint then, we did take out $100 million as you mentioned. It is all FX. Actually, FX is $125 million. We made up $25 million there and a little bit of the base change between the $3.76 and the $3.8 billion. In other areas. So slightly improvement in price and slight improvement in volume. So that's where we ended up on the midpoint. On the lower end, we kept the lower end. I mean, I think as we put in our upsides and downsides, really, the downsides would be a further strengthening of the US dollar, difference in planted acres and then you know, our perspective on the CP market as to what that might roll out over time in 2025, particularly around pricing and volume. Chuck Magro : And, Josh, maybe just a couple other thoughts for you. So when we rolled out that wider range, it was a first look. It was a while ago. But you recall, I think we had messaged that we would need to see the CP market return to growth. And what we're calling for right now, you know, three months later, is a flattish CP market. So that was certainly a consideration. If we start to see the market rebound in CP, then we would obviously reflect that going forward. And then the other interesting thing for me when I just look at it, currency is a big number. $275 million. If you add that to the $3.7 the way we guided it. You know, you're into a healthy range there that is not too dissimilar to the number we were providing just a while back. So I think that it's really almost binary where we lowered the midpoint simply because of currency, and we were feeling that. But the top end of that range we would need to see the global crop protection market return to growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Chuck, you look at equity values, there's a widening gap between seed and crop protection assets. Met you're now almost 70% seeds. Would it could it ever make sense for you guys to separate out crop protection from seeds to enhance the equity value? Thank you. Chuck Magro : Yeah. Good morning, David. Look, we look at almost everything under the sun when it comes to do we create long-term value creation. Nothing is off the table. We're constantly looking at our portfolio. We're constantly looking externally at how to use the balance sheet and the cash flow we're generating. And so I wouldn't take anything off the table. However, if you think about how the company is built, right, we're built around a farmer, a global farmer. And they need an integrated set of tools. Especially when you look at how our R&D is completely integrated and working together and then how we go to market around the world. All of those there's significant I'd say, synergies and leverage we get. We're one of the only companies, if you think about how Corteva, Inc. is built, that can bring a full acre solution starting with seed and then a crop protection and biological package now around that. And I think you're starting to see the value of that integrated offering in markets where we're working with farmers directly now. So you know what? As a CEO, I would never take anything off the table. But when I look at the journey that we're on, I have a lot of confidence that the long-term value creation that we've laid through all the way from R&D to how we built our channels to market and the technology we're bringing farmers an integrated offering is gonna be a powerful set of choices, I think, for farmers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Salvador Keanu : Yes. Good morning. This is Salvador Keanu filling in for Steve. I want to go back to the guidance and within the set of assumptions, we don't really see anything about the outlook for dicamba and what upside you could have there from Enlist. And, you know, we are already in February. Fieldwork in the south should start in a month or so. So what is your latest view given there haven't been any registration so far? The supply chain should have stocked at least for their early herbicides. And is this something that is in your guidance or could be something that could be outside? Judd O'Connor: Hi, Steve. Yeah. This is Judd. And relative to dicamba, I think one from a label perspective and, you know, trying to speculate any at all. I think it's too early to call. If you look at where we're at today, we don't have any new information. But our order book for E3 is very, very healthy. We have seen orders come in from the south, which is kind of a long-term dicamba holdout with the soy cotton rotation there. Growers have held on to the technology longer there than they have in, you know, other parts of the market. Our E3 products should perform extremely well. Both from a weed control perspective, our Z series soybeans and the germplasm network sending through licensees as well as through our own brands. Is leading in the market. So that feels good. But we don't have any upside built into the plan for any assumptions around dicamba. We've got, you know, 65%, as Chuck mentioned earlier, market penetration at this point with no upsides for dicamba built into the 2025 plan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham from Citi. Please go ahead. Rachel Leon : Hey, good morning. This is Rachel Leon for Patrick. You've noticed just-in-time purchasing behavior for the past several quarters. So is this the new norm? And do you expect to shift strategy based on this new customer behavior? Robert King : Yes, Robert. Thanks for the question. Yeah. This is really an aspect of what's going on in the global economy with capital markets with high interest rates, holding working capital, etcetera, through the channel and on the farm is something that is just not favorable for folks to do. So as long as interest rates are where they are and product availability is high across the board, we don't anticipate that the just-in-time behavior changes. It's a behavioral shift due to the economy and the way things are, so we're prepared for it as we move forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Edlain Rodriguez : Good morning. Thank you, everyone. So in the fourth quarter, you talked about competitive pressure in seed that you're seeing in Latin America. Do you expect this to continue going forward? And what's really driving that? So why is it so competitive? And you're seeing price decline as a result of that? Judd O'Connor: So, Edlain, thank you for the question. Maybe a couple of things. One, as we went into the fourth quarter and seed, we had a healthy supply position from competitors in the marketplace. We see that settling out. To some degree, particularly with safrinha acres increasing. And then as we go into the second half, which is the most important time of the year for us with our seed business in Latin America. Excuse me. Second part of that question was will it continue? As we go into 2025, as I mentioned earlier, one, good news. Our COGS position gets materially stronger, and we're excited about that. Number two, we have pricing built into our plan. We've taken that pricing forward and feel good about where we are with the opportunity to price in Brazil. In 2025. New products, better technology, bringing more value for growers, and we expect to be able to price for that. Chuck Magro : Yeah. Edlain, maybe just a few other thoughts here. So Brazil's always been competitive. There's no change here. Right? It's a big diverse market as we've already talked about. But Brazilian farmers through many, many years have also showed that they will pay for differentiation in yield. And we have some of the best technology when it comes to seed in Latin America. In many markets, we are the leader and farmers will pay if they're gonna get a few extra bushels per acre or I think the issue that you're seeing reflected in price in our financials was the poor yields and the quality back in 2023. And our deliberate decision to make sure that we clear the decks so that we've got a much healthier business going into the 2025 year. And now you look at is what Judd has referred to is we're expecting a pretty significant increase in safrinha acres. So the market is fundamentally hasn't changed when it comes to seed and how it values seed. And it's growing. And now that we've got a better inventory cost position, I think we like where we're sitting here early in 2025. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Good morning, and thank you. David, a question on working capital. Obviously, a very strong part in 2024. I was curious, on the inventory side, typically, you see a build for Corteva, Inc. Q4 versus Q3. That didn't happen this year. Actually, it went the other way. So did you talk about that? And can you talk about the expectations in 2025? I know that you say that you expect it to normalize. Any sort of metrics around that? Thank you. David Johnson : Yeah. Sure. No problem. When you look at our total free cash flow, this year, the $1.7 billion, and if you look at what I would consider core working capital. So receivables, inventory, and payables. Now that was a tailwind of about $300 million. A lot of that was in inventory, and a lot of that inventory was because of the fact that the year before, we kinda entered the year with more inventory than we wanted to. Primarily in CP. I think the Q4 dynamics would probably be the fact that we had this seed inventory that we wanted to clear the decks like Chuck had mentioned. And the fact that our volumes were up quite a bit in Q4, so there's a little bit of a dynamic there. When you look into 2025, we do expect those kind of core working capital elements to be a slight headwind. I would say somewhere in the $100 million range, but I would say that would be back to more normal levels. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBank. Please go ahead. Ryan Weis : And good morning. This is Ryan on for Aleksey. I mean, I understand you guys didn't bake in anything to the guidance just based on kind of what's been going on with tariffs. But you I wanted to get a better understanding of raw material sourcing and you know, what percentage of raw materials would be at risk kind of to the potential tariffs in Canada and Mexico and then obviously the recent addition China. Thank you. Chuck Magro : Yep. Good morning, Ryan. So this is a complicated question. I'll tell you that right up front. The situation is changing almost daily. And so we have a task team that's working and running models and simulations on what could happen with the different scenarios. Let me start by just saying a couple of things upfront. So our two this is really a CP issue for us. Right? Because it's a global supply chain. Corn is a little different. It's essentially grown and sold in the same region. So this for us is a CP issue. And our two biggest franchise businesses enlist in Spinozan's they are manufactured exclusively in the United States. So that sets up Corteva, Inc. to be basically a net exporter as a company. Now to give you a view on CP, and we'll just use China as an example, it's about 2% of our COGS come from China. And about 80% of that 2%, we have multi-sourced. So the simulation, the models that we've run, and who knows exactly what will eventually happen, but the scenarios that we've run, we think that most of these but you were right to call out we have put none of this in our guide because we just don't have enough confidence on what it may or may not be. So the scenarios that are being discussed right now, we think are completely manageable. And the data point I would draw you to for China is it's about 2% of our COGS and 80% of that is multi-source. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Coty Torena from Wells Fargo. Richard Coty Torena : Alright. Thank you. Chuck, you talked about a very encouraging start to the year for ag fundamentals. Just looking at crop protection in North America, it looks like volumes and price were flat in the fourth quarter. So I was wondering, you just give us some color in terms of how you think North America is shaping up for crop protection? You know, we've heard from some of your peers that there might be some cautious buyer patterns from retailers or growers. So just wondering your thoughts on that. Thank you. Chuck Magro : Yeah. It's probably best that Robert comments on that since he's in the market every day, but the backdrop, I think, right now is you've got as we said, we think there's gonna be a lot of corn acres planted the year of corn. Which helps Corteva, Inc. on many fronts. We do think that farmer margins are improving. Crop prices are up. Inventories are tight. So all this usually drives to sort of an overall positive sentiment. No. It's early, and we have to get through a couple more weeks of winter. We also need a wide-open planting season, hopefully, but so far so good. And then when it comes to specifics in terms of CP inventory, and what the retailers are thinking about for the season, Robert, why don't you comment on that? Robert King : Yeah. I'll just add a little bit of color to it, specifically North America. It's our largest crop protection market, obviously. And things continue to improve there around, you know, the farmers and everything going on commodity prices. So channel inventories are imbalanced. We had a good fourth quarter not unusually high nor low. Products continue to move in preparation for the North America season. And we're continuing to see that as we move into the first quarter here. We're expecting that our products continue to move. In looking at all of our channel partners, etcetera, we set in a really good place on a year-over-year basis. And we, you know, we're expecting that our new products continue to see growth there. Biological is something that is moving into the market in our new partnerships that we've got set up there, we're really excited about. So everything is in the direction of goodness, especially when it comes to inventories in the channel and demand for the technology that we bring to market. Operator : Next question will be from Kristen Owen from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Kristen Owen : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Just given the FX swing factor on the year, can you just remind us hedging practices, how far out you hedge on certain currencies and how that might move through the year. David Johnson : Yes, Kristen. This is David. I'll take that question. Typically, what we do is we hedge our currencies in the year for the year. So we might have a little bit of hedges in place going into the year, but our primary objective is to have some consistency between the quarters within a year. So really, when you look at a year-over-year basis, you know, sometimes that's a benefit, and sometimes it's not. So in this particular case, BRL for us is probably our largest exposure, somewhere around 40% of our total impact in 2025 is BRL. Currently, we have that in at a six or so rate. I will remind everyone that our exposures are more back half loaded into the year, so we'll see where that rate ends up at that point in time. Right now, the rates are a little bit above that rate. We'll see how it goes. But again, I just wanna remind everyone, it is really within the year for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, just clarification on that last point. So the exchange gains and losses line, the EGL line, Legacy kind of DuPont line. But just curious, if that would be kind of similar to what you saw in 2024 or maybe more so in the $300 to $350 million range. And then along those lines, is there I guess, would that impact your cash? I mean, is there any room to maybe increase the buyback or you're just kind of planning for that billion ratably through the year? David Johnson : Okay. Fantastic. There's two questions in there. I would say that on the EGL, I would say it'd be proportionate to probably our EBITDA number if you look at that over time. So you would expect it to be a little bit higher in 2025 versus 2024. Regarding our capital deployment, as we sit today, we do plan on the $1 billion of buybacks somewhat even through the year. Which would be similar to what we did in the prior year. So if you add that along with our dividends, it'll be another year of $1.5 billion back to shareholders. On a roughly $1.6 billion of free cash flow. The difference being, you know, we will plan on continuing to invest in our catalyst program. And then the opportunities in M&A. And then we also ended the year a little bit higher in cash than we typically do at $3.1 billion. So we have a little bit more room there for any kind of tuck-in acquisition. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Ben Theurer from Barclays. Please go ahead. Ben Theurer : Good morning. All questions have been asked. Thank you. Kim Booth : Okay. Great. So that will be that will conclude our call today. We thank you for joining, and for your interest in Corteva, Inc., and we hope you have a safe and wonderful day. Operator : That concludes our conference call. Thank you for joining today. You may now disconnect.",
