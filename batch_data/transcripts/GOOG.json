At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jane Penner, Director of IR. Please go ahead ma'am. Jane Penner : Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Google's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us are Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer. Also as you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So, please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. You can also visit our Google+ Investor Relations' page for latest company news and updates. Please check it out. This call is being westbound cast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today. Now, quickly -- now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward look statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for more detailed descriptions of the risk factors that may affect our results. Please note certain financial measures we use on this call such as operating income and operating margin are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and restructuring. We've also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Patrick. Patrick Pichette : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2014 earnings call. Before we jump into my usual remarks, I'd like to bring two points to everybody's attention. First, a reminder that on April 2nd, we issued our Class C stock dividend with twice as many shares outstanding, our usual per share information will look quite different starting this quarter. Also, second, and also as a reminder, our expected sale of the Motorola business -- mobile business to Lenovo triggered discontinued operations accounting treatment which means Motorola's quarterly results are shown separately from Google net income. You'll see this new presentation in our financials starting this quarter. So with these two caveats noted let's dive into the details of Google's financial performance in Q1. Our gross total consolidated revenue grew a healthy 19% year-over-year to $15.4 billion and it was down 2% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth would in fact have been 21% year-over-year. Google sites revenue was up 21% year-over-year to $10.5 billion and was down 1% quarter-over-quarter driven by the strength in our core search advertising business. Network revenue was up 4% year-over-year at $3.4 billion and was down 4% quarter-over--quarter driven by improved year-over-year growth from our Ad Exchange and AdMob businesses. Finally, Google's other revenue grew 48% year-over-year to $1.6 billion and was down 6% quarter-over-quarter. Digital sales of apps and content in our Play Store drove year-over-year growth. Chromecast sales were also strong. Our global aggregate paid click growth was strong this quarter again up 26% year-over-year and down just 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost per click was down 9% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. Currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on Q1 CPC growth. Our monetization metrics continued to be impacted by a number of factors discussed on previous calls, including geographic mix, device mix, property mix as well as products and policy changes. And to help investors better understand the complex dynamics of these monetization metrics, we'll begin disclosing paid clicks and CPC growth by property in Q2. To be clear this means we'll disclose CPC and paid click growth rates for both our sites and network businesses. We will continue to disclose aggregate growth rates for CPC and paid clicks. Turning to the geographic performance, we saw strong performance in the U.S. and rest of world, solid performance in our U.K. In our earnings slides, which you can find in our Investor Relations' website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K., and rest of world, to show the impact of FX and benefits from our hedging program. So, please refer to those slides for the exact calculation. U.S. revenue was up 14% year-over-year to $6.7 billion, the U.K. was up 14% year-over-year to $1.6 billion and in fixed FX terms, it grew 11% year-over-year. Our non-U.S. revenue excluding the U.K. was up 25% year-over-year to $7.2 billion. This accounted for 47% of our total revenue, which includes a $8 million benefit from our hedging program. And in fixed FX terms, the rest of world grew, in fact, 30% year-over-year. Let me now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.2 billion or 23% of total advertising revenue. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $2.6 billion in Q1, excluding our stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.6 billion, again excluding stock-based compensation and as a result, our non-GAAP operating profit was $5 billion and our non-GAAP operating margins were 32% in Q1. Just a quick word on a few items that may have created noise in our operating expenses this quarter. We had some discrete legal expenses that hit our G&A line as well as one-time M&A related costs that increased our operating expenses, particularly in R&D. So, absent these discrete items, our expenses continue to demonstrate the same disciplined agenda we've always had. Headcount was up, roughly 2,100 people in Q1. In total, we ended the quarter with approximately 50,000 full-time employees and please note that the headcount still includes approximately 3,700 full-time employees from the Motorola business as well as the employees from the acquisition completed in this quarter. Our effective tax rate was 18% in Q1 and our tax rate this quarter was impacted obviously by the federal R&D credits, which expired in 2013. Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expense was $357 million for the quarter and realized gains on investments and interest income, offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging program. For more details on OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website. We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $4.4 billion. CapEx for the quarter was 2.3 billion this quarter; again the majority of CapEx was related to data center construction, production equipment, and real estate purchases. As I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, we continue to invest in the long-term and our infrastructure continues to be a key strategic area of investment for us. Our free cash flow was $2 billion for Q1. And before I close, I want to give a brief update on Motorola. Motorola had a great quarter in Q1 with the Moto G showing strong sales momentum especially in emerging markets. The team continues to be hard at work and we look forward to seeing them join up with Lenovo soon. So, there you have it, strong results and an optimism that provides us the confidence to fund strategic growth opportunities including Android, Chrome, YouTube, enterprise just to name a few. And now I'll cover more details -- I'll let Nikesh, in fact, cover more details of our business performance in the quarter and after his remarks, we'll open up the phone lines for questions. Here you go Nikesh. Nikesh Arora : Thank you, Patrick. You're welcome to cover more details if you'd like. Our business is growing well, with $15.4 billion in gross revenue; we had a particularly good advertising performance in the United States, highlighted by very strong auto sector showing around the Super Bowl. We had strong Play growth in Asia and we had a few isolated tracks. By now you're aware of the four areas driving our business. The first one direct sponsor, or as I like to call it performance marketing; the second one helping clients build their brands; third our ad tech platform for publishers and agencies; and fourth, our emerging businesses like digital content, enterprise, and hardware. Let me give you an you an update on all of those and talk about industry trends that are driving the investments we're making. On performance advertising, people are now always online and they want seamless, easy experience as they move from screen-to-screen. This constant connectivity is driving our investments here as people use search to navigate their world, Google is well-positioned to help people navigate between web, apps and the places around them. They help the marketers measure the entire customer journey and to drive better monetization. Next week, we'll be welcoming hundreds of advertisers to our adverse performance forum where we'll talk more about our work in this area for marketers. But clients are already benefiting from our recent investments like enhanced campaign and estimated total conversion. For instance, Shutterfly recently began measuring cross device conversion networks to understand sales that start in one device and end on another. As a result, they saw 60% increase in mobile conversions for non-brand terms, leaving them to include 100% of their keywords on mobile devices. We're seeing great momentum in product listing adds as well, with a new shop in campaign system. International retailer Farfetch upgraded shopping campaigns and increased their conversion rate by 13% while reducing cost there per acquisition or CPA by 20%. And Domino's Pizza -- who doesn't like pizza, recently made it easy for customers to pay with Google Wallet, instant buy in their in Android app. Moving on to brand building. For years you've all seen the rise of digital video, over-the-top networks, connected screens, streaming devices and high quality digital programming. Already for example, YouTube reaches more than 1 billion people a month through usually popular channels like fashion guru, Bethany Mota; cooking maven, Rosanna Pansino; and cult hit Nerdist. For marketers this is an irresistible trend, and we're now at a significant industry moment. Marketers and agencies that have historically built their brand on TV are reorienting their creative, planning, and investments with digital at the center. This year nearly all Super Bowl advertisers turned to YouTube to extend the life and reaches of their TV spots and Super Bowl related ads on YouTube have been viewed over 300 million times. That's roughly three times the size of the audience that watch the ads on TV. In Australia, we work with Nissan to create made for YouTube video for the launch of their new Patrol SUV. The campaign which is promoted by TrueView ads and YouTube mass set for over 340% increase of daily visits to their websites, and more than 2% of those were interactive for the campaign booked a test drive. In a few weeks in New York at our annual Brandcast Upfront Event we'll focus on our new Google preferred offering. This features exclusive access to the best, most engaging content on YouTube with guaranteed audiences through third-party measurement providers, Neilson and Counselor. We're really excited about this and we're looking forward to the results of that Upfront Brandcast Event. We're also helping brands through our newest display ad formats. We recently teamed with Tory Burch to bring her New York Fashion Week Show to a global audience across our display network. Then also the first ever live stream of fashion show in an ad using a light box ads, and we're able to share the exclusive event with more than 7 million of their biggest fans. Third, moving to our ad technologies and platforms; our programmatic ad technologies are seeing -- are continue to see great momentum with premium publisher partners like The Local Media Consortium. That's comprised more than 800 daily newspapers and 200 local broadcast stations as well as timing. Both of them signed on with us in February to create private exchanges. This maximizes a value of that ad space for handpicked premium environment. One thing we know is that agencies and publishers want to trust the environment in which they're transacting. Our ad network and exchanges are widely regarded across the industry as having the best quality controls and we continue to invest here. In February we acquired wellium fraud fighter Spider.io and thousands of our clients are already using our MRC-accredited Active View technology to buy high-quality viewable ad impressions. Let me switch over to our emerging new businesses, digital content, hardware and enterprise. Google Play continues to be the thriving hub of our digital content business. This quarter we introduced Google Play movies to 39 new countries, so now people in more than 65 countries can enjoy movies through Play. We also teamed up with Sonos to bring high-fidelity play music into the home and we introduce new development tools for Google Play games including game gifting and iOS multiplayer support. Over 75 million new users joined Google Play games in last six months; all of this is helping turn developers around the world into full-fledged businesses. In fact, we paid out more than four times as much money to developers in 2013 compared to 2012. And following the Open Automotive Alliance that we announced with partners in January designed to bring android as a car, in March we've announced Android Wear, a project that extends android to wearables. We're also already working with several consumer electronics manufacturers, chip makers and fashion brands who can't wait to see what developers come up with for your wrist. We also continue to see strong momentum from our suite of hardware products, our $35 Chromecast is a real hit. Last month we brought Chromecast to 11 more countries. We also recently opened up Chromecast developers, and in just a few weeks, more than 3,000 developers worldwide sign up to bring their apps and websites to the platform. Turning over to enterprise. We continue to see strong product adoption around the globe. We launched Chromebox for meetings, which makes it easy for any company to have high-definition video meetings through the power of Google+ Hangouts and Google apps. We're also investing significantly in the Google cloud platform and I've seen a very positive response to our most recent product announcements. We expect to see continued momentum in this area and we believe we can bring significant value to the many companies that opting public cloud because of our experience in building and operating one of the world's largest cloud computing environments for over a decade. We able to pass on the savings that come from lower digital storage cost to our customers through highly competitive pricing. In addition, every day more businesses, governments and schools start using Google apps to work better together including the state of Sao Paulo who moved to Google apps for more than 4 million students and 300,000 teachers and staff. Before I close, I want to call out our marketing team who continues to highlight the magic of Google to beep around the world, into fourth annual Google Science Fair, the doodle for Google in United States, the hugely popular ad campaigns. They also helped to build great retail experience for Chromecast in over 6,000 stores. I'd like to thank all Googlers around the world who help makes a terrific quarter. I'll now hand over back to Patrick. Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Nikesh. So we'll work with Jamie to go straight to the Q&A. Jamie? Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Ben Schachter : Patrick, I was wondering if you could help us quantify some of the expenses you saw, the one-time nature of G&A and anything else there that was really one-time. Just to help us understand what that run rate would look like if that wasn't in there? And then maybe the cash, if you could talk about the theme of sort of advertising attribution and how that's going to help you potentially bring over more brand dollars, and how do you think about bringing over those television dollars. I mean is that something that's going to come sort of a big rushing in 2014, or it's just going to be a slow evolution over many years. Thanks. Patrick Pichette : Great. Thanks Ben. When I start, look on the discrete legal expense that impacted, it really impacted our G&A if -- and then the one-time M&A deal cost impacted all of our operating lines, but most prominently our R&D line, which you'll notice will have jumped a bit. The one-time M&A deal costs are largely stemming from the Nest deal, which was a pretty large transaction for us this quarter, but I think that the best way to describe it is that our expenses in Q1, they are completely in line with our objectives if you'd kind of take apart these two items, so that's how I would describe it. Nikesh? Nikesh Arora : In terms of brand benefit Ben, I think -- thank you Patrick, thank you Ben. The brand question is a very good question. What we've noticed in the past let's just say 1.5 year is that people have slowly started coming to the digital medium to create extensional the existing brand campaigns like I mentioned the Super Bowl ad. People come to YouTube and say I'd like to read certain audiences which are only available on digital medium hence we see those advertising dollars shifting as an enhancing existing television or media campaigns. Now the real fun will began when people start doing campaigns exclusively on digital to go and help them build brands. That requires us to get ahead of the curve and get into the creative process much earlier because usually what we end up doing now is we get up -- we get to the end of the period of process and they just want to extend their brand. So we're working really hard to work with creative ad agencies, the large agency groups as well as our advertisers say how can we get ahead of that creative process, how can we help you conceive of brand campaigns that actually start and end in digital where perhaps you use TV as an extension medium as oppose to the other way around. Now I think this is definitely the Holy Grail. This is going to take us a level of time to get there, but with things like attribution in place with our deals with Nielsen and comScore we're beginning to create the compatibility saying look the same dollar you spend on television equates to so many dollars on digital or vice versa. The fact that we can give them sort of cross media measurement capability, we can give them comfort that their dollars are being well spent, even spent in digital. We will go long way in making sure that we get them to transition from just using traditional media to including digital in their media mix and eventually designing campaigns that start and end up digital. Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Nikesh. Jamie, let's go to our next question. Thank you, Ben for your question. Operator : And we'll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two things I wanted to ask. First, Patrick, just on the U.S. you had commented on the strength here in terms of 14% year-over-year, but it does look like on a sequential basis we saw a little bit more of a DeSale have been in recent 1Qs. Can you just comment if there's any factors there to point out. And then Nikesh, can you just talk about the key drivers of mobile pricing going forward. How you think the gap can close with desktop over the coming quarters and years. Thanks. Patrick Pichette : All right. Thanks for -- Doug, for your questions. So in the case of the U.S. if you think about it you have the Q4 to Q1 issues that are typical. And then, as we've said before, the network business does skew toward the U.S. on a relative basis, so network clearly grew slower than site. So that's what really what you see is that mix of the two, but in aggregate, right, pretty pleased with the U.S. growth overall. So that was a pretty strong quarter. I'm really happy with it. Well, let Nikesh answer the mobile questions. Nikesh Arora : Yeah, Doug, I think thank you again for the question. I've had firm belief and I continue to hold on to it that I believe in the medium to long term. Mobile pricing has to be better than desktop pricing. And I think the reason -- the way to think about it is that in mobile you have location and you have context of individuals which you don't have on the desktop. And the more you known about the user and their context, the more effective advertising you can provide to them. The better the conversion is likely to be for a search or any piece of advertising that you do. There's a whole bunch of building blocks that need to come into play for us like you said to get the gap to close. The good news is a lot of people are spending a lot of time on mobile devices. There's a lot of mobile search queries that we get. People are more and more focused about what they look for in mobile devices. They are closer to intent. They are closer to transaction. You see that there's a lot of friction-less ways of paying and converting transactions into commerce which is happening but things like instant buy etcetera. You're also seeing the lot of advertisers seemed through value of making sure that their present and a great experience on the mobile devices. So part of our challenge has been that if you guys just huge massive advertise in the desktop which over the last decade have become better at advertising, Understanding, optimization, understanding conversion, understanding truncation. That journey is just beginning for advertisers in the mobile site. They're just beginning to understand what it takes for the end user to come transact on their website. So like right now we can leave the horse to the water, we can't make it drink. But with all the advertisers coming on-board and working with us, we are actually begging to show them real transactions and asset beings to gain traction. I think we begin to see that gap continue to converge. Douglas Anmuth : Thanks you. Patrick Pichette : Thanks Doug for your question. Jamie let's go to the next question. Operator : I'm going to go to next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Ross Sandler : Great. Thanks guys. I had a question on the Google Play App Store revenues and Nikesh you just mentioned that you guys paid out 300% more revenue to developers in \u201913 versus \u201912. So, I guess, how much is Play contributing to the overall licensing and other line, and there is clearly some lines or some items in that line that are not growing nearly as fast to get to the current 48% average. So can you talk about maybe what's underperforming in that area? And then last question on this topic is, I think if you go back to the infamous Andy Rubin slides from the Oracle case, the revenue share was around 5% for Google Play App Store revenue share, where is that now and is it changing as the Android ecosystem gets larger? Patrick Pichette : Thanks. So why don\u2019t I take a shot at this. Ross, the \u2013 if you think of our other revenue estimates for this quarter, right \u2013 first of all its \u2013 we\u2019re really delighted by the Play business. So \u2013 and you\u2019ll remember that a year ago we had \u2013 I mean, I'm going to bring back everybody to Q1 of 2013. We had a lot of Nexus 4 hardware sales, because we were in stock out in Q4. And that in combination with the accounting change of our Play app content revenue recognition. Again, remember till Q1 of last year both just simply created a bit of tougher year-over-year comp for this quarter, but overall very pleased with all of the kind of big lines of growth in this space. As for the rev share, I mean, obviously, this accounting change kind of goes to this 30% rather than the what you would have seen before which would have the net and \u2013 but we don\u2019t divulge with the percentages are, that we keep going forward. So that\u2019s basically where we stand on it and that\u2019s why we are pretty pleased with this line for this quarter. Nikesh Arora : And if I can add to Patrick, I think, the important part is, it\u2019s taken us a while to get all the capabilities in place around the world in different markets, making sure we have all the content we need, we have all the app providers we need as well as the we have the payment mechanism. So, we really are excited about the Google Play business going forward. Ross Sandler : Great. Thanks guys. Patrick Pichette : Thanks. Thanks, Ross. Jamie lets go to our next question. Operator : And we will go next to Mark May with Citi. Mark May : Thanks. A question regarding the CPC segmentation for next quarter. Why you may not be in a position to provide these specific data points for Q1. I was hoping that maybe you could give us directionally how CPCs have trended between the owned and network businesses and kind of what are your expectation is going forward? Thanks. Patrick Pichette : So, Mark, you will get the information in Q2. What we really wanted to do with the recognition as we think about giving more transparency to our shareholders, just looking at having exactly as you just mentioned the split between kind of our core sites and then the network itself. I think it will be useful for everybody and then, obviously, we will have the information going forward. So a lot of insights are going to come out of that and we are very pleased to be able to share with you starting next quarter. We've just made this decision over the last little while and shared it with the Audit Committee, the Board, so just stay tuned for next quarter on it. Mark May : There are number of dynamics that play into the blended CPC that you've called out before property, policy, geo and device among others. Once you provide this new layer of transparency, does that really capture the major -- is it really the property and maybe to some degree policy differences that are influencing CPCs between owned and network or will geo and devices continue to play a major role in reported CPC, even once you provide this extra segmentation? Patrick Pichette : Well, they all will and if we do \u2013 we may change just the policies that effect network, you will see them much more in transparent way. So in that sense it\u2019s a very positive kind of news. Whether devices kind of have effects on network versus others, you will \u2013 it will be much more difficult to see. But, clearly, the impacts that are driven specifically for network or for sites you will be able to see on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So I think that\u2019s good news for our investors. All right. Thank you so much for your question, Mark. Jamie, why don\u2019t we go to our next question, please? Operator : And we will go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. Two questions on the U.K. revenue growth at 11% number and on the partner websites at 4%, is there anything you would want to call out that has been unusual drags on those growth rates? I think U.K. is the lowest we've seen and maybe just lot of large numbers and really successful execution of that market. But anything you want to call out for either of those two revenue streams. Thanks. Patrick Pichette : Well, as I said, well let me start with the U.K. The U.K., look, combination of partner mix this quarter, as well as, again, year-over-year matters a lot and we have happen to have a year ago a real revenue favorable weather. I mean, people kind of tend to forget it, but last year we had a very strong Q1 for the U.K. and the combination of these two things just kind of year-over-year made the comparison a little tighter for this quarter. As it relates to websites \u2013 partner websites, I covered that a bit earlier. And we\u2019re \u2013 I mean, again, you back to last year where network, if you think about Ad Exchange, that model change in that model continues to be very, very strong. And we will remember again last year that we started the DLA policy change in Q1 or maybe it was in Q4, but the impact of the DLA actually takes time to flow through. We said that would take multi quarters. So, this has not kind of float over completely. So what you have again there is very strong on the quarters where we want sort of the Ad Exchange and AdMob, but on the flipside of that, right, you still have the tails of the DLA change policy that\u2019s for a year ago. But the effects have not fully flowed through, so even in the coming quarters you should see a bit of an effect there, but, overall, pretty pleased with actually these results, Mark. Mark Mahaney : Thanks Patrick. Patrick Pichette : Thank you. Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question, please. Operator : And we go next to Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Carlos Kirjner : Thank you. I have two questions. First, in the last eight quarters headcount has grown significantly slower than revenue, but this quarter you hired, I think, 2,300 people in the core and headcount grew its revenues. Was this change in hiring rate mostly because of acquisitions and marginally what prevents you from hiring 2,300 people a quarter or even more as the business grows? And secondly, Patrick, in the spirit of giving more transparency to shareholders, can you give us some color on what has driven such a sustained increase in CapEx over the last four quarters? Because, I \u2013 I think clearly it\u2019s not just some lumpy behavior. Are you buying data center sites in advance of demand and if this is the case can we infer that CapEx will revert to historical levels. Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Carlos for both of these questions. So, to the headcount question, I think, you've basically nailed it intuitively, which is, the acquisition of Nest \u2013 the acquisitions this quarter had a quite a bit of people impact on this number. Or kind of if you think of our organic numbers, have actually not changed in any material way. So it just happened, you know, you buy Nest and it comes with a lot of people. We also had, you remember, the acquisition of DeepMind and few others. So for us we had the double hitter of having the opportunity to continue to attract people on an organic basis to our processes and these few acquisitions kind of moved the needle quite a bit for us this quarter. As it relates to CapEx, listen, you are right that we \u2013 and I've mentioned this in the last couple of quarters, where we have \u2013 and just a reminder to everybody, if you think of the CapEx categories, right, data centers first, and data construction then production equipment then all other facilities, it\u2019s kind of like the hierarchy of needs. And in the case of data center construction, we have found that the option value of having more capacity on standby and available to us to grow versus not having it is actually a real strategy issue for the company and in that sense if for whatever reason we continue \u2013 we had a spike in demand that was really pronounced and sustained for a couple of quarters and we did not have the capacity, it would be a real issue strategically for us, relative to the quite low cost of having the infrastructure in place. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re really pushing ahead of the curve and so it\u2019s with this view of long-term. So from that perspective you are also right that that\u2019s the mindset we are applying and we've always said that CapEx was lumpy, so you have a good manifestation of it right now, right here. So thank you for you those two questions, Carlos. Carlos Kirjner : Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Cheers. Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question, please. Operator : And we will go next to Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju : Hey, thanks guys. So, Nikesh, so in order to attract greater brand advertising dollars, it seems like safety and context are also important factors, because you are certainly not falling short on reads. So how close do you think you are to either engineering or coming up with some sort of solution to contextualize all the video content on YouTube, so you can guarantee you advertisers brand safety? Thanks Nikesh Arora : That\u2019s a good question. I think as I alluded to, we are going to do an upfront in a few weeks in New York City called Google Preferred, which is sort of our way of trying to create a premium sort of concentration of content that we can have advertisers advertise against which gives them a higher level of brand safety, a better level of measurement and hopefully plays where they believe that they can actually build the brands and hopefully that will \u2013 that will manifest itself in our ability to have a premium compared to what we can attract to the market without providing those kinds of things. So that\u2019s a very good question. I think that\u2019s what we are hoping to achieve and stay tuned for our detailed announcement of Brandcast. Stephen Ju : Thanks. Patrick Pichette : Thanks Stephen. Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question, please. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : Great. I have three quick things. Did Enhanced Campaigns which you rolled out over the summer, impact Q4 and do you see some more benefits coming this year? Second, on PLAs, we think you had very good success in the U.S. in Q4, did that \u2013 does that, do you still have some benefits to come from that as you roll that out in Europe. How are you looking at the timing there versus how you rolled that out in the U.S.? And finally in the first quarter, maybe you can call out some specific verticals that might have strong or weak for you. Thank you. Nikesh Arora : That\u2019s a good question, Justin. Thank you. Not sure I can give you a lot of detail in terms of precise impacts of any individual products that we have. But, Enhanced Campaigns are working. It\u2019s a necessity that we have to do them both for process reasons as well as the reason that consumers are going from screen to screen as well as advertisers need to advertise across multiple screens. So from that perspective Enhanced Campaigns is working, it\u2019s part of life here. We don\u2019t do anything without Enhanced Campaigns across the board. It\u2019s sort of gone from being Enhanced Campaigns to regular campaigns because we don\u2019t have any unenhanced campaigns anymore. In terms of PLAs, it\u2019s something, as I alluded, is actually working. It\u2019s providing a lot of color in the shopping vertical. It\u2019s providing a lot of hold in shopping campaign effort that we have. PLA is working for us and its sort of working from multiple perspectives. It is providing users the detailed information that they need when they are declaring intent and saying and I would like to search for particular product, please don\u2019t send to me to website. So it is working. We are going to roll that out one, separate time around the world. I cannot comment on the timing exactly. But I think both of those things are having a positive impact in our minds to everything we are doing around here. Patrick Pichette : Just to close on this, just a few verticals here. I mean, again, completely reflecting the economy around us. If you go to \u2013 automobile has been quite strong across the world. Travel, actually quite strong in the U.S., so in the U.K. as well as in the rest of the world, a little bit less in the U.S, but just to give you a sense of. And then real estate, clearly, in the U.S. has been a strong vertical as well as in the U.K, so, again, a good reflection of the economy there, Justin. So, Google Trends, I always encourage people to go and checkout Google Trends as well because they continue to give good insights as to what's going on in the economy which would mirror in terms of verticals. Justin Post : Thanks Patrick. Thanks Nikesh. Patrick Pichette : Thanks Justin. Jamie, let\u2019s go to your next question, please. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question guys. So two ones. One for Nikesh. Nikesh, I would love to get your view on sort of your view of the travel industry. Sort of how are you approaching that industry as a participant from an economy basis in that industry, both the marketing funnel and potentially the booking funnel? Longer term there\u2019s been a lot sort of written lately about the way in which you guys might approach that industry vertical. And then second, Patrick for you. Maybe taking a stab at the one-time expenses from a different approach, when we look at the model, if you take your comments before about sort of smoothing out the expenses we saw in the back part of the year and even year-over-year, it appears that one-time expenses might have been about 50 basis point to 100 basis point impact on each of those two lines which would have sort of brought the blended number back up to sort of somewhere between 75 basis point to 150 basis points on margins. But just want to take a stab at that from a different direction just to quantify it. Thanks guys. Nikesh Arora : Thanks Eric. That\u2019s for the question. I was actually talking about pulling up the article which recently -- were Darren Huston talked about the effectiveness of Google Advertising for price line. I think that\u2019s a public endorsement that all our efforts in the last many years in rather travel industry are actually working. They see tremendous value in our ability to help them bring more travelers to their sites and for them to help convert them into a real transaction. So whatever we are doing is working. I think I am expecting \u2013 suspecting that the comments we are talking about is our continued efforts in providing more and more detailed information when people do searches. And as we've talked in the past before that people\u2019s information needs are getting more precise and we have to keep evolving the results at Google, whether its knowledge cards or Google Now all the things that we do towards giving them more and more precise answers, in which case sometimes we are required to go work with various industries to get the underlying data to surface it when the users are looking as opposed to send them to other sites where they have to go through that search process again. So I think you can expect us to continue do that. But our intent there is to provide a better answer for the users, whether it\u2019s on their desktop or mobile devices. Accordingly, we also working together with the advertisers to provide them various advertising opportunities which allow them to work effectively with the end-user and provide them the answers that they are looking for or perhaps in this case the ticket or the hotel booking that they are looking for. Patrick Pichette : Great. And then on my side, Eric, look, as I said in my earlier comment, our Q1 expenses were completely in line with our objectives and there is always seasonality. As you've noticed, from Q4 to Q1 there is always \u2013 we spend less on marketing and so that\u2019s true for this year as well. And for the other areas, right, we would have been in line with the objectives we've set for ourselves. So these one-time costs were genuinely and that\u2019s where truly one-time. And \u2013 I mean, when you acquire Nest for bit over $3 billion, there is just a lot of stuff that flows through the P&L, lot of accounting, and so that\u2019s really the issue there. So, I would go back to your instinct of at least kind of we should be roughly in line with what our expectations where and they \u2013 that\u2019s why the nature of truly extraordinary items. So thanks for that question. Eric Sheridan : Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question, please. Operator : And we will go next to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Peter Stabler : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Why don\u2019t you revisit attributions for a moment? Given aspects attribution and I think you guys are doing a great job on the cross screen attribution and taking advantage of your ubiquitous login across different platforms and Enhanced Campaigns. Wanted to get a better understanding of how you\u2019re thinking about online versus offline attribution for those types of marketers, particularly brand advertisers, supermarket advertisers, the 30,000 SKUs and those retail channels that don\u2019t have E-Commerce and really don\u2019t have much of the search opportunity. How are you helping them close the gap between their online activity and offline sales? Thanks very much. Nikesh Arora : Thanks Peter. Thanks again for the question. I think as you rightfully pointed out the attribution story on the advertising side is kind of becoming clearer as we partner with Nielsen and comScore, and adopted some of the mechanisms that traditional media has used to create the comparability between traditional and internet media. I think you identity a good challenge which is that how do we bridge the gap between online commerce and offline commerce and relate that to advertising opportunity, i.e. when we sell search, we sell traffic to different people, how do we convince them, how do we make them realize that that traffic that they\u2019ve got normally results in online sales, but also results in offline sales at stores and how do we encourage that activity. So over the last many years around the world we have run specific studies, working with various advertisers which are called online to store studies where we actually try and measure what online activity created by them took to control group's results in more foot traffic in their particular stores and certain reasons about. And we've pretty much had very good results across the board. I can't detail specifics right now because they are all specific to individual advertisers who we work with. But we do understand that opportunity and the problem and we work specifically with third-party research teams to work on figuring out how do we keep showing the online to store efficacy. And there are other products as you can see where we start doing conversion, we start looking at things like Google Shopping which also helps us in those areas. Patrick Pichette : Thanks again, Peter. Peter Stabler : Thanks for the color. Patrick Pichette : Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question, please. Operator : And we will go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to go back to an earlier question there was \u2013 you responded about the building blocks that were needed in order to get mobile pricing, mobile CPCs to convert to desktop. I was just wondering if you could share with us kind of specifically what you think those building blocks are that need to happen over the medium to long-term as you said to see that conversions occur. Thank you. Nikesh Arora : Of course, thanks Heather for the question. I mean, look, there were some very simple things and there are some complicated things. The simple things are, we will make sure that there is payment enablement for users. So i.e. users have a mechanism that allows them to pay with lowest amount of friction, because honestly you and I don\u2019t want to spend our lives trying to enter payment information on a very small screen where you are trying to conduct the transaction. So that enablement is happening across the industry, across multiple payment platforms. There is also the need that when people search for some things they can get quickly down to the information and they don\u2019t have to browse multiple sites, because people are more keen on declaring intent to mobile devices than going and searching multiple websites and trying to figure out what they are trying to do. And that intent could be in the form of restaurant, could be in the form of a taxi, could be in the form of them looking for individual product. And you are beginning to see apps, you are beginning to see solutions on search that allow you to get to that granularity of information. Of course, there is a big building block which is getting all the people out there which shows the advertisers effectively in this case the merchants who actually have to have experience in the mobile site which are simpler to execute on. So try buying something on many companies\u2019 mobile websites and it's more own risk than their desktop sites because they've been spending a decade trying to optimize the desktop site, but they haven\u2019t spent enough time optimizing mobile experience, in some cases not believing that people want to transact with them in a mobile device and some cases they are just slow and they are just slowly diverting resources from desktop to mobile. So, if you take all those things and take the notion that we need to keep sort of working hard towards getting these building blocks in place, I think there's a finite time where these building blocks will come into plays. And as they keep coming into plays, you will see or as we talked about earlier, perhaps the conversion will happen between pricing in mobile desktop. But there's a whole bunch of other issues, I think but those are the big things that we need to think of right there. Heather Bellini : Thanks so much. Patrick Pichette : Thanks for your question Heather. Jamie let's go to our next question please. Operator : And we'll go next to Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird. Colin Sebastian : Great thanks. I wanted to ask you a question on the cloud platform. Since this is obviously a huge revenue opportunity for you and first-off if you could put context around the impact of this business on CapEx and OpEx, particularly on the infrastructure of the service part of the business? And then secondly, if you could talk about how you're planning to differentiate the service, is it really about pricing or is it by tying in the software and platform as a service offering, if you could touch on that? Thanks very much. Patrick Pichette : I can cover the first part and then I'll let Nikesh cover the second. Look we're very comfortable with our cost structure. In light of Google efficiencies, economies of scale, our vertical integration from data center to chip -- to servers, to software. I mean we really have -- we believe we have absolute unique position from a cost structure perspective and therefore, from a margin perspective makes us very, very comfortable. In terms of differentiation, I'll just let Nikesh jump in here. Nikesh Arora : I think Colin -- thank you again for the question. The important part to at least acknowledge in the space of cloud computing is we think that it's very, very, very early days. I mean if you think about the potential scope and scale of what this opportunity is, that's pretty much every business which is going to be around for the long-term has to operate in the cloud. There's no efficiency compared to the efficiency of the cloud, but in compared to owning your own infrastructure running it by yourself. So, this shift is going to happen. It\u2019s a matter of every company going through that shift one at a time. And if you look at the opportunities out there and the options, there's very few options. So, there's a lot of room for all of us to have a great time for many, many, many years before we start worrying about differentiation and why my sort of thing is better than yours. So, right now, the key is to be able to work with the companies out there, the enterprise customers out there to get them to shift on the legacy systems, get on to the cloud and realize that Google has been working in the cloud for more than a decade, because we have been running one of the largest cloud computing platforms in the world in the public space. And we have all of the expertise and skills that are required to be able to serve these enterprises and get them off their current legacy system onto the cloud. So, our effort is really trying to work with each of these third-party partners, trying to get them off the legacy systems onto our cloud. I don't think the challenge right now is the need to differentiate. I think our biggest differentiator is we have the most experience in the space. Colin Sebastian : Great. Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Thanks Colin. Jamie we'll go to our next question please. Operator : And we'll go next to Jordan Monahan with Morgan Stanley. Jordan Monahan : Hi, thank you for taking the question. Actually two if I may. A couple of big picture questions, I think for Nikesh. The first is I think there's an ongoing debate about whether mobile web or mobile app is going to win and what the implications are for various businesses, Google included? And I'm just curious to get your view on whether you think one will win over the other and then whether it matters for Google? And then the second is when you look at Google's share of global advertising, you're coming up on about 10% of total, but when you look at your business in the U.K., you're north of 20% of total. So, when you think about your global businesses as economies start to mature, do you think the U.K. is a fair proxy for thinking about your business globally or are there other factors that you think may prevent you from getting to that type of scale globally. Nikesh Arora : I guess let me answer the second question first Jordan, because I'm standing here Patrick is looking at me asking the same question. I think the way to think about it is that we have 10% by some metric depending on what we believe the total is. As per your metric, we have 10% of the total advertising sort of money. And the U.K. we have 20%. That just tells me there's 90% more opportunity around the world and 80% more opportunity in the U.K. So, we're not going to constrain our thinking in terms of what believe is a stable state. Our aspiration is to be able to serve every advertiser in the long-term and our aspiration is that -- our hope is that every piece of advertising becomes digital advertising. The question is how much of that are we able to provide through our technology platforms, how much are we able to provide through our own sort of properties and how much do we partner with others to provide on their network. So, I guess I'm trying to tell you we don't constrain ourselves and our thinking. I'm not trying to be arrogant, say we want 100%, but we like more than what we have in every market out there. In terms of your question around the mobile web and mobile search, that is a tough question and that is a very involved question and I think the approach -- the best way to think about it is that we're trying to make sure we can make both of them effective for the end-user and make them both work, because we're not about to try and pick winners. Right now, you can see that people spend as much time on mobile devices -- more time mobile devices they are beginning to spend on the desktop and they are spending the time across the mobile web as well as mobile app landscape. We're participating in both those ecosystems, whether it's somewhere placed on the app front, whether it's through our browser-based search properties or through our app-based search properties. So, we're participating across the Board and I think at the end of the day, it's going to boil down to ease-of-use and consumer choice. Jordan Monahan : Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Jordan. Let's go to our next question please Jamie. Operator : And we'll go next to Robert Peck with SunTrust. Robert Peck : Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions if you don't mind. The first is on the revenue side, can you talk a little bit -- can you maybe give us an update about the breakout of YouTube versus DoubleClick revenues, where are those today and where could they be over time? And then on the cost side, Patrick could you just walk us through just how you think about the ROI on capital? We get a lot of questions from investors asking about spending, could you maybe tell us more about the thought process and how the company looks at the ROIC of capital going forward? Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Okay, well Robert, let's start with the last one first and then we'll go back to revenue. ROI clearly we have -- we always look at capital intensity. The fact that we're investing quite a bit in CapEx right now is a real tribute to kind of the potential and the optimism we have about our businesses going forward. Most of our core businesses if you think of YouTube or advertising or search are not that capital-intensive relative to other areas that we have such as for example, Google Fiber, if you think of the access portion right which is much more traditional CapEx. For each of these areas, we actually track and make sure that we have good returns and we have a capital efficient. So even though an area that take the advertising business that we run, even though you could argue that it's phenomenally good on return on capital, the questions that we will ask internally is okay so if the utilization rate is X on our machines on this business, right, why can't it be X plus something? So, even though we have already good return on capital in these areas, we continue to always push the envelope to make sure that our capital efficiency continues to be better and better on a year-to-year basis and then across a portfolio, every area has some capital kind of targets to make sure that we're driving for value. Finally, there's a number of areas if you think of take the newer stuff like Loon, for example. In those cases, you test through the hurdles that we kind of we seed capital to the Loon team as they hid their hurdles and they kind of earned their right to the next cost for funding. And in doing so, right, we continue to always have the business case in mind that says here is why this continues to make sense to fund and invest and with an ROIC or value in mind for the long-term, but in the short-term, it's really kind of delivery of milestones on very specific engineers objectives that actually gives them the next round of funding. So, Robert as you can see, given the portfolio of mature stuff we have and growing areas as well as kind of much more R&D and innovation at the early stages, right, we just need to have a basket of tools to actually manage the concept of ROIC or ROI on each of them. And that's what we do. It's not rocket science; it just requires a lot of discipline on our part. On the revenue side, look, we don't break out DoubleClick or YouTube. I can just tell you as I mentioned a bit earlier; we're really pleased with our network revenue in the kind of AdMob, AdExchange. Many of our areas continue to grow very well and we're very, very pleased by these investments and clearly continue to be very pleased with YouTube as mentioned -- Nikesh mentioned a bit earlier. Robert Peck : Thank you very much. Patrick Pichette : That's the story there. Thank you. Jamie, we'll take one last question. We're running out of time. So, we'll take one last question if you don't mind. Operator : And our final question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffrey. Gene Munster : Hey, good afternoon. Another question regarding trends and mobile CPC. Yesterday you announced an offline conversion tracking plan and program with Datalogic. Is that something potentially the whole online to offline tracking that could have a positive impact on CPCs? And separately any updates on how you think about Fiber longer term? Thanks. Patrick Pichette : Okay, so why don't I take the last portion and then Nikesh may have views on this data conversion plan. On Fiber look, you've heard our announcement earlier this quarter where we're working with 34 cities and looking for working with these municipalities, they've indicated to us they are really excited about, they kind of self-selected to be really excited about getting Fiber and the next generation of access. So, right now, we're basically working directly with them to look if we have the right conditions to actually go to the next stage which would be the build. So, very excited about it. I think that it's a really good sign of things to come in access in general. I think that everybody now in the industry is talking about the gig. It's becoming the standard and we're absolutely thrilled for all of the users out there that can think in one day they will get a gigabit of symmetrical internet at reasonable price. So, stay tuned on the next part of the chapter, but really excited to work with these communities. And Nikesh maybe you want to talk about--? Nikesh Arora : Yeah. Thank you, Gene. I mean as I mentioned earlier and the question earlier from -- I think it was Heather that the online to offline conversions are really important opportunity where it's important for offline merchants to be able to understand what results they get from their online activity. And some of the experiments that we talked about required partnerships of third-party data providers to understand how that happens and I think Datalogic is one of those things, which we're looking out to see how we can help quantify the opportunity and quantify the answer for our offline partners. It's just one of those things that we're doing. Gene Munster : Great. Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Gene. Just in closing before I hand it over to Jamie, just to reiterate the point that Nikesh made a bit earlier to all of our Googlers out there and all of our partners out there, thank you so much for the great work in Q1. What a great start to the year and then we'll see you in Q2. So thanks. Jamie I'll leave it with you to close the call please. Operator : Thank you. Again, that does conclude today's conference. We do thank everyone for your participation. Please have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Google Inc. Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jane Penner, Director of IR. Please go ahead ma'am. Jane Penner : Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Google's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us are Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer. Also as you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations Web site located at investor.google.com. So, please refer to our IR Web site for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. You can also visit our Google+ Investor Relations' page for latest Company news and updates. Please check it out. This call is also being Webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our Web site later today. Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward look statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call such as operating income and operating margin are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and restructuring. We've also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick. Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Jane. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2014 earnings call. So I will dive right into the numbers. Nikesh is going to give you a business update and then we will open-up for Q&A. So let\u2019s dive into the details of our financial performance for Q2. Our gross total consolidated revenue grew a healthy 22% year-over-year to $16 billion and was up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth would in fact have been 21% year-over-year, still very healthy. Our Google site revenue was up 23% year-over-year to $10.9 billion and was up 4% quarter-over-quarter driven by strength in our core search advertising business. Our Network revenue was up 7% year-over-year at $3.4 billion and was up 1% quarter-over-quarter driven by year-over-year growth in our AdMob and Ad Exchange businesses. Finally, Google other revenue grew 53% year-over-year to $1.6 billion and was up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Digital sales of apps and content in our Play Store drove the year-over-year growth. Our global aggregate paid click was strong this quarter, up 25% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate CPC were down 6% year-over-year, but flat quarter-over-quarter. And without currency fluctuation, aggregate cost per click would have been down 7% year-over-year. So currency had a very minimal -- and currency had no impact on quarter-over-quarter CPC growth. As we indicated in our last earnings call, we\u2019re now disclosing paid clicks and cost per click changes by property type in addition to aggregate numbers. So to that end, Google sites paid clicks were up 33% year-over-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google site CPC were down 7% year-over-year and down 2% quarter-over-quarter. On the Network side, network paid clicks were up 9% year-over-year and down 5% quarter-over-quarter. And our network CPCs were down 13% year-over-year and up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a number of factors at an aggregate level, including geographic mix, device mix, property mix, as well as our ongoing product and policy changes. And since we\u2019re now disclosing additional property metrics related to our monetization, it maybe helpful to remind you all of what we include in each property. So let\u2019s start with sites. Sites monetization metrics includes ads that were served on Google owned and operated properties across different geographies and form factors. So these properties include YouTube search obviously -- YouTube engagement ads like TrueView, and then other owned and operated properties such like Maps or Finance and otherwise. Our Network monetization metrics include ads served on non-Google properties participating in our AdSense for Search, AdSense for Content, and AdMob businesses. We also provide corresponding historical data since Q1 of 2013 for reference, which can be found on -- in our earnings slides. Nikesh and I\u2019ll obviously be happy to respond as usual to your question about our Q2 monetization in the Q&A today. But I\u2019m sure that some of you may have detailed questions about monetization trends from prior quarters. And to help you with that, the IR team will be ready to answer your questions after the call. Turning to geographic performance, we saw solid performance in the U.S. and U.K and continued strong performance in rest of the world. In our earnings slides, which you can find in our Investor Relations' website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K., and rest of world, to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please do refer to these slides for the exact calculations. The U.S. revenue was up 12% year-over-year to $6.6 billion. The U.K. was up 22% to $1.6 billion and in fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 15% year-over-year, a clear improvement from last quarter\u2019s performance. As we\u2019ve mentioned in previous quarters, our AdSense for search business skews toward the U.S and the U.K. And our ongoing user focused product and policy changes have continued to have a clear impact on our revenue growth in these two geographies. Our non-U.S. revenue excluding the U.K. was up 31% year-over-year to $7.7 billion, and this accounted for 48% of our total revenue, which includes a $6 million benefit from our hedging program. So in FX term, the rest of the world grew also 31% year-over-year. Let me now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion or 23% of total advertising revenue this quarter. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $2.7 billion in Q2. This is excluding stock-based compensation. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.8 billion, again excluding SBC and as a result, our non-GAAP operating profit was $5.1 billion and our non-GAAP operating margin stood at 32% in Q2. Headcount was up, roughly 2,200 people in Q2 in the last 90 days. And in total, we ended the quarter with approximately 52,000 full-time employees, but please note that the headcount does include approximately 3,500 full-time employees from the Motorola business. Our effective tax rate was 21% in Q2. Our tax rate this quarter was impacted by the continued mix shift of earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries. Let me now turn to cash management. Our OI&E, our other income and expense was $145 million for the quarter. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging program. And for more detail on OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR Web site. We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $5.6 billion. And CapEx for the quarter was $2.6 billion. This quarter, the majority of the CapEx spend was related to data center construction, real estate purchases and finally production equipment in that order. Investor should see our investment in CapEx as a positive signal, since it reflects our sustained optimism about Google\u2019s business. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, we will continue to invest for the long-term and our infrastructure and real estate assets remain a key strategic area of investment for us. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $3 billion. And before I close, I want to give a brief update on Motorola. The team continues to be hard at work and we look forward to seeing them join with the Lenovo team soon. Motorola had a great Q2 with the Moto E and Moto G, both showing strong sales momentum especially in emerging markets. So there you have it, strong results and an optimism that provides us the confidence to continue to fund strategic growth opportunities in many areas including our CapEx area that we talked about earlier. And now I'll let Nikesh cover some more details on our business performance in the quarter and after his remarks, I will take it back to open-up the phone lines for questions. Here you go Nikesh. Nikesh Arora : Thank you, Patrick. You\u2019ve had an amazing last few months at Google and our focus in creating great multi skin experience is paying off. I hope you saw our annual IO Developer Conference a few weeks ago. We were joined by over 6,000 developers in San Francisco along with approximately 1.9 million people globally tuning in online. We unveiled the upcoming Android L release. We also showed how we\u2019re expanding android platform to cars, watches, TVs, as well as making it easy to search Google from anywhere by simply saying okay Google. Making magical products that people love using everyday is what drives our ambition, fuels our business. Last quarter we saw strong growth with $16 billion in gross revenue. We saw particular strength in the travel and retail verticals as well as in several countries like Japan and India. By now you know the four areas driving our business. One, performance or direct response marketing; two helping clients build their brands; third our ad tech platforms for agencies and publishers; and four, our emerging businesses like digital content, enterprise, and hardware. I\u2019ll quickly go through each of them and this quarter I want to highlight the investments we\u2019re making to serve the small businesses. Firstly, in performance advertising, in the long-term we\u2019re battling towards a world where people jump seamlessly across screens of all sizes on all types of surfaces. In today\u2019s world, unlocking the mobile phone opportunity is absolutely key for every marketeer and we\u2019re seeing tremendous amounts of momentum here. We\u2019ve been building popular mobile app formats for years like showcasing a businesses location or click to call, etcetera. The teams are laser focused on making ad campaigns easier across screens and helping businesses measure their effectiveness across devices as well as offline. We already offer great solutions for marketeers wanting to promote app installs, in April at our AdWords performance forum, we supercharged our offerings for app developers across search, display and as well as YouTube. We launched improvements like app deep linking and search to help developers re-engage users, who have already downloaded their app, better targeting options in AdMob to help them recent most likely customers, even a new app install format on YouTube and more powerful measurement tools, so they know exactly how their app is performing at every stage. Mobile hotel booking app Hotel Tonight uses mobile search ads as a the key part of their global marketing efforts because it drives consistently high value users or more likely to purchase quickly in the apps. In fact, international mobile search campaigns drive three times higher conversion rates compared to other direct response channels. We\u2019re also seeing tremendous amounts of momentum in the retailer segments, product listing ads across screen. In fact this past quarter, we sent over three times as much traffic to merchants on smartphones and tablet devices compared to Q2 of last year. Let me go to the second area of brand building. I recently spend some times at Cannes Lions Festival. I know it was working Canne, where Google had a big presence, hosting over 300 meetings with creative agencies and brands. What was actually interesting this year was how much the conversation with brands has changed from years past. Whereas digital used to be just one channel, today\u2019s brand are putting digital at the center of the brand building campaign. We see this from our clients as well and video seems to be the linchpin of the strategy. YouTube continues to be driven by the insanely popular channels from some of our top content creators like breakout hip -- hit Epic Rap Battles of History and new sensation Vice News. We launched our Google Preferred Video offering at BrandCast in April, giving marketeers access to top content at YouTube and we\u2019ve gotten phenomenal amount of support from agencies and brands so far. Digitas was our first agency to sign on and since then Omnicom Media Group has also pledged their support. Brands including General Motors, Coca Cola, and Universal Pictures are also having tremendous amounts of success as Google preferred. Adidas was one of the major brands to leverage our global platform to reach fans during the World Cup. They engaged soccer fans by live streaming events with athletes, promoted them on YouTube through TrueView ads, as well as using beautiful light box ads across our display network. Now a few words about our ad technologies for agencies and publishers. Again, video is at the forefront of our efforts here. Last month we introduced a premium programmatic video marketplace called Google Partner Select to help publishers monetize their video content and to help agencies reach top quality video content across the Web. The feedback that we\u2019ve gotten from agencies and publishers has been great. We continue to see strong growth across premium inventory, particularly with the growth of private exchanges across AdMob and AdSense publishers are increasing their investments in mobile sites and apps and growing their businesses using our platforms. Before I move on to our emerging businesses, I want to talk about an area we continue to invest in, online tools for small businesses. Small businesses are the cornerstone of the world\u2019s economy and a major priority for us at Google. But there is still a huge opportunity as over 50% of SMBs still don\u2019t have a Web site. To help set them up for online success; last month we introduced Google My Business, which helps small businesses manage their online presence across search, maps and Google+. We also have a vibrant ecosystem of partners who have local businesses optimize their AdWords campaigns and we\u2019ve been improving our customer support for small businesses. In fact, over the last few years, we\u2019ve doubled our advertiser customer satisfaction scores which bodes really well. Now, let me talk about emerging new businesses, digital content, enterprise and hardware. Google Play continues to grow at breakneck speed across all types of digital content, helping developers and content partners reach users around the world. For instance, Play Movies is now available in over 90 countries, with its recent additions in Argentina, Poland and the Czech Republic. We also recently signed deals with CBS TV and Viacom to bring their TV content to Google Play. With over a 1 billion active android users to going success of Google Play, means that more developers are building successful global businesses in our platform. As we mentioned at IO, since last June, we paid out more than $5 billion to developers through Play which clearly means it\u2019s a growing business for us as well. Shifting gears to our enterprise business, I can report that over 60% of the Fortune 500 use our paid products. This quarter we added even more like Rockwell Collins. They signed up 20, 00 employees to use Google apps. We also launched Google Drive for work, a premium service of businesses that includes unlimited storage. The reception so far has been great and we even closed our first sale within minutes of the announcement. Our cloud platform business also has momentum with new features announced at IO. On the hardware side, over 1 million Chromebooks were sold into schools. Clearly a record quarter and the popularity of Chromecast continues to grow. Now available in Australia, Korea, Portugal and many more. I got to watch some World Cup games from the ESPN app using my Chromecast. Before I close, I want to mention our marketing team, in addition to a great IO this year, we also launched the Made with Code initiatives with partners like Girl Scouts with the USA and Girls to Code, to inspire the next generation of women coders. We are really excited about the enthusiasm around this initiative and who knows hopefully some of this chorus will join us at Google. With that, I\u2019d like to thank today all the Googlers around the world who helped make this a fantastic quarter. On a personal note, as you might have seen, I\u2019m moving on to a new adventure. I\u2019d like to thank Larry and Sergey and the founders of Google, my colleagues and Larry\u2019s staff as well as everyone at Google for the amazing experiences and the phenomenal 10 years I\u2019ve had. I look forward to working with them in the future and cheering them from the sidelines. I\u2019ll hand back to Patrick. Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Nikesh. And as you\u2019ve just heard, this will be Nikesh\u2019s last call. So I want to take a minute on behalf of Nikesh, your friends here at Google, your colleagues and also all of Google -- all of our Googlers, to thank you for all of your contributions to Google over like what has been really a decade of work. So thank -- huge thanks. Well many of you on the call may have questions about transition, if you don\u2019t mind, we\u2019d like to the keep the discussion focused on our performance in the last quarter, if you don\u2019t mind. So that\u2019s really where we will focus our questions. And with that, why don\u2019t I turn it over to Jamie who will line us up for our Q&A. Jamie? Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Mark Mahaney : Thank you. Two quick questions. The recovery in the growth rate in the U.K., could you provide more color around that or was it just you had hard comps last quarter, but the growth rate really consistent with what you had seen before. And then there was been some recent reporting about YouTube revenues. Could you just clarify even if its just historical data, the size of that asset? And any more color around the growth there, new monetization initiatives etcetera. Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Yes, so it\u2019s Patrick. And as we -- Mark as we\u2019ve discussed in the last quarter, we had talked about the U.K. having had a tough comp the year before. So you can see basically the recovery of that in the numbers and we\u2019re pretty pleased with the momentum there. In terms of YouTube, I mean we -- I know there has been lot of speculation out there, but in essence, where we\u2019ve is a great opportunities in front of us and we don\u2019t comment on outside estimates. YouTube, you know it serves as a powerful starting point for advertisers, for looking to anchor their brand campaigns online and coupled with the online measurement of the digital audience is being Neilsen, ComScore, everything that we just announced over the last couple quarter, right. Clearly a great runway ahead of it. So that\u2019s basically the story on YouTube. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Patrick. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. Jamie, what\u2019s our next question please? Operator : We will go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. I guess, on the cash may be you can give update on your e-commerce initiatives. You called out retail as one of the strongest verticals in the quarter. Why didn\u2019t you get a little more detail on what (indiscernible) in San Francisco? Thanks. Patrick Pichette : Yes, thanks Eric for your question. I think two quick answers that, as we\u2019ve talked in the past PLAs is actually a fundamental sort of existential need of our product. So research business, because as people go to tablets, as people go to mobile devices, they\u2019re looking for more and more precise answers when they search and the ability for them to go directly to the entity they\u2019re searching for is phenomenally powerful when you\u2019re searching lots for these things and Sridhar and his team have done a great job working with every retail out there, try and get as many products listed. And our product listing service, so when you actually search you get a plethora of option in terms of where you can buy the product, what it\u2019s priced at and how many products are available in their category. So it\u2019s actually very, very good evolution from a search perspective, which clearly translates into people clicking on those and thereafter hopefully driving more commerce towards our partners and retail segment. As I said, we drove three times as much traffic this quarter\u2019s and we did same time last year. So its clearly good. In terms of Google shopping express, its start of as an experiment, clearly I use that delighted with the service. I mean, I cant seem to find people who are not happy with Google shopping express. And we\u2019re seeing tremendous results. We\u2019re learning a lot. We are getting a logistics right. We\u2019re getting our processes right and you believe its clearly an opportunity for us and our teams are really, really excited about continuing to invest in that area and you keep experiment with different formats and different solutions to make sure that we can provide the most optimized experience to our users. Yes, just a point of clarification, you talked about an overnight service in San Francisco. In fact, we\u2019ve launched overnight deliver in all of northern California. But that continues to be an amazing demand for the product? Patrick Pichette : Thanks and good luck going forward Nikesh. Nikesh Arora : Thanks, Erik. Patrick Pichette : Thank you very much. Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question please. Operator : And we will go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Ben Schachter : Nikesh, good luck in your new role from me as well. Patrick when you\u2019re budgeting for some of the longer term projects and you\u2019re trying to think about sort of a timeframe to get to profitability. For instance, the team at Google X or Google fiber or something on self driving cars. How do you think about the timeframe for getting to profitability? Is there any general rule on how far away it needs to be? And related to that, in terms of the potential financial contribution within the next say three to five years. What are the new initiatives that you expect to have the most impact? Thanks. Patrick Pichette : Thanks for your question, Ben. And what you really have is, as I\u2019ve explained many times before, we set up our kind of governance around a bit of like a BC model where we actually have gating and funding. And projects that have -- there are more software based. We will have much shorter life times before we expect a bunch of returns. Projects that are much more kind of fundamental physics R&D, will have much longer life, like kind of timelines for actually funding and expected milestones. But in both cases they\u2019re all set around the boundaries of -- you have a business case, you have a thesis and that thesis is basically tested on a regular basis through the gating of the funding that they get. And in some cases like self driving cars, obviously multiyear and we\u2019ve a couple of other projects and (indiscernible) of that nature were it will take -- we think of kind of half decade, sometimes even a bit longer before we know that -- you can get kind of real momentum on revenue and profitability. Others are much shorter. So that\u2019s how we kind of think about it. What matters most is really that we actually set up that gating and that we have these refinements to the business models and you know Google Shopping Express another great example of that where you just kind of have the gating and then they come back for funding every so many months to kind of look at where its going. So that\u2019s what we have in terms of the next three to five years, I wouldn\u2019t be able to comment on the specifics of anyone of those, but you can basically through the guidance I\u2019ve just given you. You can come through what is really an asset in terms of versus a software kind of intensive kind of play and then it gives you a guidance of how fast and how slow we should expect our returns to be. Ben Schachter : Great. Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Thanks, Ben. Great question. Jamie let\u2019s go to our next question please. Operator : And we will go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : Okay, thank you. Couple ones. You mentioned on the prepared remarks that the U.S growth has been impacted by some of the network changes. I don\u2019t suppose you could quantify it, but please do if you can. When do you think you kind of work through all those changes and we can start seeing a normalized growth rate or maybe you can answer by how far you\u2019re along that process? And then the second question, pretty excited about Google Play opportunity. Can you just tell us what -- what\u2019s the margin opportunity related to Google Play or the profit opportunity? Thank you. Patrick Pichette : I will take the first and then I will let Nikesh talk about the second. On the first one, we have -- we\u2019ve talked about this again as you said so rightly Justin, we have talked about a couple of things going on right as early as -- early kind of Q1 of 2013 we announced these DLA policy changes and you all remember that and we also reminded you at the time that by announcing these changes, it will take time to actually flow through to a bunch of partners across 2013. So clearly there is an effect there on a year-over-year basis, as it all -- it didn\u2019t all happen in Q1 of \u201913. In addition to that, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we continue to have ongoing user focused product changes and they continue to impact our AFS business is an example. So AFS, right and then what you end up with is you all remember that AFS or AdWords for search -- essence for search, it really skews to the U.S and the U.K. And because of that, that\u2019s why you see the disproportion into those results. So on the DLA obviously, they will lapse over the course of this year and -- but the additional kind of continued product changes and user focused product changes and policy changes will continue to kind of hammer them to make sure that we get the perfect balance between what is right for the user and what\u2019s right for the advertiser. And so that\u2019s why all in all, I feel pretty confident in what I said, when I said that we\u2019re pretty pleased with our growth rate in the U.S. As for the Play, why don\u2019t I actually let Nikesh give you a bit of comment on that? Nikesh Arora : I think its important to step back and look at what the Google Play team has achieved. I mean its -- it come from nowhere. It\u2019s a phenomenal platform which provides services, apps, content around the world as we mentioned over 90 countries of Google Play movies. And as Patrick would say, $5 billion developer which is 5,000 million, so lot of money. And its actually really great for innovation. Its phenomenal for the app developer ecosystem and it\u2019s a really good binding glue for the android ecosystem, because people find tremendous (indiscernible) and all the apps and all the services they get at Google Play. For us we\u2019re really, really very excited about the Google Play opportunity. I think in terms of margin, you should be able to look at the market and understand how typically these relationships work and should we know different than what the current market is around the margin opportunity for services in the long-term. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Justin. Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question please. Operator : We will go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Ross Sandler : Thanks guys. I have two questions, product related. So at IO you announced some new innovation in search and discovery for apps, including opening up app indexing globally. So what kind of timeline do you think Google is on before we start to see a lot of app content appearing in core search results more regularly and what kind of revenue opportunity do you see around that? And then the second question somewhat related is you also announced a bunch of new screen for android, watches, TVs etcetera. I know its still very early days, but do you envision the long-term business model for these being similar to the existing model with ads in Google Play or do you see potentially feeling close loop transactions as an example? Thanks. Patrick Pichette : Ross, thank you for your question. Let\u2019s talk about the app indexing first and then about the screen stuff. I mean, if you think about it, Google has been in the business of making sure that we drive traffic on behalf of people and advertise and help people find things. And as you look at mobile phone behavior, people spend a lot of time on apps as well as in the browser searching for things. So I think it\u2019s important for us to make sure that we provide the content that users are looking for. So, you should expect us to most aggressively try and make sure that App Indexing all happens and its available and easily accessible across devices and people are looking for things we\u2019ve provided them the most relevant answer in which in certain cases that happens to be the app. So allowing for people to discover apps as well as creating more engagement for apps that people may not have been engaging with for a while. So, I think clearly an area of focus and clearly you should see -- expect us to see activity in that space. And in terms of revenue its not unlike any revenue we cerate in the search where we help people find things and that allows us to create an advertising opportunity where people are -- we\u2019re able to monetize that on behalf of sort of our properties. In terms of your second question, I think you have to take a longer term point of view towards the screen question. As you can see all the screens are sort of almost designed as island where every screen has its own operating system, has its own ability to work. But we\u2019re noticing more and more people want to switch from screens and retain the service experience. And towards that end, the android team is doing a phenomenal job making sure that we provide that seamlessness across screens and the fungibility of services across those screens. So, I think long-term we have to think about this as a user centric model. We\u2019re helping users take their services fungibily from one screen to the other and making that happen seamlessly. And if that works out I think there is will phenomenal business opportunities for us in the future. But at Google we always worry about the user first and we\u2019ll figure out the monetization when we have a lot of users excited about it. Patrick Pichette : Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Jamie, why don\u2019t we go to our next question? Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Carlos Kirjner : Thank you. Two questions if I may. One on revenue, is there a significant positive net impact of growing penetration in usage of smartphones on search place and revenue? And what happens to search revenue growth if there is no more benefit in developed markets as smartphone penetration approaches a 100%? Second, you added more than 2,400 employees to Google in the quarter versus 1,400 in the second quarter last year; I think that\u2019s the highest quarter of the headcount addition in more than two years. Patrick, it is the new normal in terms of the rate in which you grow headcounts for the core. How do you think about the rate of headcount growth versus gross profit or you don\u2019t think about it at all? Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Let me tackle that second one and then I\u2019ll let Nikesh, talk about the first one. On the issue of headcount, look we have this amazing opportunity and machine to actually look around the world to look for the best engineers. And we promised ourselves that, given the bar it\u2019s very, very high. When we do find people that fit the culture and that we think will actually do a great contribution and be great Googlers, we actually don\u2019t hesitate and we hire them. Because if we hire them a bit too early or a bit too late it might unbalance, we\u2019re very happy to have them early on. You\u2019re right that, if you look at the last couple of quarters I mean the trend has been pretty kind of solid. And in addition to that you have to look at the impact also of our acquisitions when we make acquisitions that kind of compound\u2019s a bit the numbers. But from that perspective Carlos, we don\u2019t set up a specific target we say we\u2019re going to end up with X amount for this quarter and then that once we hit our quarter we see everybody else next quarter. So from that perspective we\u2019re a bit more organic about it. And we are -- the vast majority of our hiring to kind of give comfort to our investors is, it is really still in the engineering field and the product management field which is really where we want to focus our attention, and we continue to focus there. So, that\u2019s basically the puzzle with which we work. On the question, maybe Nikesh can talk about revenue and smartphone penetration. Nikesh Arora : Yes, of course (indiscernible) the answer is, yes. As we see more and more users with penetration of smartphones, people spend more time looking for things in their smartphones. And I think there\u2019s a very, very long sort of runway that this opportunity has, because we\u2019re just seeing people getting on to smartphones. Now you\u2019re beginning to see businesses and other websites take mobile very, very seriously. They want to be present on mobile. I think the revenue opportunity is phenomenally high, because right now mobile does not monetize as well as certain other forms. But given the huge influx of queries we\u2019re seeing, we expect as people make it more and more relevant to be able to find information in the long-term, mobile should be monetizing even better than desktops. So, I think as a tremendous runway going forward, I don\u2019t think we have to fear the sort of saturation of smartphone penetration in developed markets for a while. Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Carlos. We\u2019ll take our next question, Jamie. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Anthony DiClemente : Thanks very much. Patrick, can you give us an update on your internet access initiatives particularly Google Fiber. Maybe update us on the evolution of the economics of that business and then perhaps even the timing of the Google Fiber rollout for more recently announced cities? And then a separate question on the Google Compute Engine business. How big of a growth driver can GCE be? And what do you guys see as the competitive advantage that Google has and what seems to be an increasingly competitive space in terms of the Cloud? Thanks. Patrick Pichette : So why don\u2019t I jump on the first one, and Nikesh if you don\u2019t mind talking about GCE afterwards. Look, here\u2019s what's going on with Google Fiber. It\u2019s important to bear in mind the following. First is, the economics of a fiber network today are clearly much cheaper than they were say a decade ago. There have been a lot of improvements in cost reductions and technology components all through the fiber network, but also in the way we build it. The second one is, I just want to remind everyone that, an important part of our strategy is actually to build the demand. So, unlike the typical over builder, actually we have a very different kind of business model and thesis for that. And we do work closely with each city to streamline the process that keeps again the cost of construction way down. So, as an update to you right now, Anthony we have as you know we are working with 34 cities, separate cities with a kind of completed checklist of items to help us prepare for the next kind of wave of our construction project. And we\u2019re going to be basically, they are in the last rows of finishing these checklists and its coming back with us. Over the coming months we\u2019ll actually be going through all of the details with them, whether it would be write away or permitting or otherwise, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to use to make decisions as to how broad a program will have. We expect that to kind of give an update between now and the end of the year as the information comes along. So, we\u2019re really thrilled about the opportunity. It continues to be kind of a great piece of focus for us. And just stay tuned for more, the next update on it. As per the GCE, do you want to take it Nikesh or? Nikesh Arora : Yes. So I think, what's very important on sense, we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, that we believe there is a lot of businesses out there have still to shift to the Cloud. We think in the long-term every business will be most efficient when they shift to the Cloud. So we\u2019re not really concerned about trying to compete with other Cloud providers. What we\u2019re really concerned about is making sure we have an amazing offering for businesses so they find value in working with us and making sure that we can support them in their transition to the Cloud. We think we have a great set of products. Our team is really excited, we\u2019re beginning to ramp up. So, I think there is tremendous opportunity going forward. I think it won\u2019t be time to slice the pie for a long time because a lot of businesses are clambering to move their business to the Cloud, because that\u2019s where the users already are, because we\u2019re used to the Cloud and are personalized and its about time that our businesses that we work in actually got to the bleeding edge of technology as much as the consumer services are. Anthony DiClemente : Thank you very much. Patrick Pichette : Thanks, Anthony. Jamie, lets go to our next caller please. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Mark May with Citigroup. Mark May : Thanks for taking my questions. A follow-up on the network business. I think some of the quality initiatives that you\u2019ve been undergoing and continued too for a while, part of the intended consequence result I would imagine would be to recognize higher overall CPCs or pricing every time, but that doesn\u2019t seem to have been the case so far. So, I wonder if you could shed a whole light as to why we\u2019re not seeing that show up in some of the metrics of kind of what your expectations are going forward, is that in fact one of the intended consequences that we should be expecting going forward? And then secondly, you\u2019ve highlighted not just this quarter, but previously that one of the main headwinds to the company\u2019s overall CPCs has been the mix shift around geography. I wonder if you could shed some light on if you\u2019ve been seeing or making any progress in closing the gap there maybe in markets like APAC and what exactly are you doing to try to improve pricing outside the domestic and more stylish markets? Patrick Pichette : Yes, so Mark, it\u2019s Patrick. I think that you really pointed a fact that we are spending, there\u2019s so many factor\u2019s. The issue we have with the CPC -- one of the key things about CPC is clearly it gives you a trend, but the trend is really shaped by the combination of CPC and clicks. So, you can\u2019t just look at one in isolation of the other, it\u2019s really that mix of the two. And in the case of network for example, I mean we just discussed at the beginning of the call that, we\u2019ve put a lot of time and a lot of energy in the last 18 months to actually work on quality issues. And that clearly has an impact when you push on quality to -- when you look at the mix to actually drive for the kind of revenues and growth rates that you see in our results on the network. Having said that, it\u2019s also compensated by all of the other positive factors that we see whether it be as you said geography or product mix or otherwise. So, all in all I think that the team is doing a good job, both on network and on sites, and you can see that as well on our detailed information about, of sites where we continue to see the kind of -- or certainly over the last few quarters kind of creeping back up of CPCs which actually continue to push for this quality issue. In terms of geography, I think that yes, geography makes a big difference and that CPCs are much in some cases lower in international markets or emerging market. But the team continues with a number of localization initiatives to, like so we don\u2019t take CPCs as just one general. We will focus on each country, look for initiatives on localizations for each country to get the maximum CPCs on a geographic basis country-by-country basis, and that\u2019s why you\u2019ll see a lot of localization initiatives. They\u2019re just one again, one contributor. And it\u2019s really early days. There\u2019s so much potential in many of these areas and that\u2019s why Sridhar\u2019s team and our Search teams continue to work side-bye-side to continue to push on these areas. So, we see a lot of runway in this one, and geography is just one of these areas. And you mentioned like APAC, but APAC was a combination of more mature markets like Australia and Japan, and then we had the real emerging markets in there as well like Indonesia or India. So, even APAC itself is again localization matters immensely because very different answers for different countries. But all in all a pretty good story, and we\u2019re really proud to continue to focus with this balance between user first and then make sure that we have the right monetization. So, thanks for your question, Mark. Jamie, lets go to our next question please. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask two things. First thing to the added disclosure just on volume and CPCs. If we look at the sites data on pricing, it looks like we\u2019ve seen an inflection here over the last two quarters, and then now more flattish here sequentially in 2Q. Can we interpret from that, that we\u2019ve seen the worst in terms of the negative pricing impact from mobile? And can you give us some color on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of like-for-like mobile pricing as this point? And then secondly just on CapEx, Patrick, can you just help us understand how your philosophy may be has changed around CapEx spending over the last few years and if you\u2019re in this period of building out potentially a lot of excess capacity, is it reasonable to think you\u2019re at some point over the next few quarters we can also see things slow down as the business grows into that spending more? Thanks. Patrick Pichette : So, Douglas let me start with the last question first and then I\u2019ll jump to the first. On CapEx, listen, if you listen to the script I gave a couple of minutes ago, interestingly this quarter that in priority order was construction of datacenters. Second was actually real-estate which typically would have been historically, you would have heard me talk about kind of equipment, and then equipment was third. So, CapEx continues -- we think continues to be a strategic asset of ours. And you\u2019re correct, and we\u2019ve signaled that, that we\u2019re actually building -- we have a big building program right now because these are long lead time items for our datacenters, and we\u2019ve just talked about a minute ago about GCE and other Cloud services that continue to grow. So, to strategically have the capacity versus not having the capacity is such a strategic asset to us that will continue to look at way. In terms of real-estate we found the same time. We found that we have, when we have opportunities to actually acquire real-estate that it\u2019s a make versus so buy versus lease option. And if you think of our growth and the growth in the strategic areas where we want to be, when we find great opportunities I think that we have a no-regret move in actually taking that action. So, you\u2019re seeing more activities on that front which answers a bit, a lot of questions have been around, is the core business kind of capital intensity growing? Well you can see from these kind of data points that it\u2019s not really that, it\u2019s really a strategic focus that we have right now in making sure that we have the long-term assets necessary to win. So, that\u2019s basically the mindset in which we\u2019re kind of investing in CapEx. In the volume of CPCs, you\u2019re talking about more flattish sequential in Q2, this is for sites I assume. Was that for sites? Douglas Anmuth : For sites, and the lower or smaller decline over the last two quarters? Patrick Pichette : Yes, again I would refer you back to the IR team to get a lot of more detailed questions. But I think on a quarterly basis there can be so many fluctuations. I think year-over-year gives you a much more kind of realistic trend about what is fundamentally going on in the business, because one or two changes can really kind of swing, even seasonality can swing quite a bit both in terms of growth rates or CPCs -- clicks and CPCs. So, be aware always of -- and if you can see that in the network numbers, clearly on the quarter-over-quarter as well there is a lot of noise in the data. So you have to be careful in the quarter-over-quarter. But year-over-year actually gives you a pretty good story of the efforts we\u2019re putting into this. That\u2019s how I would do it. Thank you very much for your questions. Jamie, lets go to our next question please. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Peter Stabler : Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to revisit the topic of small business for a second. Could you help us understand a little bit on some of the qualities of the small business growth profile? Is this about bringing businesses that have no online identity online or is it about taking more mature small businesses and getting a greater share of the spending? Just wondering if you could step back and maybe give yourself a report card on the small business progress you\u2019ve made and where the best opportunities are? Thanks very much. Nikesh Arora : Thanks Peter for the question. I think again, if you think about the phenomenal scale at which the Google team operates vis-\u00e0-vis small businesses it\u2019s staggering. And we have millions of advertisers, millions of publishers we deal with. And we\u2019re trying to make sure that millions of publishers get monetization through advertising at the same time we\u2019re trying to work, make sure that millions of small businesses achieve their goals in trying to drive traffic both online and offline into whatever services they\u2019re offering to their end users. Now, as we\u2019ve gone through this transition to mobile and it\u2019s very important that these small businesses make their transition effectively, because all the user traffic is slowly and steadily shifting towards mobile. And part of our effort is to make sure that we work closely with all of our small business advertisers existing to help them go mobile, at the same time trying to bring on more small businesses both onto the mobile and the desktop platform. So, it\u2019s really a concerted effort to try and support small businesses around the world through very targeted program\u2019s to show them ROI, to show them the value of living online because we believe in the long-term that\u2019s where most businesses are going to get conducted. So, it\u2019s really a long-term strategic effort to bring them all onboard, and I think the teams are doing a phenomenal job executing that ground. Peter Stabler : Thanks for the color, Nikesh. Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Peter. Jamie lets go to our next question please. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had two, I guess, given the success of Chromebooks over the past few years, how you think about the direction of Android and Chrome from a development standpoint as you look out, and also when you think about the multi-screen comments that you made before, that the value being able to transfer peoples experiences across screens? Patrick Pichette : Did you say, you had two questions Heather? Heather Bellini : Yes, and then I had a second one which just I was going to start with that one since it was long winded. And then the second one was just, Google Shopping Express seems to be a great way to impact the small business environment. I\u2019m just wondering now that we\u2019re seeing that expand into different areas. Is that kind of the, should we start to see an inflection in small business advertising adoption? Patrick Pichette : Okay, we\u2019ve got the two questions. I think Google Shopping Express is really about local and local is really about both small businesses as well as large businesses. So, it really -- so absolutely small businesses will be as part of the focus area. And we\u2019re engaging with many of them which is actually pretty terrific, but it\u2019s really about local. So it\u2019s not only with the focus of small businesses, and that\u2019s really the focus of Shopping Express. In the case of Chromebook\u2019s and Android, I mean we\u2019ve discussed this many times in the past where basically you have a great convergence because there is humongous strength in both of these platforms, and they\u2019re basically converging in many ways. Today you can get -- for example, on an Android phone right Chrome kind of powers the search and vice versa. So we have a lot of these cross-pollinization between the two teams. They\u2019re under one leadership which is Sundar, and he basically actually makes sure that these two teams continue to work into an integrated fashion. Everybody knows that Chrome has a huge focus on security, and that is in fact a great focus to kind of migrate over into the Android ecosystem to make sure that we have kind of the equivalent of enterprise grade security for all of our users whether they be Chrome or Android. So, I think that, when you think of multi-screen there are both of these OSS are actually very complementary to each other, and that\u2019s why we continue to kind of work in parallel. I think that across these multi-screens you should expect, Android continues to be very much the thing of choice for mass and Chrome continues to be very much the enterprise infrastructure, and you should continue to see kind of that evolve with that collaboration. So that\u2019s how we think about it, Heather. There\u2019s no kind of, its one or the other. I think that they are perfect compliments. So, thank you for your question. Jamie, we\u2019ll go through our next question please. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Youssef Squali with Cantor Fitzgerald. Youssef Squali : Thank you very much. Two quick questions please. Going back to Doug\u2019s question about CapEx; can you -- Patrick, can you give us any example of a non-search initiative where you\u2019ve invested heavily over the last maybe three, four, five years where the ROI today exceeds your threshold, I\u2019m assuming maybe on the display side. And then on the YouTube content strategy, how high in the professionally created content funnel do you want to get over time we\u2019ve seen more and more professionally created content. So, if you can help us with that that will be great. Thank you. Patrick Pichette : I mean we have a whole host of products where they are, just think of display, think of YouTube, think of maps, think of -- I mean there\u2019s been so many of these products that, Gmail, Chrome, Android I mean all of those, whether they are directly tied to advertising because they are an advertising product or they are a platform that actually gives you distribution that gives you a great infrastructure on which kind of that fuels the searches and the advertising. I think that we have so many areas that we get absolutely terrific return. So, it\u2019s not only about search, it\u2019s really about the entire experience and the delivery around them. Then your second question is, could you just repeat the second question for me please? Youssef Squali : Sure. Just trying to understand the content strategy within YouTube, so just how high do you want to go up the professionally created content funnel, and how do you plan monetization if it\u2019s all advertising or is there another model? Nikesh Arora : Thank you, Youssef for the question. I think it\u2019s fair to say that YouTube has all forms of professional content available today. It has all the way from user content to very popular user content with people like Michelle Phan etcetera, and it has a lot of clips from professionally created content from various media partners we talked about CBS and Viacom in the earnings call. So, we have lots and lots of content from different players out there. And our monetization model in YouTube is working. It\u2019s a phenomenal model. It is now the linchpin of each of our brand strategies if our partners and advertisers want to come work with us to create brand campaigns because YouTube allows you to actually target a fragmented set of interest in a most efficient fashion as opposed to try and do burst advertising that you would do in television and broadcast more. So, clearly the monetization model is working. In terms of other models as you\u2019ve seen in the past we have experimented with various models on YouTube and we continue to experiment to see if advertising is the only model or there are ways that we can monetize using subscription of paid for content. I think that we will continue to do and see which ones in those sticks with the users. Youssef Squali : All right, thanks and all the best Nikesh. Nikesh Arora : Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Patrick Pichette : Why don\u2019t we go to our next question please, Jamie? Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Richard Kramer : Thanks very much. Nikesh, could you just expand on that last comment, putting together Google Fiber and a year on from YouTube channels. How important is it for Google over time to establish a subscription based type revenue stream especially if content moves to bundles. And for Patrick two things that would help us benchmark Google versus peers. First of all can you talk about the portion of ad growth or even the overall ad sales which are being driven by mobile? And also clearly there\u2019s some questioning of the notion that large amounts of offshore cash can be permanently reinvested. Can you tell us what portion of cash is now offshore and how we should think about international opportunities that might absorb these very large volumes of cash? Thanks. Patrick Pichette : Richard, thank you very much for the question. I think in terms of your question around Google Fiber, YouTube, content bundling, subscription, revenue streams, I think it\u2019s a very good question and I think it\u2019s an area where there\u2019s a lot of moment across the board where different people are trying different models, where cable is trying to provide content over the top, where YouTube is available on television screens, where people are trying to increase the broadband speeds because everybody gets the sense that we will consume more and more broadband content. I think what's clear to us in this process is that bandwidths will continue to increase. People\u2019s appetite for bandwidths will continue to grow up. It\u2019s clear that people will consume content more and more in a non-linear fashion. And its clear that content will come from different places, not just the traditional mechanisms of cable and television. So, I think that\u2019s pretty clear. It\u2019s also clear that people will monetize content both either in some form of payment or some form of advertising. Beyond that how all of this sort of coagulates and takes form still remains to be seen. I think it\u2019s fair to say, we are experimenting on different ends of the spectrum where we have like YouTube purely advertising based content and monetize today which is over the top which works on broadband. We have Google Fiber, we have channel bundle. So I think we are experimenting, we are playing in every space. And I think eventually the user will decide whatever is most convenient and most able to use, they will decide. But I think it\u2019s fair to say we have a horse in every one of these races. Patrick Pichette : That\u2019s terrific. Let me jump into the second question. I\u2019m going to once again kind of take a bit of exception through the premise of your argument about well how much is driven by mobile? We really are living in a multi-screen world. You start on mobile, you hop on tablet, you go to your desktop, you kind of come back to your television, you kind of Chromecast back to your TV, that\u2019s the world in which we live. And when people say, how much of your advertising is really driven by one? And we do a lot of research that actually shows that, in fact that\u2019s what we try to show to your advertisers is, how much attribution to kind of show to each of these elements which is in that chain of activities that actually leads to the end which is either a consumption of something or a purchase. So from that perspective that\u2019s why we don\u2019t actually talk about mobile as a percentage of ads. What really matters is that you have the footprint across all of these devices and modes to actually deliver the best answer to our users, and that\u2019s why you heard about IO continuing to kind of expand that landscape. In the case of CapEx in international, like last quarter our offer cash was about kind of 60% and 40% in the U.S. We\u2019ll share those numbers in our 10Q, so stay tuned. But in rough numbers that\u2019s really where we stand today. It may move a percentage, here and there. We do have great opportunities outside the U.S. as well to actually invest our cash whether it be through acquisitions. You\u2019ve seen a number of acquisitions in the last year that were made internationally as well as we\u2019re building datacenters outside of the U.S. where our headquarters in Ireland continues to grow and we\u2019re investing quite a bit of money there as well and to the real-estate. So, when you see our real-estate numbers, they may include over time a number of these projects in Ireland, but also in London and other places where we\u2019re investing. So, we actually have pretty exciting plans for our international portfolio both in APAC and in Europe. And so there\u2019s a real kind of great case to actually continue to keep this amount offshore. It\u2019s not a shortage of opportunities that we have. So it\u2019s just a question of pace and discipline. So, thank you for that. Richard Kramer : Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Richard. Maybe we have time for one more. We\u2019ll take one more question. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our final question from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Colin Sebastian : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First off, Nikesh, congratulations and good luck. Nikesh Arora : Thank you. Colin Sebastian : Firstly through Google Play and applications such as Shopping Express, there already is a transactional model in place in terms of purchases and payments. I guess, I wonder if it wouldn\u2019t be natural to assume that some of that transactional functionality could be extended to Google Shopping and PLA more broadly, or is it really about just driving traffic to third party sites for those businesses. And then secondly just a clarification on the cost per click breakout from the report, why aggregated cost per click year-over-year growth is actually better than individually the Google sites and the network sites? Thank you. Patrick Pichette : I can actually give you the answer to the last one and then you can come back. It\u2019s basically the Simpson's paradox. So, if you go on Wikipedia and you just check the Simpson's paradox you\u2019ll understand that you may have two factors that are actually correlated in the same directions. But when you actually put them together they actually may correlate in an inverse proportion, and that\u2019s where you get into the numbers and that\u2019s why you have this kind of, the discrepancy because we all kind of laughed at this number as well because when we saw it, we said hey, something doesn\u2019t add up and in fact it does add up. So, that\u2019s really the issue there Colin. And unless you already know the Simpson's paradox then don\u2019t go to Wikipedia. Colin Sebastian : I\u2019ll search Google first. Patrick Pichette : On the first question \u2026 Nikesh Arora : And on the first -- I\u2019m sorry. Patrick Pichette : Go ahead, Nikesh. Nikesh Arora : Okay. On the first question I think that\u2019s a fair observation Colin, and I think if you look at some of the applications that our payments team has developed are on InstaBuy, it\u2019s the ability to do a one click buy where we can partner with merchants and any kinds of transaction providers, where they don\u2019t have to keep entering their data or entering their credit card in different places. So, it gives them the comfort, ease of transaction. So, I think over time its kind of line an open system solution where we have platforms where retailers can work with us and pick and choose what part of our platform they want to leverage and our hope is to create a more and more friction less ability to create transactions which effectively benefits commerce and hopefully creates more revenue opportunities for us. Colin Sebastian : Great. Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Thanks, Colin. I usually kind of stop by kind of thanking all the Googlers, but Nikesh. Nikesh Arora : Yes, Patrick. I just wanted to also take a moment and thank everybody on the call for tolerating and enduring me on this call and supporting me over the last many years. Thank you everyone. I look forward to working with you in the future in a different role. Patrick Pichette : And with that, we\u2019re going to actually thank all the Googlers for their amazing work over the last 90 days. It\u2019s been a real rollercoaster. It\u2019s continuing with IO and everything else and we look forward to Q3. With that, Jamie -- again Nikesh all the best and Jamie I will let you close the call. Nikesh Arora : Thank you, Patrick. Operator : Thank you. Again, that does conclude today's conference. We do appreciate everyone\u2019s participation. Have a great day.",

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ellen West, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ellen West : Thank you, Jamie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Google's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us today are Patrick Pichette and Omid Kordestani. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. You can also visit our Google+ Investor Relations page for the latest Company news and updates. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today. Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected [Audio Gap] this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and, as applicable, other special items. We've also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick. Patrick Pichette : Thanks, Ellen. As some of you may know, we have a new leader in our Investor Relations team at Google. Her name is Ellen West. That\u2019s the great voice you just heard a minute ago, a second ago. Ellen is a long term Googler who joined us in 2007. Although she is here with us today in Mountain View, she is actually based out of New York and that will give us a bit more footprint on the East Coast as well. So, Ellen, welcome to the team. With that, let\u2019s dive into the details of Google\u2019s financial performance for Q3. Our gross total consolidated revenue grew a healthy 20% year-over-year to $16.5 billion and was up 4% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth would have been 19% year-over-year. Google sites revenue was also up 20% year-over-year to $11.3 billion and was up 3% quarter-over-quarter driven by the strength in our mobile search. Network revenue was up 9% year-over-year at $3.4 billion and was flat quarter-over-quarter driven by improved year-over-year growth in the AdMob and the Ad Exchange businesses. Finally, Google\u2019s other revenue grew a healthy 50% year-over-year to $1.8 billion and was up 15% quarter-over-quarter, this driven by year-over-year growth mainly from the Play Store but also complemented by an increase in licensing revenue. Our global aggregate paid click growth was strong this quarter, up 17% year-over-year and up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate CPCs were down only 2% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. And without currency fluctuations, aggregate cost per click would have been down 1%, and in fact, up 1% quarter-over-quarter. As we began to do in our last earnings call, we continue to disclose paid clicks and cost per click changes by property type as well in addition to the aggregate number. So to that end, Google sites paid clicks were up 24% year-over-year and up 4% quarter-over-quarter. Google sites CPC were down 4% year-over-year and down 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our network paid clicks were up 2% year-over-year and down 4% quarter-over-quarter and network CPCs were down 4% year-over-year but up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a number of factors including geographic mix, device mix, property mix as well as ongoing products and policy changes. Turning to geographic performance now, we saw solid performance in the U.S. as well as in the rest of the world. In our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you will see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., UK and the rest of the world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations. U.S. revenue was up 15% year-on-year to $7 billion. The UK was up 17% year-over-year to 1.6 billion and in fixed FX terms, the UK grew 10% year-over-year. In the UK, growth was impacted by a combination of factors this quarter including platform and property mix as well as tough comps from year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth rates for a number of reasons including for example weather. Our non-U.S. revenue excluding the UK was up 26% year-over-year to $7.9 billion. This accounted for 48% of total revenue which includes a 10 million benefit from our hedging program. In fixed FX terms in fact the rest of the world also grew 26% year-over-year, very healthy. Let me turn now to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion or 23% of total advertising revenue. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was 2.8 billion in Q3 which excludes stock-based compensation and also a non-cash impairment charge of 378 million related to a patent licensing royalty asset acquired as part of our Motorola Mobility purchase. Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled 5 billion, again excluding SBC. And as a result, our non-GAAP operating profit [Audio Gap] and our non-GAAP operating margin were 32% in Q3. Headcount was up roughly 3,000 in Q3. In total, we ended the quarter with approximately 55,000 full time employees. And please note that the headcount does include still approximately 3,500 full time employees from the Motorola business. In the past year, we continued to attract and hire the best talent from the best colleges and universities from all around the world. Continuing our past trend, graduate starts are much more heavily concentrated in Q3, which is part of why you are seeing the significant bump in headcount with the majority being tech hires, I want to kind of emphasize. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22% for Q3 and which includes the impact of the impairment charge that I mentioned earlier which is a non-deductible for income tax purposes. Let me turn now to cash management. OI&E or other income and expenses was $133 million. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging program. And for more details on OI&E, please do refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website. We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $6 billion. CapEx for the quarter was 2.4 billion. In this quarter the majority of the CapEx was related to our data center construction, production equipment and real estate purchases, in that order. It's important to remember that our infrastructure supports all of our products, whether they are core products like or Search or Ads, Maps or YouTube, but in addition to fueling our growth products like Photos and Hangouts, Google For Work and the Cloud platform. If you look at our data center announcements over the last four quarters, you will also see that we've been really busy with both groundbreakings and expansion all around the world including Finland, Taiwan, Singapore, recently announced Netherlands in addition to our ongoing investments in the U.S. In total, our free cash flow was then 3.6 billion. And before I close, I want to give a brief update on Motorola. The team continues to work hard and we look forward to seeing them join the Lenovo team soon. Motorola had a great Q3, with strong user reviews for products like the Moto X, Moto 360 and Moto Hint, clearly demonstrating the impressive momentum of the company. So there you have it. Strong results with continued strong growth in both revenue and profits and an optimism that provides us the confidence to fund strategic growth opportunities including the usual Android, Chromes and YouTube but also Google For Work and Cloud to name a few. Before I hand things over to Omid, I'd like to share with you some great news. I am really thrilled to announce that Omid is now officially Google's Chief Business Officer and this on a permanent basis. All of us at Google couldn't be happier to see Omid at his post running our business organization once again. And with that, I will turn it over to him for more details on our performance in the quarter. And after his remarks as usual, we will have Jamie open up the lines for your questions. Here you go, Omid. Omid Kordestani : Thank you very much, Patrick. And hello, everyone. I am Omid Kordestani. I am happy to be back at my new old job and thank you for joining us this afternoon. I joined Google back in 1999 to help get our business off the ground and led our business operations until 2009. Since then I have served as an advisor for Larry and outside Google actively helped many entrepreneurs. I am thrilled to be back at Google leading our global business again. We continue to have the same boundless energy and endless curiosity we've always had as a company and we are as focused as ever in our mission of making information useful and accessible to everyone. Case in point, we are really excited about this week's Android Lollipop launch. This is our largest release on Android ever with over 5,000 APIs for developers. It adds new features including better notifications, battery life and security and introduces a refreshed, consistent visual style. And alongside the new devices Nexus 6, Nexus 9 and Nexus Player, consumers in India who bought the recently announced Android One will get the update to the latest software at the same time. Now I\u2019ll do a quick walk through of the business highlights from Q3. As usual, we\u2019ll give an overview of these four areas, performance and brand advertising, our advertising platforms and our emerging non-ads businesses. Let\u2019s start with performance advertising, the core of our business. People want the right information at the right time. They don\u2019t want to have to think about whether it\u2019s on the web or in an app. We\u2019ve learned this first hand as a developer of many services, Maps, YouTube, Gmail that also are some of the world\u2019s most popular mobile apps. With that in mind, we have a simple goal with performance ads : help marketers connect with customers at the right moment to drive measurable results. Our partners have driven hundreds of millions of app downloads with AdMob on our click to download formats. But most mobile apps are downloaded, used once and eventually deleted. So we launched new features to help advertisers re-engage with users post download. For example, advertisers can now deep link from their search ads directly into their mobile apps. To succeed with multi-screen marketing, advertisers also need modern measurement tools so they can understand when their ads drive phone calls from customers resulting conversions on other devices or lead to store visits and purchases. Last October we announced estimated total conversions, our effort to help marketers better measure the value of their multi-screen advertising. We\u2019ve worked to continue developing this product and launched cost device measurement for display ads. Clients have already found that mobile display campaigns drive 15% more conversions than they had previously measured. Let\u2019s shift gears to talk about our shopping efforts. [Audio Gap] with performance ads we are directly connecting people with [Audio Gap] and then enabling them to buy and have them delivered. We keep making improvements to our products to help retailers. Keeping inventory organized and up to date is a constant challenge for retailers. We help them manage this issue by completing the transition of product listing ads to our shopping campaigns platform. And finally, people often want to find stores near them to make a purchase in person. We\u2019ve long had local inventory ads that enabled merchants to show customers this information in the U.S. and we launched these in the UK, France, Germany, Japan and Australia last quarter. In summary, the core of our business, performance advertising, continues to deliver great results. Let\u2019s move on now to our brand business. Our objective is clear here, make digital the best possible canvas for creative and effective brand-building campaigns. First let\u2019s talk about YouTube. Any conversation about great advertising starts with great content. On YouTube, stars produce amazing content that our users love from Bethany Mota to Smosh to Mental Floss. Earlier this year we launched Google Preferred to help connect brands with premium ad inventory on our most popular YouTube channels. Since then we have secured upfront commitments from top media agencies. We\u2019re just getting started with YouTube and its potential. We\u2019ve sold out the majority of our U.S. Google Preferred offering which represents among the top 5% of popular channels inventory on YouTube. And as a result of terrific brand events in Germany, France, UK and Australia, we\u2019re seeing tremendous interest from local agency partners around the world. Last quarter we also saw some great progress in our brand efforts beyond YouTube. We launched new ad formats customized for mobile screens. We also announced an expansion of YouTube\u2019s TrueView ads into AdMob's network of more than 650,000 mobile apps. Everyday our teams work to develop both the products and terrific partner relationships that enable us to tackle any digital marketing challenge across multiple channels together. With encouragement from Google and YouTube, ABC executed a digital first marketing plan for their new fall TV line up. Their effort included custom five second-ads for TrueView and collaborations with homegrown YouTube stars. We\u2019re very excited about the new deal with Mondelez and Starcom MediaVest. This global agreement will focus on video and display and is Mondelez\u2019s largest digital media deal ever. Next let\u2019s take a look at one of the fastest growing parts of digital advertising world, programmatic platforms for agencies and publishers. For many years now our goal has been to provide world class technology for brands, agencies and publishers who power their ads businesses. Today our DoubleClick suite is used by all major agencies and we\u2019re particularly focused on multi-screen and video. DoubleClick Bid Manager is the go-to tool for marketers and agencies to navigate the rapidly growing programmatic advertising space. It\u2019s doubled in size year-over-year by impression volume and we really love the progress we see here. For publishers, we help them make money from their content via our publisher tools from our Ads Exchange to customized private exchanges which complement our core offerings. This quarter we signed new private advertising exchange deals with publishers like Fox TV and Edmunds. This helps publishers generate revenue from premium ad space. We have nearly doubled the number of private [Audio Gap] our system year-over-year. Finally, we\u2019re seeing remarkable momentum in our newer non-ads businesses, whether it\u2019s Play, Hardware or Google For Work, we continue to see strong growth and we\u2019re thrilled to be a platform for our partners' successes as well. Google Play\u2019s growth continues to impress. It\u2019s a linchpin of the amazing Android ecosystem. We brought Play Music to 17 new countries, bringing the total to 45 and our expansion continues. Today, Play Movies is available in 93 countries and Play Books is available in 61 countries. On the hardware front, just yesterday, we unveiled three fantastic new Nexus devices, Nexus 6 phone, Nexus 9 tablet and Nexus [Audio Gap] and Android powered streaming media player. This quarter we worked with HP, Toshiba and Acer to introduce five new Chromebook devices and teamed up with Asus, LG, Motorola, Samsung and Sony to help launch new Android Wear devices. We\u2019re also selling Chromebook in six new countries. They\u2019re now available in 31 countries around the world. And we sold more than 1 million Chromebooks for education this quarter, even more than last quarter. Chromecast celebrated its first birthday this past quarter. It\u2019s been a smashing success. Users have hit the cast button more than 400 million times since it launched to enjoy their favorite sports, music, premium movies and TV shows. In September, we added even more content to Chromecast, including Disney content. And we were so proud to launch Android One, an effort to make high quality low cost smartphones available to as many people as possible. We started in India and we\u2019ll be expanding to other countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines in the coming months. For businesses, what was called Google Enterprise, is now simply Google for Work. This business has great traction. In addition to the tremendous growth in our Apps business, we have more than 1,800 signups for Google Drive for Work every week. Plus there are almost 250 billion active Google Drive users, including consumer, education and business users. We continue to invest in our growing Cloud platform business, helping developers realize the promise of cloud computing by providing affordable on-demand access to world-class technology. We recently announced Google Cloud Platform for Startups and offer up to $100,000 in credits to enable the best and brightest startups to use Google\u2019s Cloud platform. Sony Music recently built an interactive app in less than three weeks using App Engine to engage fans tuning into One Direction Day, an eight-hour YouTube livestream featuring the band, one of the largest ever YouTube music live streams. Lastly, our marketing team had a great quarter as well. Google My Business helped more small businesses get online. And our Art, Copy & Code project showed advertisers the creative potential of digital marketing. And from the annual Google Science Fair to more recent campaigns showcasing amazing content on Play, YouTube stars and the power of the Google App, the magic of Google was on prominent display. All told, it was another terrific quarter at Google, continued momentum in our core business and exciting innovation in new areas. Kudos to the Googlers around the world who made it all happen. I\u2019ll turn it over to Patrick to wrap up and start our Q&A. Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Omid. So Jamie, if you want to give us the instructions then we\u2019ll get going on the Q&A. Operator : Thank you (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the questions. So, first one, maybe with the announcement that you\u2019re expanding Google Shopping Express into other cities and rebranding it and new retailers are coming on, [Audio Gap] what you saw on those first few cities to think about extending it further into the other cities. And what you might be hearing from feedback from retailers about adopting the platform because a few also dropped off the platform at the same time? Just wanted to get a little bit better color about how that was developing and how you were going to go forward with it. Thanks. Omid Kordestani : Thank you very much, Eric. So, we're really trying to learn a lot here. Innovation is a messy process and especially with Google Express here. There is a lot of understanding that we need to have on improving efficiency in the logistics process, trying to find price points that shoppers find attractive. And our goal is really to help the over 35 merchant partners succeed and reach their customers. And I'm a user of it and I am really impressed by how much time it saves. I see the cars running around the city around me. And I think our goal is really to take it a step at a time and see the success, understand the logistical operations, how much it costs us to do this and can we deliver this basically in a successful way. Patrick Pichette : Just Eric, just a couple of kind of additional points; one is, clearly we\u2019ve announced this week three other cities. So if you go back to the fundamental premise of [Audio Gap] which is the first thing was would people show up and want this product. It\u2019s very clear people want this product. The second one was -- and that\u2019s why we\u2019re expanding the product. The second question then is, we've had a lot of questions about monetization, and we've announced this week we're taking real actions on the monetization service, both including commissions on each transaction from merchants, but also service fees that were announced as well. So from that perspective, we kind of think of it as now we're in Phase II of this product where according to our business plan we continue to kind of look for the barriers, the milestones, and then when we hit those milestones, we with enthusiasm keep on going. All this to say, it is nevertheless a scale business, so working on efficiencies, working on all of the issues that are related to logistics continues to be a big focus of ours. And on the partners, I mean we're really thrilled to have the partners we have. You can expect as we kind of grow through this that we have a few coming in, a few coming out, but overall very, very pleased with the trajectory there. And so I think you should see the announcements of this week as this kind of sign of optimism and momentum in it. Thank you so much for your question, Eric. Eric Sheridan : Great. Patrick Pichette : Jamie, let's go to our next question. Operator : And we'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : Thank you. I'm wondering if you can help us at all segregate the search business from other items in Google website and just give us your view on the health of the search business. And then comment a little bit on the paid click deceleration, what's driving that? And do you even see that as an important metric? Thank you. Patrick Pichette : So I'll take that. The two points is, one, look, we don't give the breakdown of the Google sites, but actually it's pretty healthy on all dimensions. I think that from that perspective, search is going well. And all of the other dimensions of our sites have actually doing pretty well, and that's what you see in our kind of 20% year-over-year just for sites growth. So from that perspective, I think that we're pretty happy on that front. On the CPC issue, it's pretty simple. I mean we really had -- again, you have to think of the CPC and the volume as one basket that actually delivers. So monetization overall is still very strong. We're very happy with the monetization, Jamie. And if we have in one quarter kind of movements between one and the other, that's just basically the continued experimentation and the impact of all the factors that I usually talk about. So from that perspective, there was nothing noteworthy to kind of mention this quarter. We're very happy with the trends in both cases. Justin Post : Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Thanks, Jamie. Jamie, we'll go to our next question. Sorry, Justin, I meant. Jamie, we'll go to our next question. Operator : And we'll go next to [Stephen Zhu] (ph) with Credit Suisse. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, thanks. So I think in the past you've talked about the opportunity cost of not being there for the user when they're trying to access your products and services as a rationale for making investments. So is there any data you can share on your newest users in the emerging markets who are going straight to mobile? Is it safe to assume that consumption from these new users are running at a pretty similar growth trajectory with what you've seen historically on a desktop and as well as your established markets? Or is their engagement with all of your products more intense? And is there anything you can say in terms of what areas of your business are seeing the more intense level of investments? Is it more your consumer-focused initiatives or more your enterprise-focused cloud initiatives? Thank you. Patrick Pichette : So a couple points there, and then if Omid has additional comments. One is clearly emerging businesses -- emerging markets are just fundamentally different than the more developed markets, if you think of a country like Indonesia or India where people go straight to mobile. And so in that context, there's clearly a lot of differences between those markets and how they're evolving compared to what would have been 10 years ago the UK or the U.S. So from that perspective, I think that -- and that's why you see us launch things like Android One, right? When you have 1 billion -- just under 2 billion people around the world that have already smartphones, the vast majority of the population looks for things online. So these kind of initiatives that we're launching is the most important piece. From an investment at Google, we're investing -- without giving you all the details, we're clearly investing in our core business. It remains the focus of our activities. But if you look across -- as Omid mentioned, he mentioned the Cloud business, the Google For Work business, all of these other areas, the Play business, the Hardware business, these are all areas where we're investing and we're investing with enthusiasm with each their own specific business case, each of them are actually looking for what is their growth and profitability models and we just monitor them pretty tightly. Okay, so you're welcome. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please. Operator : And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney : Hey, Patrick, in describing the Google search strength, you said you saw particular strength in mobile search. Could you elaborate? Patrick Pichette : Yeah. I mean, look, it's very clear that mobile is still a big part of our growth. And we're very pleased about it. I mean, it's -- but when we talk about mobile, I think there's a couple things. One is you have to continue to look at both the growth in volume and the growth in pricing. So these are long-term trends that we're seeing. The CPCs and the clicks, they can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. It just happens that we've made some changes this quarter that improved the mobile pricing while impacting the lower quality clicks and that's what you see a bit reflected in our numbers. And again, and I wouldn't -- just as an overall statement, remember to everybody that I wouldn't attribute the aggregate CPC movement [Audio Gap] mobile, because there's still a full factor mix that -- as I talked in my remarks about geography and about our product changes. And so all this actually makes a big factor as well. So that's what we've seen in the strength in mobile, but we're still very pleased with the momentum. Thanks, Mark. Jamie, we'll go to our next question, please. Operator : And we'll go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Ross Sandler : Thanks, guys. I just had two questions, first on the UK and then second on mobile payments. So the UK growth, looks like it's dropping off pretty hard on an ex-FX basis, either one-year or two-year growth rates. So I think this is an economy that folks generally think is supposed to be holding up pretty well. So can you talk about what you're seeing in the UK? You had mentioned weather and a few other things, but a little bit more color on what's going on with the ad market in the UK. And then mobile payments, that's an area that's getting a lot of attention lately. Can you just give us an update on where the Google Wallet team stands and what kind of traction you're seeing in terms of user adoption and maybe how you plan on addressing merchant payments kind of outside of in-app or things from the app store? Thank you. Patrick Pichette : So, Ross, why don't I take the first question and then Omid will give you the answer on the second? As we talk about the UK, a couple points are worth note. One is, the UK contributed roughly 10% of our total revenue this quarter, and that's been the same for kind of the past many quarters. And in fact, if you go back years, it will still be in the same range. So there's nothing kind of fundamental that -- it's worth noting that it's still a pretty good market with decent growth. The issue of deceleration this quarter specifically, on platform -- I mean I mentioned a number of elements, right? So platform mix, we do see [Audio Gap] of desktop, tablet searches having a greater impact in UK than anywhere else that we see in our network of countries. On property mix, remember we talked about this also on prior calls. AFS as a business has much bigger part of our both UK and U.S. business, so it will skew to those geographies. And so those are kind of some of the elements. And as I mentioned, year-over-year comps were difficult. And then if you have a great summer in terms of weather or bad summer in weather, it can have some real impact on the growth rates as well. So it's a combination of a number of factors that the UK has driven our performance, but still pretty pleased. But I won't -- that's really what's going on there. In terms of the payments, I'll let Omid give you an update there. Omid Kordestani : Hi, Ross. I think our goal here is really achieving mass merchant adoption, so the availability of these NFC devices is about that and also making it easier for consumers to replace their wallets with their smartphones hopefully more and more over time. So reducing friction in everyday shopping experiences is how we approach it and the focus on the user and we're really developing a fully functional payment system. So, as you may know, users can send money today to friends through Gmail using the Wallet app. We have loyalty and gift cards that can be stored in the Wallet app. The Buy with Google button makes it possible for users to make purchases very quickly with two clicks. So, again, it's this two-fronted focus on merchant adoption and removing the friction for users. Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Thanks, Ross. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please. Operator : And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Ben Schachter : Omid, after many years of waiting for television budgets to shift online, it appears to be happening in a more accelerated fashion. So, one, do you agree with that? And two, could you just discuss YouTube's positioning versus competitors and in particular Facebook Video? And then Patrick, a couple of quick ones for you. One, given the evolution of tax laws in Europe, how are you and how should we be thinking about Google's tax rate over the coming years? And then also just any comments on stock comp being particularly high this quarter? Thanks. Omid Kordestani : Thank you, Ben. This is Omid. So the way we look at it is that users are really accessing Internet on large screens with high broadband speeds, and we're getting great monetization on these screens and advertisers are really paying attention. So we have seen a real shift where marketers and agencies who have historically built their brands on TV are really reorienting this toward investments on digital. And as in regards to YouTube, our focus here is really this focus on investments and more content, more creativity. And I think you also mentioned that you had a Facebook comment. What they are doing I think in video has always helped us with bringing more attention and more innovation to the space, so we welcome that. And the way we're going to approach it is just continue to investing in our platform and on the creators and building better and better monetization solutions. Just again, you may know some of these metrics, but I'll say it again that we have 400 hours of content that are uploaded every minute and partner revenue is up 60% from 2012 to 2013 on YouTube. Patrick Pichette : Great. Let me jump, Ben, on the -- your two specific questions. [Audio Gap] tax issues, you've heard about the Ireland announcement earlier this week on the double Irish tax structure. I mean, for us, we've always said that it's for politicians to decide what laws they want to put and then for companies just to comply with those laws. And that's what we're basically doing. So we're deeply committed to Ireland. We've worked there for many years. We have a great -- that's our headquarters. We have over 2,500 employees there. And so from that perspective we're committed to the place. And we're going to work with the authorities just to kind of get clarifications over this. But it's really way too early to tell what's going to happen. So we're, just like you, getting the information, the news, and we're going to work with the authorities to understand it better and then comply with the laws. In terms of stock-based compensation, just a few notes on this one for this quarter. We have -- it's the time of year where we do equity refresh. And from a timing perspective last year, we did the equity refresh in Q2 instead of Q3. So there's kind of like a geography of Q2 versus Q3 that kind of hit us in Q3. In addition to this, if you go to our filings, you'll see that our executive compensation -- so think of the top 15 or top 20, I can't remember the exact numbers, but it's stated there \u2013 that they do their refreshes every two years and it happens to be this quarter as well. And then finally, I mean, we obviously have more employees. So it's just a compounding set of factors, Ben, that I kind of lumped it all into Q3. So it's no more, no less than that on that -- on that one. Ben Schachter : Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Thanks for your question. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please. Operator : And we'll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Anthony DiClemente : Thanks a lot. Just on core operating expenses, is there anything [Audio Gap] Patrick that you might call out in terms of expense growth in the quarter as you have operating deleverage through the P&L? Just wondering, going forward, if that's likely to continue. And then a question for Omid I suppose on YouTube. You mentioned -- I know that YouTube's investing in its studio as a way to help along new talent, new homegrown talent onto the platform directly. I'm wondering if you can talk about the multichannel networks, how YouTube's relationships with the multichannel networks, the MCNs, are evolving at a high level? How you guys think about that dynamic between the homegrown YouTube talent itself as compared to talent that resides on the MCNs? Thanks. Patrick Pichette : Okay. Anthony, thank you for your question. Why don't I jump in right now on just expenses for the quarter? I think if I had two comments to make on expenses in the quarter, you may notice that relative to a few models that I saw out there, R&D was higher and other areas are a bit lower. And I just want to highlight that we hire and we focus clearly our hiring in our tech payroll, or think of it as all of our engineering. And that skews to R&D. So as we bring on people and we push forward the growth of our -- we really focus it in the areas that are going to make a fundamental difference to Google, which is engineering, and by doing so, it kind of skews to R&D. So that's why R&D may be a bit higher than expected by some models out there. And so that's one piece. And then the other one is just wanted to reiterate that it's very clearly an extraordinary quarter from a hiring perspective for the comments I've made before. And so we're kind of clearly seeing that. But at the same time I wouldn't say that this is clearly a new run rate for us or anything like that. It just happened that most of these college students end up landing in Q3 and we have the result of a banner year from a hiring perspective all through. It takes a year to hire them all and then they come into this quarter. So that's really kind of the two big elements that have actually flowed, Anthony, through our P&L this quarter. I'll let Omid answer the YouTube question. Omid Kordestani : Yes. Anthony, so, again, we have a very, very partnership minded organization here and company as a whole. So we view MCNs as -- or organizations that are really going to help develop a great content, support the creators on YouTube. Just like we are doing that with YouTube Studios, I think MCNs can help a lot of these become future stars hopefully and develop more success. So just we view it as another form of partnership that we need to pay attention to and support. So that's how we look at it. Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Anthony. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please. Operator : And we'll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein. Carlos Kirjner : Thank you. I have two questions. Patrick, is CapEx still driven by real estate and construction? And if yes, can you explain in a bit more detail what changed about 18 months ago in the way you acquired real estate and build to drive the inflection in capital intensity that we have seen? It looks like you operated for more than 10 years in one way and then there was a shift that has led to this massive inflection. So what happened there? Secondly, do you think that Google login is adopted or inspired to being adopted by a large enough number of important mobile apps for you to be competitive in the long term when it comes to offering mobile [Audio Gap] and can you give us an update on the developer adoption of deep linking? Thank you. Patrick Pichette : So I can certainly take the first and let Omid answer the second. I've made that comment before in a prior quarter, Carlos. The CapEx intensity and our CapEx program has been built by a combination of, as I mentioned in previous quarter, catching up when we were running too hot in terms of tightening of capacity. And so -- and once I'm very happy that when we really torque our utilization rates, on the other side it creates a lot of operational issues. And that led us to believe that in fact investing ahead of the curve was actually a strategic imperative for us to make sure that if we have the extra capacity, we will grow into it. And I think the difference between -- certainly on the data center side, data center construction and machines, and you'll have noticed that this quarter again, there are priorities. If you look at the nomenclature I gave, construction of data center is the primary. So it is the core infrastructure, it's groundbreaking and it is setting up the core infrastructures. Machine was the second one for this quarter, but you'll notice that it flip flops real estate. In the case of the real estate, we have been investing for our campus and otherwise when we see -- when we hit kind of minimum scale, we need to kind of make investments in real estate. And again with an eye of looking for the long term, rather than just filling at least for the next 12 months or 24 months, because once you kind of -- if you decide you're going to grow in a place, then you need the capacity for multi-years. So all of these factors have actually kind of been the driver for the shift in capital intensity that you've seen over the last 18 months. So that's basically the explanation, Carlos. I'll let Omid kind of jump on the second question about the mobile question. Omid Kordestani : Sure. Thanks, Carlos. So the AdMob network reaches 900 million unique devices per month and our own apps are hugely popular, Gmail, Maps, Google App and YouTube. And our focus is also -- is helping developers generate app downloads and re-engagement with users who have already downloaded their apps, as I mentioned in my remarks earlier. And we're really helping drive hundreds of millions of app downloads through app promotion products. Again, the goal here is that you just search and not worry about where the answer is either on a webpage or on an app. And we've been in this game for a while. Four years ago, we acquired AdMob and have continued to invest in this space heavily. And this quarter, we launched the next generation of these promotion ads across Google search, Google Display Network, and YouTube. So we're really focused on this area to help the developers and our users. Patrick Pichette : I think we can clearly say that we're pretty pleased with the developer adoption of this. They see a huge benefit, so they're actually investing in it. Thank you, Carlos. Carlos Kirjner : Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Jamie, let's go to our next question, please. Operator : And we'll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : Thanks for taking the question. Just two for Omid. First, you talked about estimated conversions and seeing a 15% increase there. Can you just talk about whether you think that's actually leading to more spend at this point from advertisers? And then, secondly, are you seeing mobile like-for-like pricing improvements at this point? And what gives you the confidence in mobile closing the gap with desktop over time? Omid Kordestani : Thanks, Douglas. Both are really good questions that are related really. I think the way this is going to play out is that I think advertisers are going to, with these tools, be able to just understand conversions better -- where is it happening? And then the dynamics of how those changes is all the way back to adjusting bids and then paying attention to where the conversions are coming from. So, again, I think just to maybe highlight some examples for you, we have a fashion retailer Express who's an early tester, found that the overall return on their ad spend doubled when offline sales were included in their online advertising results. So we're just continuing to invest here and get this right. It's too early to figure out the impact exactly on revenue, but we expect the estimated total conversions to help the advertisers fully measure this and ultimately adjust their bidding and just get much more sophisticated in these measurements. I hope that answers. Douglas Anmuth : And mobile on a like-for-like basis? Omid Kordestani : The way we're focusing this is that users really are using their screens interchangeably simultaneously throughout the day and that we really are not at this point doing this like-by-like comparisons or comment on it because we think it's still early and we're really focused on just again delivering the results. And it took many years, for example, for the desktop ecosystem to develop the right ad formats and really take advantage of the platform. So I think we just need to continue innovating here, experimenting here to get it right. Douglas Anmuth : Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Thanks, Douglas. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please. Operator : And we'll go next to Mark May with Citi. Mark May : Thanks for taking my question. One on -- there's been quite a bit of attention paid to cloud services space and Google in particular. Wondering if you can comment a little bit around the traction that you're getting with the Compute Engine? And what sort of impact that that's having on revenue or expenses and CapEx for the business? And then secondly, I think earlier you made a comment around some changes you've made in mobile that have impacted some of your network click metrics, so hoping you could elaborate a bit more on that. Patrick Pichette : Okay. Do you want me to... Omid Kordestani : Go ahead. Patrick Pichette : I'll just jump on the cloud and then the last piece and then maybe -- I wasn't sure what the very first part of your question, Mark, was. But clearly, cloud is an area that is kind of booming, right? We know that the long-term trends are very clear for us, which is the vast majority of businesses. Everybody is moving their infrastructures to the cloud. So -- and it is an area where we have fundamentally great assets to contribute to this industry, both in terms of the flexibility, the cost structure, the technology, and that's why we're investing heavily in there. We're seeing great progress from an adoption perspective, signing up new customers. And from a CapEx, obviously you need to kind of -- that's one of them that as I mentioned on the CapEx story with Carlos a few minutes ago, if you do take off and you really get the kind of customer adoption that you expect, if you don't have the capacity in place, it can have a really important kind of differential in your success. So there is one that we're keeping a pretty close eye on from a CapEx perspective in making sure that we have the option value. The third question was mobile that have network clicks. So, yeah, I mean, clicks and CPCs always fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. It just happens that we've made some -- as I mentioned, made some changes this quarter that improved our mobile pricing while impacting low quality clicks. So sometimes, it goes -- if you think of a long-term trend in the mobile sector piece of our product, sometimes you kind of put a new change in the network and it creates a lot of clicks for it, but then the CPCs are much lower. And then if it doesn't actually create something that's really good for the user, you need to kind of pull back on it, and that's what you've heard, for example, just parallel to the AFS business. So it's kind of constantly fluctuating. What's really important us is really the combined volume and pricing growth. And so for us, it's very clear that we're doing some great work in this area and monetization in aggregate is doing very well. And that's really what we're -- like on a quarter-to-quarter basis, don't panic about little movements here and there. Look at the fundamental trends, and that's where we're very pleased. Now, did you have a first -- was there a first question that I missed, Mark? Mark May : No. I was hoping on cloud that maybe you could put some numbers behind the level of traction in terms of number of customers impact on expenses, CapEx, the level of investment in the cloud. Patrick Pichette : I see. Okay. So I've given you what I can give you on that. Again, we're really thrilled by the momentum there and our focus in that area. Mark May : Thanks. Patrick Pichette : Thanks, Mark. Jamie, we'll go to our next question, please. Operator : And we'll go next to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Peter Stabler : Thanks for taking the question. One for Omid. Going back to estimated total conversions, wondering if we could expect Adometry to be integrated into the DoubleClick platform and how that may or may not work with the estimated total conversions tool? And then, finally, I'm wondering [Audio Gap] on your work around coming up with a solution that reduces the dependence upon cookies and perhaps introduces a cross-platform, a cross-device ID for Google and what impact that could have in the market? Thank you. Omid Kordestani : Sure. I think -- again, it's early for us to call Adometry. It's a great attribution solution and we've been investing in that tool for a long time now and trying to just get this right by all the innovation that's happening within Google and just really understanding the impact of these usage models and -- between the mobile devices and desktop. And so I think we're going to look at everything that's available out there, both what we're developing and partners out there that we could partner with, and continue to invest here. It's going to take us a while, just like we experienced before with search, to get this right and have a real end-to-end solution for marketers and publishers. And so I think you will see a lot of innovation in this space. What Facebook recently announced is another approach. And we're going to study that and just figure out what is the right set of offerings from us. So I guess, unfortunately, I can't give you a very specific answer here. But I think what you'll see from us is pay a huge amount of attention here, make the measurements and see the impact and then offer a full suite to our customers. Patrick Pichette : Yeah. So just basically, too early to speculate on these issues, but clearly it's an area of focus at the company. Thank you, Peter. Jamie, our next question, please? Operator : And we'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you. I had two questions. The first was a follow-up on Google Shopping Express. I mean, just wondering, when you think about what Amazon is doing with same-day delivery, they're obviously building these fulfillment centers themselves, which theoretically should give them scale over time. I'm wondering if you could share with us how you see this evolving for Google over time? And then a follow-up question would just be related to your comments about payments. And I'm just wondering, how critical is it for Google itself to [Audio Gap] friction that you're seeing with kind of a ubiquitous digital wallet? Or would you be fine with a third-party doing so for the Android platform? Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Heather. I'll take the first and then let Omid answer the second. Clearly, Google Shopping Express, there is an issue of scale and it's a combination of an issue of scale, tools and efficiency. I mean, that's how you, if you think over time, can end up with a product that you can deliver within kind of hours at the right value and where you can make money. So it's not only about -- yes, for efficiencies you need centralization. You need a bunch of distribution tools that actually work. We're clearly focused on that as well. I mean it is part of the business case that we're building. But you need more than that. There's a lot of other elements as well. So clearly focused like our competitors would be. And our announcements today, again kind of our -- was it yesterday -- yesterday's announcements on Shopping Express kind of tell you that we are investing both for -- the three new cities kind of give you a hint of, yes, it's about scale. So clearly we're focused on that. Omid Kordestani : Yeah. And Heather, on the wallet question, I think we're going to continue to be open here. So we are trying to get it right and innovating on multiple fronts, as I mentioned earlier. And if partnering makes sense, we'll take a look at it, as well. So -- and the goal is here really to provide this very seamless experience for the users and then get the merchant adoption and hopefully get this right. I'm certainly delighted every time I use this and it works. And I think if we can all get the ecosystem right and there are multiple players in it and partnerships that are making it happen, we're definitely open to that. Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Heather. Let's go to our next question. Operator : And we'll go next to Paul Vogel with Barclays. Paul Vogel : Yeah. Great. Thank you very much. As Google Play has grown, I'm just wondering if you could talk about the relationships with the carriers and how that's evolving over time. Patrick Pichette : Yeah, I can answer that. So, essentially, Google Play is doing great and everybody wants to kind of be part of this answer. And so, for our carriers, [Audio Gap] basis. So the real question is, what's the win-win? And so they're all done individually. We have great partnerships with many carriers that actually fuel this, and we're including carrier billing. So all this actually is just a very, very positive ecosystem for us. And so we're totally thrilled to have these partnerships and we expect to continue to do so. Paul Vogel : Thanks. Patrick Pichette : Thanks, Paul. Jamie, one more question. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Brian Pitz with Jefferies. Brian Pitz : Great. Thanks for the questions. Two for video -- on video for Omid. You mentioned Google Preferred in your comments. Any color on further expanding the upfront process with the ad agencies? Basically, do you anticipate that upwards of 5% to 10% of your top inventory could actually be set aside for preferred longer-term? And then just given the shift of offline TV dollars to online, as you've mentioned, any comments on political specifically or other new categories more aggressively moving on to YouTube? Thanks so much. Omid Kordestani : Sure. Thank you, Brian. So we secured upfront commitments from five top agencies : IPG, OMD, Digitas, Carat, SMG, and some major brands like General Motors and Coca-Cola and we were actually very, very pleased with how Google Preferred was experienced and adopted. And so I think we're going to definitely continue working on this. And also if you look at our history, we're very used to the selling model that was all about performance. And then as we added properties like YouTube and Brand and Mobile, we're just getting more and more now gaining a better understanding of how to work in this upfront process, for example, to offer the marketers this incredible asset that we have in YouTube and our network. So we're going to just continue getting better at -- on the products side, figure out how to package this inventory better, and then the tools that are needed, and then on the selling side, just get better at also working with the agencies and our advertisers and marketers to get this type of selling right. And on the political vertical, I think clients love to use our products as part of their campaigns for federal, local, state campaigns and it is a really great area for us. We have actually a political sales team that's focused on it. So I think you'll see more of that effort from us. Brian Pitz : Omid, thanks. Omid Kordestani : Thank you very much. Patrick Pichette : Thanks, Brian. Jamie, that's all the time we have. So if you don't mind, I'd just like to close by reiterating what Omid said a bit earlier. This quarter was a great quarter with great momentum again. And I just wanted to thank all the great efforts of our Googlers around the world who make us look good on this call because of their fantastic effort. So with that, Jamie, I'll let you close the call, and have a happy Q4 everyone. Operator : Thank you again. That does conclude today's conference. We do appreciate everyone's participation.",

At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ellen West, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ellen West : Thanks so much, Jamie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Google\u2019s fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us today are Patrick Pichette and Omid Kordestani. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today. Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking including statements regarding Google\u2019s future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and, as applicable, other special items. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick. Patrick Pichette : Thanks, Ellen. And welcome to 2015 everyone. Before we get into the numbers, I am going to give a brief overview of our performance this quarter, as the data is actually quite noisy through the P&L. So to start, let\u2019s say, that we saw continued strength in our core advertising business. This was really driven by a strong holiday and mobile performance from our Sites line. We saw a great momentum in our programmatic business highlighted by our mobile display and our ads platform product. But we also faced a few real challenges as well. On the revenue side, clearly as you heard out the strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in a gross negative currency impact of $616 million just into Q4. But thanks to our hedging program the net impact was actually attenuated, with a net revenue impact of $468 million. Also on the Other Revenue line not only did we see that negative currency impact really impact the Play growth, particularly in Japan, but also while the Nexus 7 was very well received as a new phone, we had real issues and unable to secure sufficient inventory to meet the demand that we had forecasted. So for both these factors in fact, we see lower other revenue growth this quarter. On the expense side, we had number of unusual charges to our operating expenses hit this quarter. I\u2019ll provide you more details in a few minutes as we go through the conversation. But together these items added up to slightly over $300 million in expenses to our P&L. Lastly, if you go through the CapEx line, you will note that we\u2019ve made real estate purchases in Q4, which helped us relieve both pressure on our work space for current employees but also to accommodate our future growth. And this also resulted in a large sequential increase in our real estate capital expenditures this quarter. So now that you have the basics, why don\u2019t we dive into the details? Our gross total consolidated revenue grew 15% year-over-year to $18.1 billion, and it was up 10% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations our gross consolidated revenue growth would have, in fact, been 18% year-over-year. And despite all the FX pressure our Google Sites revenue was up a healthy 18% year-over-year to $12.4 billion, was up 10% quarter-over-quarter, in part driven by the strength in our mobile search. Network revenue was up 6% year-over-year at $3.7 billion and was up 8% quarter-over-quarter. As a reminder, our network business includes really two types of businesses with different growth profiles, our legacy AdSense business, particularly AdSense for search, where we\u2019ve continued to make policy changes for the benefit of our user experience, but which has negatively impacted the growth in clicks specifically. Our clean-up efforts have resulted in fewer clicks, but also higher CPCs as I\u2019ll discuss in a minute. The other business that in the network line are newer display and programmatic businesses including AdMob, AdExchange, DoubleClick Bid Manager, and these continue to grow at a strong rate. Finally, Google\u2019s other revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $2 billion was up 6% quarter-over-quarter, driven by year-over-year growth in our Play Store, but offset by the FX impact and the challenges in our hardware business I mentioned earlier. Our global aggregate paid clicks were up 14% year-over-year, and up 11% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate CPCs were down 3% year-over-year and also down 3% quarter-over-quarter. And if we go on our monetization by property, the Google site paid clicks were up 25% year-over-year and up 18% quarter-over-quarter. With Google sites\u2019 CPCs were down 8% year-over-year and down 8% quarter-over-quarter. On the network side, network paid clicks were down 11% year-over-year and down 7% quarter-over-quarter, but our network CPCs were up year-over-year 6% and 10% quarter-over-quarter for the reasons I mentioned. Our monetization metrics continued to be impacted by a number of factors. They include geographic mix, device mix, property mix, FX, as well as ongoing product and policy changes. Turning to geographic performance, if you go to our earning slides, which you\u2019ll find on our Investor Relation website, you\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve broken down our revenues by US, UK and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations. So despite large currency headwinds we saw solid performance from our core advertising business around the world. The US revenue was up 14% year-over-year to $7.9 billion. The UK was up 10% year-over-year to $1.7 billion. And in fixed FX term it actually grew to 11% year-over-year. Non-US revenue excluding the UK was up 18% year-over-year to $8.6 billion, accounting for 47% of total revenue. And in fixed FX terms in fact the rest of the world grew at healthy 24% year-over-year. So let me turn now to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.6 billion or 22% of advertising revenue. Our non-GAAP other costs of revenue was $3.1 billion in Q4, which exclude SBC as well. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $5.8 billion, again excluding stock-based compensation. And as a result our non-GAAP operating profit was $5.6 billion and non-GAAP operating margins were 31% in Q4. As I mentioned at the beginning, we had a number of unusual operating expenses that impacted us this quarter. We typically review our estimates accounting policies and balance sheet on an ongoing basis and make adjustments when we think and see it necessary. Normally, I wouldn\u2019t call out these, but because they totaled slightly over $300 million this quarter, I wanted to give you some sense of these adjustments, although I won\u2019t be providing a lot of detailed break-out. So first we took approximately half that amount in compensation charges resulting from a one-time payment and reclassification between SBC and bonus expense. The other half came from a review of our real estate portfolio, where we decide to take write-down on a small number of assets and also one-time payment to buy out a number of leases in a couple of markets where we face acute space pressure. Headcount was up, but just over 2,000 in Q4. In total we ended the quarter with approximately 53,600 full-time employees. You\u2019ll notice also that our effective tax rate was 16%, again another discrepancy for Q4, which was really, primarily impacted by the extension of the R&D tax credits for 2014 with the entire credit being taken in Q4. As well as continued mix shift from earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries. Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was $128 million. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging programs. For more detail on OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website. We are pleased with our strong operating cash flow at $6.4 billion. Our CapEx for the quarter was $3.6 billion. And this quarter, most of the CapEx was spent on related to facilities, production equipment, and datacenter construction in that order. So as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we have been opportunistic about acquiring space in real estate where we need to relieve pressure and accommodate for future growth. To that end, our facilities expenditure included just over $900 million of real estate investments during the quarter, of which $585 million was related to the acquisition of our property in Redwood City that we disclosed in our 10-Q for the third quarter. Our free cash flow was $2.8 billion, and I also want to note that we completed in Q4 the sale of Motorola Mobile to Lenovo in October 29. We recognize a gain on disposition of $740 million net of tax, which is included in our net income from discontinued operations. So there you have it, despite a noisy quarter from a P&L perspective. We can say that we had strong results in our core business as evidenced by our 18% fixed FX growth this quarter and are well-positioned for the year ahead in the long-term. As Larry says, although the vast majority of our resources in time continue to be invested in our core products, we also have enthusiasm to invest in new promising ideas like Self-Driving Cars or Loon. We use the same disciplined approach to these new areas that we used for investing in our earlier bets like Android or Chrome or Display. Our projects start with small dedicated teams that are given clear milestones to hit before they can get further investments. And in cases where we achieve success against our milestones, we expand our investments, and you saw this as an example earlier this week with our Fiber teams. We greenlighted 18 cities in four metropolitan areas in the U.S., out of the 34 cities and 9 metros that we had reviewed in 2014, and they\u2019re off to the races. In other cases, when the teams aren\u2019t able to hit hurdles, but we think there are still a lot of promise. We might ask them to take a pause and take the time to reset their strategies, as we recently did in the case of Glass. And in those situations our project don\u2019t have the impact we had hoped for, we do take the tough calls. We make the decision to cancel them and you\u2019ve seen us do this time and time again. So before I turn it over to Omid, I\u2019d like also to note that in many ways 2014 was a year of significant investment growth, both in CapEx and OpEx at Google. From an investment perspective, we\u2019ll continue to seek a healthy balance between growth and discipline and the willingness to throw a little back when we reached the limits of what we believe we can manageably absorb. So with that in mind, I\u2019ll take it over to Omid now to provide more specifics on the successful performance of our core and new businesses. Omid is joining us by phone from another location today. So I hop it over to you, Omid. Omid Kordestani : Thanks, Patrick. Hi, everyone, happy New Year. And thanks for joining us today. This is Omid. It\u2019s my pleasure to join you from London tonight. I\u2019m glad to be here to reflect on the last quarter and look ahead to 2015. 2014 ended with healthy momentum enabling us to achieve $66 billion in revenue for the year. In Q4, we launched Lollipop, our newest version of Android, refreshed our line of Nexus devices and introduced Inbox by Gmail, a new inbox that enables users to focus on the messages that matter most to them. Meanwhile our sales teams worked diligently with our advertising partners to deliver a strong holiday season. Today, I\u2019ll do a quick walkthrough of the business highlights from Q4. First, I\u2019ll give an overview of the different sectors of our ads business, performance and brand advertising and our advertising platforms. Then I\u2019ll cover progress in our emerging non-ads businesses. Let\u2019s begin with the performance advertising. We continue to evolve the foundation of Google\u2019s advertising business to reflect a multi-screen constantly connected world. Mobile is now a behavior, not a device, and it has a variety of unique characteristics. First, let\u2019s talk about local advertising. On mobile, consumers want to know about the stores and goods near them. We launched some exciting updates last quarter. In October, we announced local availability for product listing ads and local store front, products that give customers real time information about goods that are in stock close to where they are. Major retailers like Macy\u2019s and REI took advantage of these local inventory ads during the holidays. Overall, we saw strong engagement and results from big-box retailers during the holiday season. A second priority has been the creation of new measurement tools. We recently added estimated store visits to our estimated total conversations measurement suite. Now, advertisers can see a reliable estimate of the number of times a search ad click drive the store visit. During the holidays, ULTA Beauty reported that 12% of clicks on search ads led to a store visit with significant gains in ROI from their AdWords search marketing spend. These mobile-specific metrics help advertisers measure the full impact of their mobile marketing. The third area of progress is apps. We have driven hundreds of millions of app downloads on Google Search, AdMob and YouTube. And this business continues to grow at a healthy clip. During the holiday season, Office Depot used Google Search Ads to promote their ElfYourself app that helps shoppers create videos of people re-imagined as dancing elves. By using Google Search Ads they saw a 65% conversion rate. We have recently enabled users to more seamlessly navigate between apps and the web and find what they are looking for in apps more quickly. In organic search 15% of signed-in users\u2019 searches on Android now return deep links to apps. We also offer app deep linking in search ads. Booking.com uses Google Search Ads to drive installs and reengagement via deep linking for their mobile app. Last quarter, we continued to see great traction with our established mobile advertising products as well, particularly Google Shopping. Online growth remains strong with Google Shopping traffic on mobile devices up nearly 100% compared to Q4 2013. For much of the holiday season mobile shopping clicks exceeded those on desktop as users increasingly made purchase decisions on the go. Now, I would like to turn to YouTube, where we continue to deliver great results for brand advertisers. YouTube now has more than 1 billion users. Everyday people watch hundreds of millions of hours of video on YouTube, generating billions of views. Watch time is up 50% year-over-year. We continue to invest in our YouTube Partners and Partner revenue has increased by more than 50% year-over-year. We are seeing great momentum in mobile advertising on YouTube. Mobile revenue on YouTube is up more than 100% year-over-year. TrueView, where advertisers pay only if someone watches their ad also continues to do very well. Walmart U.S.\u2019s holiday performance is one of many success stories. During the week of Black Friday, they used YouTube\u2019s TrueView format to drive a 300% week-over-week increase in views of their channel and more than 28 million views on the week. This was a 600% increase in YouTube channel views over the same week in 2013. And while we are all anticipating a certain football game in Arizona this weekend, the action has already begun for its advertisers on YouTube. Nearly 70 ads or teasers related to the big game have been posted to YouTube this year, up 55% from the same time last year. People have been - people have already watched them more than 44 million times, up 25% from last year and for more than 70 million minutes on YouTube nearly tripled the watch time compared to the same point last year. On average people watch each ad for more than a minute-and-a-half. We continue to develop the tools that make digital work for brand marketers, their agencies and premium publishers. There were two particular areas of focus from Q4 that I would like to highlight, programmatic and measurement. Let\u2019s start with programmatic. Automated ad buying has benefitted performance-driven advertisers for years. We\u2019re now extremely well positioned as brand advertising shifts to programmatic as well. We\u2019re seeing great traction overall from our advertising and agency partners. Today, all the top 10 global agencies use at least one product in our double click suite. Specific products within the double click suite have shown exceptional momentum. DoubleClick Bid Manager, our primary frontend for programmatic buying has doubled in volume over the past year. During the recent us mid-term election, programmatic represented nearly one-third of advertisers\u2019 Google ad budgets. We\u2019re seeing that video, the ultimate brand medium, is starting to move to programmatic as well. After launching in June of 2014, Google Partner Select, our premium programmatic video marketplace now has more than 50 publisher partners including Hearst Television, and Food Network, and includes brands like BMW. Next, we continue to invest in measurement tools that enable advertisers, agencies and publishers to better understand the results of their digital marketing. It starts with addressing the question of viewability. Nothing else matters if a human did not see your ad. This is the top question for the industry and at Google we are doing our part to address it. Since July, we have been rolling out viewability report across our ad platforms, so that brands will know whether their video ads on digital channels were actually seen or not. We recently extended this activity reporting to video ads. Large advertisers are finding technology like this to be very useful. For example, Kellogg\u2019s used DoubleClick Digital Marketing to buy their inventory programmatically and increased their ad viewability by 70%. Once a brand knows that their ads have been viewed they need to determine if the right people saw those ads and if they made an impact. That\u2019s where our tools to measure brand lift come in. We have run more than 6000 brand lift surveys to help determine brand recall and purchase intent. For example, Mondelez wanted to measure the effectiveness of a recent digital campaign for the launch of a gum brand. With brand lift they found a 36% lift in brand awareness versus a control group, and a 97% lift in ad recall versus a control group. Getting these types of feedback in real time is impossible with offline media. This sets digital apart. Let\u2019s move now to our emerging non-ad businesses. Google for Work had a great quarter. We started working with PwC to help them and a company they advise used Google for Work to move their businesses to the cloud. Cloud Platform continues to make good progress. We hosted our second Google Cloud Platform live event in November where we announced several new products such as Google Container Engine. Our digital content businesses are strong. I\u2019m excited about Google Play\u2019s development. Movies are now available in more than the 102 countries, music in 58, and books in 65. It\u2019s growing internationally at unprecedented speed. In December, we partnered with Sony to digitally release the interview. It has been publicly reported that the film generated over $15 million in its first weekend, and that Google Play and YouTube drove the majority of those sales. We launched YouTube music key beta a monthly music subscription service that provides ad free music, background play, and offline viewing. This will also include a subscription to Google Play Music with more than 30 million songs, expert queue rated play lists, and more. Our hardware efforts demonstrate momentum just in time for the holidays we launched the Nexus 6, Nexus 9, and Nexus Player devices. Chromecast continues to be a hit. Just last week, we saw our 1 billionth tap of the cast button. Chromecast usage per device has increased by 60% since launch due to a growing roster of new apps and features. According to NPD Retail Tracking Service, in 2014, Chromecast was the number one selling streaming media device in the U.S. Chromebooks are now available in 33 different markets and enjoying strong success in K-12 education market in the U.S. I continue to be impressed by the work of our marketing teams that they\u2019ve done around the world. The Year in Search has become an instant classic and YouTube Rewind is fast becoming one. From the Android Be Together Not the Same Campaign to Nest\u2019s first TV ads and much more our marketing team contributed to our success in the all-important Q4 to a wide variety of efforts. That\u2019s the wrap for 2014, and we are excited for what lies ahead in 2015. In closing, I want to thank our great partners, customers, and users, without them, we wouldn\u2019t be successful. Thank you all so much. Now, let\u2019s get back to Patrick for Q&A. Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Omid. Before we turn to Jamie for Q&A, I was highlighted by the team here that, I actually had a slip, I said Nexus 7 instead of Nexus 6. And although the Nexus 7 is still a great device, what I really meant in my comments was to talk about the Nexus 6, which is this amazing device that we have launched with the Lollipop launch. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it to Jamie, and we\u2019ll go to Q&A. Jamie, if you can give the instructions please. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju : Okay, thanks. So Patrick or Omid, I think, it\u2019s been a few years since you talked to the Street about the run rate of your Display business. I wanted to see if you are willing to toss us a nugget here in terms of what your gross billings currently maybe, recognizing that you may be seeing growth in that revenue contribution depending on different products. And also it looks like the UK revenue saw modest bit of acceleration on an FX neutral basis, granted comps were probably modestly easier, but anything you can call out that would help there? Thanks. Patrick Pichette : Yes, sure. It\u2019s Patrick here. So on both topics, on the UK, we did see a good performance this quarter on UK versus last quarter, and as you said - mentioned, a 11% year-over-year. So the note of the UK is, the core business there is doing well. If you go back to last the deceleration, we have - it\u2019s a big portion, it\u2019s like 10% of our revenue, and we over 10%. The - you will remember that in our mix of products that are in the UK, clearly, our core products are there, but also AFS, like the network business is actually prominent in UK, as well in the U.S. less so in the rest of the world. And so that has an issue on the mix. And then also think of it as a promising item, which is, there is areas of new products, such as Play that are actually stronger international than they would be in the UK or in the U.S. So there lies some of the differences between the growth rates, but in many ways a lot of opportunities there, so that\u2019s what\u2019s going on in the UK, quite pleased with the progress there in Q4. And then on the issue of Display, we haven\u2019t updated the numbers to the Street. And so we have to continue to, kind of, give you the updates that we do, and if we actually have a chance in the future then we\u2019ll let you know when it\u2019s time to do so. So thanks for your questions, Steven. And we\u2019ll go to the next question, please. Jamie? Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein. Carlos Kirjner : Hi, thank you. Two questions, if I may, Patrick. You hired 2,000 people this quarter versus 1,700 in the same quarter last year, which is a 22% increase. But Google management talks a lot about the opportunity in front of the business. If that\u2019s the case, why aren\u2019t you hiring more people and spending more in R&D. Can you tell us what are the specific constraints that you guys have or imposed on yourselves that prevent you from hiring 3,000 people this quarter instead of 2,000? That\u2019s the first one. The second is the following, a few quarters ago, I seem to recall you saying that, you did not manage the business for margins, but you managed it for profit growth. Yet your operating income is down year-on-year and even if you are, the $200 million is growing very slowly. You could see how investors would look at that and say, well, how do you reconcile these things? How do you think investors should think about this trajectory of operating income growth? Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Okay. So let\u2019s take them in - each in step. On the issue of hiring, you will notice that relative to last quarter also, which is our third quarter is typically a big quarter, because we get the influx of the hires we do at colleges and otherwise. We actually decelerated from the third quarter as well. What we are managing for is, we just have a very high bar for hiring, if you can pass the bar, then we hire you. We also have capacity constraints on leadership, because there is a natural kind of number that you can kind of absorb within the culture of Google, it\u2019s really important not to lose that culture and to have a velocity, to have traction. So there is no sense bringing 5,000 people that we couldn\u2019t kind of bring into the teams and really make them perform it. So what we manage on the hiring is, we have our plans, and so we have a rate of targets of hires per each of the pals and the areas of the company. And then from there, the next hurdle is really about, can we find these people? And then finally, just making sure that we keep this kind of balance of bringing at a reasonable rate, so that we can actually absorb them in the company without losing the velocity and the culture of the place. So it\u2019s actually a pretty complex puzzle, but we are managing it, it\u2019s never perfect, but we are managing it, to the best we can. So that\u2019s the first question. On the issue of margins, look, we have different, if you think of the businesses in Google, we are looking for growth, we are looking for growth in revenue, we are looking for growth in operating profits absolute dollars, and we are looking for great returns on investment. That\u2019s the puzzle we solve for. So you have an advertising business that may have higher margins, lower capital intensity, than say, another business, which maybe Play, which has much lower margins, great prospect for growth with very large pools of revenue and margins available and we go after them for sure. You have Fiber right, and in the access, which is a completely different kind of capital intensity. But, again, the question is, does it promise, or does it have a case for large dollars operating profit delivery and high revenue and then a decent return on capital, that\u2019s how we manage it. And to kind of say, okay, well, we have what we have today, but if Play could grow at, just to take the case, ten times faster than it is doing right now, right, it would impact margin, because on the weighted average basis, it would drag it down, but we love it. We love to be able to grow Play ten times faster than we are today. So that\u2019s how we think of the puzzle. We manage them each individually for their potential, their returns, we all look for these big margin pools and these big revenue pools, and then we just allocate our capital to make sure that it\u2019s balanced across these initiatives for maximum velocity. That\u2019s the way we think about it, Carlos. Carlos Kirjner : Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Thank you very much for your question. Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question, please. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Anthony DiClemente : Thanks a lot for the question. I have two. Patrick, given the importance of Google stock price as a motivator for existing employees, for recruitment of new employees. I think, many investors out there wonder if we are getting closer to a point where it might be a wise use of resources to return capital to shareholders. Other large tech companies do it, nearly all the media companies do, at what point would you and at what point would the board of Google consider capital returns? And then second question is, I\u2019m just wondering on the switch of the default browser on Mozilla from Google to Yahoo! in the quarter, and going forward is there any way you can quantify the impact of that? And the investors also wondering, is it possible that could happen for your Safari agreement with Apple? Thanks a lot. Patrick Pichette : So, why don\u2019t I take the last question first and then the first question. The last question is, you\u2019ve all heard the announcements about Mozilla. And so when we don\u2019t comment on the details of any of our partnerships that we have. Having said that, we continue to do two things that really matter. One is our users continue to actually go in, if they love Google, they will continue to find Google, whichever platform, whichever browser, and that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve focused on doing. And then the second piece is the way to win this in the long-term, right, it\u2019s very simple. You just make wonderful products. And when you make wonderful products that are magical people will find them. And so that\u2019s the strategy that we\u2019re using and we just don\u2019t comment on any of our - we\u2019ve never commented on any of our deals, so we want comment on Mozilla either. And then, for your first question, Anthony, I mean, again I can\u2019t - I just can reiterate the same message that I give on a regular basis, which is share price does matter. It matters to our board. It matters to all of us. We\u2019re all shareholders in the company. And we do review this issue on a regular basis. We review it again responsibly with the Audit Committee, with the board. And I just have nothing to announce today. Anthony DiClemente : Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Thank you so much for your question, Jamie. Let\u2019s go to our next question, please. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the questions. One on device mix, which, Omid, you called out. Is there any sense you can give us of whether some of the pricing per ad unit is starting to close from the device mix. So even though you\u2019re giving more volumes from mobile whether be smartphone or tablet we\u2019re starting to see any impact of pricing continues to move up versus desktop pricing you\u2019re seeing across your ad portfolio, would love any commentary around that. And then second, Patrick, you called out the FX impact in the Q4, any help you can give us on how we should be thinking about the FX impact going forward on their a gross or a net basis to the business as you see it versus spot today? Thanks. Patrick Pichette : Sure, I\u2019ll let Omid answer the first question then I\u2019ll jump on the second. Omid Kordestani : Sure. Thanks, Eric for the question. The way we look at this, as I said, we look at mobile and as a behavior today really as - versus a specific device. And people are using screen interchangeably, simultaneously throughout the day. And we really think about the user and the context rather than a particular form factor or device. And similarly in terms of the pricing model here, what we are focused on really building this ecosystem just the way desktop took a long time to develop and have the right ad formats that really took advantage that the platform had to offer. We\u2019re looking at this the same way. We are developing different kinds of formats, working with marketers on mobile, estimated store visits, app install, app re-engagement ads and cross device conversions. And we really feel good about the traction we\u2019re having and our sales team and advertiser agencies partners are working with us making rapid progress here. So unfortunate, I can disclose any specific breakdowns, but I can just say that we are very focus on all aspects of this just as we evolve to desktop we\u2019re doing the same in this world. On to you, Patrick. Patrick Pichette : Thank you. On the issue of FX, I think that the most important point to think about in Q4 is - I mean it was material. As I said, it was like on a gross basis over $600 million. You\u2019ve all seen the deterioration of the euro, the GDP, the yen, I mean it\u2019s versus the U.S. dollar. The one thing I would just note from our results in Q4, I mentioned this in the past that, our FX rates are set at Google a month in arrears. So in last week of November we would have set our FX rate for December. So interestingly, the December rates we\u2019ll set January. And you\u2019ve seen already in December a continued kind of nose dive in certain areas, especially the euro, and the yen. So, all I can say is for all the information we have right now is, that\u2019s not going away. And I think that everybody should be kind of considering it. On the flipside of that, I just want to kind of reinforce the fact that our FX hedging program continues to do exactly what it\u2019s supposed to do, which is in a low volatility environment we buy insurance. And in moments where we have such shocks like we\u2019re having right now, we did get a lot of benefit out of this hedging program and just as a remainder we hedge profits, right? We don\u2019t hedge revenue. It just happens that we book the profits to revenue, because of the accounting rules. And so we\u2019ve seen in Q4 approximately $150 million of hedge benefits, which is actually quite a substantial amount on the total $600 million and we\u2019ll continue to have hedge benefits through the course of the year to a certain extent. So I think that from that perspective, right, real hit in December additional, but in a good position from our hedge FX program. Eric Sheridan : Great. Thank you so much. Patrick Pichette : Thank you for those questions. Jamie, why don\u2019t we go to our next question, please. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Ross Sandler : Great. I had two questions. Patrick, towards the end of the prepared remarks you said that Google show a balance of growth and discipline, and a willingness to throw a little back. Can you just elaborate on that comment? What do you mean when you say that? Are you referring to the pace of expense growth or throwing something back in terms of capital allocation, just a little clarity on that one? And then, Omid, the question on app indexing, I think you guys said in November that log-in searches have about 15% coverage in terms of app content. Where is that percentage today and when do you guys think it will be closer to 100%? Thanks. Patrick Pichette : Ross, let me - it\u2019s Patrick, let me jump in on the first question then I\u2019ll let Omid answer the second. On the first one, all I wanted to highlight to our investors, shareholders and community at large is, as I said, 2014 was a year of significant investment growth. I mean, we see real potential in so many areas that are exciting to us and where we see great momentum. That - what I wanted to make sure is that, our investors continue to understand that we will push for growth, but in a disciplined manner. And if things don\u2019t materialize in the way that you don\u2019t hit your hurdles, you don\u2019t hit your timing, right, we are actually disciplined to make sure that we don\u2019t have expenses ahead of the curve and we continue to monitor it quite closely. So in that sense if we see conditions change, it\u2019s really important that you have the confidence that when we manage these investments we do it in the prudent manner, right, optimistic, but there\u2019s always a dose of circumspection to make sure that you get the best bang for your buck in these roll-outs. And that\u2019s what I really want to kind of communicate and signal to the Street, which is, it\u2019s a balance. It\u2019s always about a balance but given our situation, given all of the results that we\u2019ve had, I mean, 18% year-over-year growth, in our sites if you just look at the sites, which is the core of the business growing 18% year-over-year, despite all the FX headwinds, right? It just tells you, look, this is a license to continue to invest smartly in the way we do, but I just want to kind of reaffirm to you that we do it in smart way and a discipline manner. We\u2019re driving forward make sure we don\u2019t waste our shareholders money. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Omid to answer the first question, please. Omid Kordestani : Yes. Thanks, Ross. So as I said in my opening remarks that 15% of signed-in users\u2019 searches on Android now return deep links to app. The way we are focused on this is that we have opened up app indexing to all Android developers, so their apps can appear in searches, also linking directly to the right content in the apps. And it really becomes the job between the developers trying to understand intent and how obviously our research works and determining the best results to provide, including the deep links. We offer this deep linking and search ads as well. Booking.com use Google Search Ads to drive installs and reengagement via deep linking for their mobile approximately, and we are seeing more and more adoption like this by our advertisers. So, obviously, it\u2019s an area we are going to continue making progress on, we are very pleased to the traction we are having and how mobile monetization is performing. Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Thanks for your question, Ross. Let\u2019s go to our next question, Jamie, please. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Benjamin Swinburne : Thank you. Patrick, just going back to return of capital again, there was\u2013 there\u2019s some news today that there is a potential bill to allow repatriation of cash back to the U.S. at a 6% tax rate. I\u2019m wondering, would that impact, how you and the board would think about return of capital, or is that sort of a completely relevant separate point? And then second, for me - for either of you, any color you can share with us on your wireless ambitions, I think, both on the MVNO side and 3.5 gigahertz, there has been a lot of discussion in the press about what Google is up to, any update you can give us on that, would be great? Patrick Pichette : So, on the second question, thank you for your questions, Ben. And on the second question that you\u2019ve asked, right, there is a lot of speculation out there. And if we had to answer off every speculation on Google\u2019s part, what\u2019s going on, I mean, we just would be - my PR team would be really busy. So we just won\u2019t comment on any speculative news. On the first question, on return on capital, absolutely, I mean, we have right now a mix of, kind of, roughly 60-40 between our U.S. 40, international 60 of our cash. We have good use for our cash in both places. But if, in fact, we had a lot more flexibility about repatriating cash, that would make a big difference in the way that we think about it and or, at least, we\u2019d take it in consideration for sure in our dialogue with the board. And so it\u2019s clearly one element, that\u2019s part of the puzzle that we would take in consideration. So if there is anything you can do to get that thing through Congress, Ben, we would really love it and just let us know when that happens. Benjamin Swinburne : I will call my Congress person. Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Thank you so much. All right, Jamie, we are going to go to our next question, please. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JP Morgan. Douglas Anmuth : Thanks for taking the question. You\u2019ve had greater emphasis on e-commerce over the last few years with Google Shopping and Express. I was hoping you could give us an update on Google Wallet and how strategic that is to your business overall and kind of closing the loop payments in general. And then secondly, can you comment, Patrick, on whether there is just anything in particular in driving the gap that we saw on sites between paid click volume and CPCs beyond some of the normal mix shift issues and FX? Thanks. Patrick Pichette : So why don\u2019t I take the second question immediately, and then I\u2019ll let, Omid, answer the issue of the commerce. So on the first one, look, it\u2019s - I want to come back on the sites issue, because 25% and then the minus 8% in terms of click growth and CPSs. And I want to start with that, because that\u2019s always the case when people kind of just focus on one, they - we kind of tend to forget the big picture, which is, it\u2019s a mix of these two things that give you this revenue that\u2019s been very strong in sites this quarter, so never look at them in isolation. Having said that, as I said in my prepared remarks, the monetization metrics for sites has all the factors that I kind of usually discuss, which is geographic, device, property, the FX and all the things I talk about. So I think, it would be misguided again this quarter to pin it down to just one trend. I think people have a tendency to say, okay, well, it\u2019s mobile, or it\u2019s FX. And but I would like to point out three things specifically this quarter. As we know as I already mentioned right, FX has been a big impact this quarter. I also noted the strength of mobile performance in our sites earlier. And I remind you that, our sites line also includes YouTube, where we continue to see impressive growth, both in developed countries and emerging markets. So, there is the rest of it, there is all these pieces, but these are some of the pieces that we should take note during this quarter. Does that make sense? I will turn it over to Omid, to answer the first question on what\u2019s going on with Google Shopping et cetera? Omid Kordestani : Yes, on Shopping and commerce in general, then I\u2019ll talk on payments, really our focus is building products that turn consumers\u2019 shopping intents into actions, quickly, easily and enabling businesses to connect and retain these customers. On payments, the goal is really to remove all the friction that one encounters now in the shopping experience. And what we\u2019re really working on here is, move beyond just tap and pay and have a full functional payment system. Today, users can send to money to friends through Gmail using their wallet app and also just made this functionality available in the UK. Loyalty, gift cards can be stored on the Wallet app to buy with Google button makes it possible for users to purchase with two clicks. So we really are focused on building a rich offering here to make it easier to shop and pay and remove the friction. Thank you, Doug. Patrick Pichette : Thank you so much for you question, Doug. Douglas Anmuth : Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question, please. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : All right. Thank you. I don\u2019t know if you can help us at all, but just kind of overview of core search growth at all, if you can, in some of your mature markets anyway to breakdown that at all? And then as you think about the search improvements you\u2019ve made, just a little high level overview, obviously, big changes with PLAs and enhanced campaigns over the last couple of years, didn\u2019t seem like, there was a lot for this holiday, but maybe outline some of the improvements you\u2019ve made recently? And then any - how is your pipeline looking for this year? Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Omid, do you want to take that question? Omid Kordestani : Yes, I\u2019ll start and then we can add more context if you have more color you need, Justin. So in terms of product listing at PLAs, it\u2019s very successful products and we are really pleased with its performance, advertisers are very pleased with it. And we also have local inventory apps that enable merchants to show customers this information in the U.S., UK, France, Germany, Japan, and Australia, and obviously we are going to continue to expand that. As I said in my remarks, we added estimated store visits in December, and it\u2019s been one year since we launched estimated total conversions. And just to give you some anecdotes with customers, PetSmart saw 10% to 18% of clicks on search Ads led to store visits and they\u2019re now investing more in Ads to reach customers across multiple screens, Famous Footwear nationwide chain have 1,100 stores. They found that 15% to 17% of the clicks on Ads resulted in store visits, and they were able to mix up the products that they promote and there is in-store merchandising strategies by region. So it\u2019s - for us it\u2019s early to think about the impact of revenue, but we really expect these suite of products to continue to help the advertisers measure at a full value of their online spending and work with us to enhance those. In terms of specific search numbers, we don\u2019t really break that down, and provide any more data on that. Thank you for your question. Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Justin. We\u2019ll have - do we have time - couple of more questions, okay. So, Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question, please. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney : Hey, thanks. I\u2019ll echo Stephen Ju\u2019s comment earlier, I think it would be great if you broke out that nonperformance advertising at some point in the future that data point would be very helpful. The CPC trends on sites that - they kind of inflected back down after showing a positive trend. It\u2019s kind of hard to think that that\u2019s nothing, but FX, I know, you have this mix of other factors, could you just clarify that, or could you quantify what CPC sites, CPSs would have been year-over-year ex-FX? And then finally, Omid, could you just talk broadly about YouTube and you\u2019ve come back you\u2019re more engaged with the company, I think, there is bit of a change in management\u2019s approach, I think, the YouTube and how you want to position it, I know it\u2019s a broad question, but could you just talk about what you want to do differently with YouTube, going forward to the next few years? Thank you. Patrick Pichette : So on the first question, why don\u2019t I jump in and then I\u2019ll let Omid talk about Q2. Look, as I mentioned just a minute ago, if you look at the sites CPCs, we purposefully actually don\u2019t point to one item, like I think, it would be tempting to just say, okay, so it\u2019s all FX this quarter, because geography has a big impact. As I mentioned right, the different properties on our sites, YouTube has an impact as well in the sense that\u2019s it\u2019s growing and it\u2019s growing in emerging markets, as well as in its core more developed markets. I purposefully made the case that\u2019s important to note that, on the mobile side, I think, we see continued strength in mobile. And so from that perspective, it\u2019s always trying to catch-up to the desktop, which itself as always improving, but we see positive trend there. So it is the mix of all these factors and we don\u2019t give down all of the details on a quarter-by-quarter basis, because they just move all over the place. So that\u2019s the answer for that one, Mark. Sorry, that\u2019s not Mark. And then, I\u2019ll let Omid answer the question on YouTube. Omid Kordestani : Sure. So first of all, in general, just to give you sense of this, as you said, I\u2019ve come back in, I just spent a lot of time CES, here in Europe spending time with customers as well. And there is just tremendous excitement about YouTube, and over 1 billion people come to the service every month and YouTube mobile revenue is up more than 100% year-to-year. And what we\u2019re really after here is finding the click for brand, GRP brand list, other metrics, and advertisers are already running brand list studies about 6,000 of them have done this with that - already with us. And what\u2019s really unique about this service is the velocity that the creators enjoy to create and deliver content to a worldwide audience, and our investments in the service and the creators just continue to pay back for us. So I know based on my meetings, I spent a lot of time with consumer goods companies at CES with major agencies there. Everybody just wants to do more. There are a lot of success stories the way they engage with us. And for us the challenge frankly is to structure our sales organization, hire the right people to go deeper with these customers with our agencies. And so you\u2019ll just see a lot of success and emphasis from us as we go after the branding dollars. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Omid. Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Thank you so much, Mark. Jamie, we\u2019re going to take one more question, so if you can turn it on, please. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Mark May with Citi. Patrick Pichette : Mark, are you there? Operator : And if you check your mute button, sir, we cannot hear you. Mark May : Hello. Patrick Pichette : There we are. Mark May : Right, sorry about that. Two questions please. Could you tell us what your strategy is in the area of digital payments and is there way that you can leverage Android to develop differentiated product in the market. And then, secondly, sorry, if I missed this. But how should we be thinking about the strategic and the financial importance of search partnerships like, for instance, the Safari deal. And if there is anything that we should be reading into the recent changes at Mozilla, and I think before that Spotlight and Siri search as far as either Google strategy and thinking in this area or its competitiveness in these deals? Thanks. Sorry, it\u2019s a lot, but\u2026 Patrick Pichette : That\u2019s okay, Mark. No problem. So I\u2019ll take the second question, and then I\u2019ll flip it over to Omid to answer the Wallet one. So on the issue of partnerships, Google has a lot of partnerships, right, it\u2019s got - it\u2019s an anchor of our strategy, because that actually gives us distribution, distribution is good. And so we also we look for partnerships in many spaces. Partnerships have to be win-wins, and in that sense, right, we\u2019ll always look for those combinations. But also at the end of the day, there\u2019s a second piece of the strategy, which is, as I said earlier, building amazing product, because if you build the amazing products then people want to distribute you product. And so that\u2019s why, we have a meet in the whole search team that actually do this amazing job through the knowledge graph and all of the other elements of search, and no matter what the device, no matter the location, no matter the time of day. If we give you the answer as you\u2019re looking for and 10 clicks less than it was before and then even faster and better all the time, that\u2019s what wins, and that\u2019s the core of what we\u2019re focused on, and then people will find the way to get the Google. So, yes, partnerships matter. But at the core of it, you need partnership, because you have a phenomenal product. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to continue to build this amazing company. So I\u2019ll let with that Omid talk about our developments for digital payments. Omid Kordestani : Hi, Mark, I already addressed this a little earlier, but - so I\u2019ll summarize it again. But we\u2019re really after removing the friction here in all the products to improve commerce and make the experience for our users seamless here. And there\u2019s really two areas we\u2019re focused on; one is really building a full functional payment system that just is beyond tap and pay. So I mentioned that earlier using Gmail and the Wallet App to send money to friends, loyalty and gift cards and buying with Google button with a press of two clicks. So and we just - the NFC devices are available, and we are really getting closer and closer to broader merchandise option. And so you\u2019ll see us emphasizing that through the devices that we are supporting out there, as well as the payment services and commerce services that we provide. So I think, you will see a lot of progress here as we - as I said try to remove the friction here. Patrick Pichette : Thank you so much for your question, Mark. Omid, I need to thank you. I mean, you\u2019re at the other end of the world and staying late for us, I think, I just can\u2019t thank you enough for all of your support over\u2026 Omid Kordestani : It\u2019s my pleasure. We\u2019re excited about the year ahead and looking forward to future updates with this group of people. Thank you. Patrick Pichette : For all of you thank you again for your support in 2014. Welcome to 2015, and I couldn\u2019t stop without thanking again all of our partners, our users, and lastly, our employees, all Googlers around the world that make this magic happen every day, couldn\u2019t do it without you, so thank you again. And Jamie, I\u2019ll let you close the call on this. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do appreciate everyone\u2019s participation. Please have a great day.",

Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Ellen. Hello, everyone. I want to say at the outset that this quarter, Google turned a strong performance, and this despite substantial currency headwinds. As we have all seen, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen, which resulted in a gross negative currency impact on our revenues of $1.1 billion for the quarter. Even after the significant benefits of our hedging program, the net impact to our gross revenue was still $795 million. If these currency trends persist, FX headwinds would obviously continue to impact our results in 2015. So for our results now, our gross total consolidated revenue was $17.3 billion, growing 12% year-over-year and declining 5% quarter over quarter. Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth is in fact a healthy 17% year-over-year. Despite significant FX pressure, Google site revenue was up a healthy 14% year-over-year to $11.9 billion and was down 4% quarter-over-quarter. Once again, strength in mobile search was the key driver of growth here. Network revenue was up 1% year-over-year at $3.6 billion and down 8% quarter-over-quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, our network businesses includes two businesses with two different growth profiles : our legacy AdSense business and our newer display and programmatic business where the latter continues to perform quite well. This quarter, we reclassified some revenues, primarily related to double-click ad serving software from the other revenue to network revenue line. This reclassification increased network revenue by approximately $130 million in Q1 and decreased other revenue by about the same amount, or the same amount. The display and programmatic business, as I mentioned earlier, continued as always to be reflected in the network line. To see the impact of this re-class on historical periods, please see the earning's slides on our IR website. Finally, Google's other revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $1.8 billion and was down 2% quarter-over-quarter. It was driven really by year-over-year growth by the Play Store, offset by declines at Nexus and what I have mentioned the FX impact. Our global aggregate paid clicks were up 13% year-over-year, down 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate CPCs were down 7% year-over-year and down 5% quarter-over-quarter. And on our monetization by property, Google sites paid clicks were up 25% year-over-year, down 3% quarter-over- quarter. Google sites CBCs were down 13% year-over-year and down 3% quarter-over-quarter. Network paid clicks were down 12% year-over-year and up 4% quarter-over-quarter, and network CPCs were up 2% year-over-year and down 11% quarter-over-quarter. As you know, we don't usually break down the impact of the individual factors on the quarterly changes in our clicks and CPCs. But this quarter, I want to provide more color on what's happening within our sites, clicks, and CPC metrics so that you can better understand the dynamics of the underlying businesses that drive them. So many commentators are incorrectly assuming that the growth trends in our sites, clicks, and CPCs are primarily due to difficulties monetizing search on Mobile, but that's in fact not the case. Remember that sites metrics includes clicks and revenues related to ads served and Google's and on properties, most notably, obviously, Google.com, but as well as YouTube, engagement ads like TrueView, where users choice not to skip an ad is counted as a click. While over the past year, we have seen YouTube viewership claimed dramatically both in established markets but also due to rapid expansion in emerging markets, and quality improvements in the TrueView ads mean that more users are in fact choosing not to skip them, increasing the overall ad view. So this means that there is much higher volume of TrueView ads being seen, which has been a significant driver of year-over-year growth in numbers that you have seen in site's clicks. True view ads currently monetize at lower rates than ad clicks on Google.com, but as you know, video ads generally reach people earlier in the purchase funnel and so across the industry, they tend to have a very different pricing profile than they would have on a typical performance search ad. Excluding the impact of YouTube TrueView ads, growth in site clicks would be lower, but still positive, and our CPCs would be healthy and growing year-over-year. So really, we have two positive stories to tell here today. First, as I mentioned earlier, we're experiencing real strength in mobile search, and the CPCs in core Search business is continuing to grow year-over-year, so it's doing very well. Second, viewership in YouTube videos and TrueView ads are growing significantly and YouTube's contribution to our advertising revenue continues to grow at a strong rate year-over-year. And we're really pleased with how the YouTube business is progressing. So that's the story. Turning to geographic performance, you'll see in our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of the world, and show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations. So despite large currency headwinds, as I mentioned, we saw solid performance for our core Advertising business all around the world. The U.S. was up 11% year-over-year to $7.4 billion. The U.K. was up 6% year-over-year to $1.7 billion. And in fixed FX terms, the U.K. actually grew 12% year-over-year. Our non-U.S. revenue, which excluding the U.K., was up 14% year-over-year to $8.2 billion, accounting for 47% of our total revenue. And in fixed FX terms, the rest of the world grew a solid 24% year-over-year. Now let me turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion for the quarter, or 22% of total advertising revenue. Our non-GAAP other costs of revenue was $2.9 billion in Q1, which excludes SBC. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $5.4 billion, again excluding stock-based compensation. As a result, our non-GAAP operating profit was a healthy $5.7 billion, and non-GAAP operating margins, 33% in Q1. Headcount was up just over 1,800 people in Q1. In total, we ended the quarter with approximately 55,400 full-time employees at Google. Our effective tax rate was 22% for Q1. Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was $157 million. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging programs. For more details on OI&E, please do refer to the slides that accompany this call on the IR website. We're pleased with our strong operating cash flow at $6.6 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $2.9 billion. This quarter, most CapEx spend was related to first product, production equipment, data center construction and facilities, in that order. Clearly, our computing capacity is a strategic asset for us and that's why we're investing in it. But we innovate there, just like we do everywhere else. To give you an example, compared to five years ago, we can now deliver more than three times as much compute power for the same amount of power or money. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $3.7 billion. So once again, strong results in the core business as evidenced by our 17% fixed FX revenue growth this quarter, and solid margin. Now I would like to turn it to Omid to provide you more specifics on our successful performance of our core and new businesses, and then we'll turn it over to questions. Omid? Omid Kordestani : Thank you, Patrick. Our teams turned in a great performance across our business this quarter. I thought I would switch up our typical format a bit this time around. So I'll quickly share some highlights, and then I want to talk more about growth areas that we are really focused on, mobile and branding. Let's start with the rise of programmatic ad buying. It's an extraordinary change for the ads industry, and I want to point out that our investments in the DoubleClick platform continue to be a big positive for us. We recently made TrueView our skippable ad formats on YouTube, available through our DoubleClick suite, and we brought Internet-delivered TV content to our Ad Exchange through M Dialogue, a company we acquired last year. Google Play is also growing fast, connecting developers and content providers with more than 1 billion people on Android devices around the world. Developers are building thriving businesses in our platform, and in February, we announced that over the past 12 months, we paid more than $7 billion to developers. We're honored to be partnering with them. Our partner hardware ecosystem is also doing great. LG Watch, Urbain and Huawei Watch recently announced new Android wear devices, and Pioneer launched in-dash car units compatible with Android auto. Also, 10 top computer OEMs are now making more than 35 Chrome devices, available in 38 countries, so they're great momentum for us. Google for Work continues to grow at an impressive pace, thanks to the addition of customers like G4S, one of the world's largest private-sector employers, who move 70,000 of their employees to drive for work. Working with our partners, we also recently launched android for work to accelerate the general adoption of android devices in the work place. Business is going great in these areas, and we continue to invest to capture the potential we see for growth. Now I want to talk more about the two areas were a see a lot of opportunity for us. First, the shift to mobile, and then the trend of TV budgets shifting to digital. Mobile devices are driving the huge shift in the way people consume media. You've heard about the trends many times. Here is our point of view. As we all know, consumers reach for their phones a lot, and some of these moments matter more than others, like when people are looking for answers or making a decision about what to buy or do. For example, more than eight in 10 smart phones users use their phone one to research a product decision they're about to make in a store. These moments include small things like looking for a movie review, and really big decisions like researching a new home purchase or figuring out what car you want to buy next. So people expect to get exactly what they want, when they want it. As a company built on intent and immediacy, that's good news for Google. Our job has always been to connect people with what they are looking for in the exact moment they are looking. Our ad products are a critical way we've delivered the right answers and the right moment, and it's something we do really well. It's often more valuable to know someone is shopping for a new SUV than it is to know basic demographic information about them. We have great opportunities in mobile with some of the most popular mobile apps including the Google app, YouTube, Gmail and Maps, and our great android platform. Search is also important to the mobile experience. We have re-tooled our search engine for mobile, providing direct answers enabling voice queries. It's really a delightful experience. Try opening the Google app and asking what's the plot of the Godfather movie or flip a coin. You will be pleasantly surprised. Chrome for mobile is also a popular app with more than 400 million users and, of course, a large number of people use it as a primary way to search the web. We continue to invest in proving the mobile web for both users and developers. In the recent chrome release, we made it easier for users to add their favorite sites to their phones home screens and get helpful opt-in notifications from sites they visit often. We've also been working to index apps just as effectively as we index web content. We now have 30 billion links within apps indexed. And if you're looking for information that lives within an app that you don't have, we'll now begin showing links to install the app right under the searches all page. The Google app on android can also give you up-to-date \u2013 can also keep you up-to-date by servicing information from more than 40 different apps when it's relevant, like Pandora music recommendations on your commute, or a car to request a lift when you arrive at the airport. We are also working very hard to make our products more accessible to the next billion people who are coming online. The first computing experience for these users won't see on a desktop machine or a laptop. They will be on a mobile phone from day on one. In fact, many of them will use a mobile device as their only computer. We launched android one, a new family of high quality, low-cost smart phones in Indonesia and the Philippines this quarter, making it available in a total of six emerging markets. We're also working to eliminate the barriers to access from connectivity issues. For instance, in countries like India, where a user might have a slow wireless connection, we can deliver a fast loading light version of search so they can get their answers quickly and pay less for data. And with the chrome app for android and iOS, our data compression features help reduce data usage by up to 50% while browsing the web. There's tremendous upside to these efforts, and we're in a great position. I'm also very excited about how we're helping marketers succeed in this mobile world. As I noticed earlier, we're connecting brands with the right people at the precise moment when it actually matters because of our strong, intense signals. Mobile also enables us to help drive the 90% of commerce that still takes place off-line, which is a massive opportunity that are partners are really excited about. People are searching on Google for things like near me, closest, and nearby, twice as much as they did last year. Our local inventory ads are a great way for businesses to drive purchases in stores right when people are looking for local options. We also help advertisers better measure the store visits that their digital ads drive, and we recently expanded the capabilities to advertisers in new countries. Our ads are also driving people to download apps precisely when they are looking for them. Our ad mobile ad network offers great targeting and reach and is the foundation of our app install offerings. Last month, we also introduced ad promotion video ads and extended app install ads to our mobile Google display network, which increased install volumes for early testers by an average of 28% without impacting cost for install. We also recently began testing sponsored search results within Google Play with a small set of users and developers, helping ad developers reach valuable users directly within the store. So I am very excited about the Mobile future, and marketers are, too. Our pivot to mobile has great momentum and is delivering strong benefits to users and advertisers. I also feel very excited about the trend of video content and TV budgets shifting to digital. YouTube is the world's most popular video service on all screens, with hundreds of millions of hours watched on YouTube every day. The place where 1 billion people come to watch video is a natural home for video advertising budgets. When people come to YouTube, they come the intent of watching video, so it's the perfect time to reach them with a video ad, not when they are distracted by something else. More and more, brands are seeing the value reaching audiences on YouTube two, with the number of TrueView advertisers growing by 45% in 2014. YouTube drives great results, and we can measure the impact. We have run over 6,000 brand live studies to date across some of those largest brand advertisers, and in studies we have run for Google preferred campaigns, we found that 94% of the campaigns we studied drove a significant lift an average of 80% in ad recall. That's why we're bringing it back this year and expanding it to more than 10 new markets. Google Preferred is also attracting some of the biggest TV advertisers to YouTube. More than 30 major brands that have never advertised on YouTube before signed on with Google preferred and saw such great results that they have continued to advertise with YouTube afterwards. YouTube is home to great content and engaged audiences, and we're seeing the natural shift of TV budgets. So those are some of my observations on the trends affecting our business, what I'm hearing from partners and why I'm upbeat on the opportunities ahead. You will see a lot more at our brand cast up-front in Europe next week at the AdWords performance Summit in early May and our I/O developer conference in late May. We look forward to seeing you there. Before I go, I want to thank all the Googlers worldwide for a great quarter, and I want to say a special thank you to Patrick, who has been our fearless CEO from almost seven years and who wrote one of the most heartfelt and awesome retirement notes I've ever seen. If you have read it, you'll know that he was inspired to move on after climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. I've since then traveled to Kilimanjaro for all Googlers recommending local deals near their homes. Patrick, you will be dearly missed. We wish you and your wife all the best on your new venture. Thank you. And, Ruth, if you are out there listening, we can't wait to begin working with you soon. Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Omid, and absolutely true for Ruth as well. Candace [ph], why don't you give us the instructions to turn on the Q&A? Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from line of Carlos Kirjner of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Carlos Kirjner : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. First, our research has suggested that many or maybe most mobile websites and mobile apps are still in pretty bad shape when it comes to user experience and conversion. I think one can expect these to improve over time. The question is, is an improvement in conversion rate and experiences within mobile apps, where users transact good or bad for Google? One could argue that people are going to spend more time in apps, transacting apps and not search. How should we think about that? Secondly, it's been more than two years since when we've seen the capital intensity very high. It continues to be quite high with $2.9 billion of CapEx. Is this the new normal? Is that what should we expect going forward? Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Omid, do you want to take the first one? I'll take the second one. Omid Kordestani : Sure. Thank you, Carlos, for the question. We are actually very excited about improvements of these mobile websites. And we really are happy to see where we can deliver the best answers to our users whether it be through an app or whether we find it on the web. We're working with developers, webmasters, publishers really serve their content to users in the format they feel best and we also recently introduced this install app, Install Carousel, which is evidence of that effort. So it's really about delivering the right results for the users and the less friction you have there and the more targeted you are, we'll see the benefits and monetization. On the other side, Carlos, on the CapEx side. We are far from surprised from these numbers internally. Part of our plan, we are shifting as you know, we've been building a lot of data centers over the last 18 months. And so that is actually giving us the opportunity to put in new equipment in. And we are jumping on the opportunity. Thinking through the total cost of ownership of these things and the much more higher efficiency of these new machines. Having said that, I won't kind of comment about future, but I just want to reemphasize that we are not surprised by these numbers. To us, actually, they make sense given our strategy. And they really fuel all the innovations that we have going for us. So it's an important part of our strategy. It's a strategic asset. Carlos Kirjner : Thank you. Omid Kordestani : Thanks, Carlos, for your question. Candace, let's go to our next question, please. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks, Patrick. Thanks for all the additional color on the paid clicks and the CPCs. So just so we step back a little bit because there are many of us who thought it really was driven mostly by mobile. Is there a point to your assertion that these real major shifts that we've seen over the last two or three years in CPC pressure has really largely been driven by you YouTube true views in the adoption of that? Is that kind of the point you're making? And if you would \u2013 in the past, you always listed the factors that would cause the shifts in pay clicks and CPCs. Could you just check off what the other items are, and put them in order of priority. What's moving those two wheels? Take you. Patrick Pichette : Yes, Mark. Thank you for your question. And in fact, that's why I made the comments I made today. I'm just talking about the situations as we have it now. I'm not looking back to prior years, I'm just saying what we have seen in this quarter and the last quarter. We're just seeing a real acceleration at YouTube, and that's why we thought it was important because we saw this change. From the fundamental kind of strong performance of YouTube, both in terms of its coverage and in terms of the performance, like even the TrueView ads, right? We tuned these ads to make sure that people want to watch them so that they are very effective, and when they do, then people watch a lot more of them. And so over the last quarter, over the last couple of quarters, we've seen the real takeoff and then the geographic expansion is kind of giving us a lot more coverage. So it's a real positive story for YouTube, because we see it now, we're reporting now. So it's not a view back to the last five years at all. I just wanted to kind of clarify that. So thank you for your question. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Candace? Let's go to our next question. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Douglas Anmuth : Thanks for taking the question. Omid, I was hoping you could drill down a little bit more on the mobile search changes that are taking place. Talk a little bit more about what you think the key factors are here and the key differences, and whether that impact is an actual result of actual monetization. And then, Patrick, just on the margins and costs in the quarter, non-GAAP operating margin is basically flat from a year ago, so trying to understand how much you think that was a factor of one-time items a year ago, or a change at all in terms of your view on cost discipline within the business? Thanks. Omid Kordestani : Thanks, Douglas. So with mobile phones really becoming such a primary way people search the net. Our goal is really to help people search, find the content that's not just relevant and timely but also really easy to read and interact with on these smaller devices and smaller screens. And it's important to note that this is just one of over 200 signals we use to evaluate the best results. Non-mobile friendly sites won't disappear from the mobile searches. They'll still rank high if they hold great content that the user wants. But the lack of mobile friendliness is a problem for web publishers, because that is abandon the websites and that's a real issue. So really early to speculate exactly how the monetization impact of these organic algorithm changes will be. But we always start with the user to deliver the right answer, the best answer, be it on the mobile web or the app. And that we think that ultimately that's good for publishers, advertisers and our users and the monetization success will follow. Patrick Pichette : Great. And so, Douglas, on my side, if you look at it, I mean, we're really pleased with Q1. If you look at the operating profit of the company, right? Despite from Q4 to Q1 revenue trends that are always seasonal, we delivered essentially the same $5.7 billion of non-GAAP operating profits for the quarter. So we're really focused on our sequential performance rather than what happened a year ago, and there was no real specific one-time items in this quarter. This was a pretty clean quarter. We're very happy with it. Thank you, Douglas for your question. Douglas Anmuth : Thank you. Patrick Pichette : Candice, let's go to the next question, please? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just go back to your comments on splitting YouTube out from the CPCs and paid clicks, you mentioned paid click growth would be lower excluding YouTube. Would you be willing to help us understand that growth rate \u2013 what looks like now, what it looked like a year ago? And on the CPCs, you mention the search CPCs continue to grow. Is that true even including migration into emerging markets where CPCs are lower and in the shift towards Mobile? Omid Kordestani : So we don't \u2013 look, I, what I wanted to do today's clarify the issue between YouTube and our kind of.com properties rather than to go into all of the details. You've seen in my notes of my comments that the impact of TrueView and site CPCs, site CPCs would be growing, a right, if you kind of take out the TrueView ad impact. And I've also noted that mobile search is continuing on the path of strength. So from that perspective, what I wanted to make sure of is that you get the color that if you just exclude the great growth of YouTube, but it has very different kind of fundamental dynamics, that the core of what is typically search performance both on Mobile and Desktop, the combined, is doing really good, and the CPCs would be growing if you take the effect out. So that's really what I want to make sure of, so people don't continue to hound on this issue. Is more about mobile that has terrible monetization. In fact, there's a good story there, too. Thank you for your question. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Your line is now open. Ben Schachter : First, Patrick, congratulations on a great run at Google and enjoy the future bike rides. A couple of questions. Can you talk about how you think Google Wallet needs to evolve to better compete with ApplePay and others? Are you beginning to see acquisitions in that space or will it be more organic? And then Patrick, any updated thoughts on how Google is viewing its cash balances? Are you going to return some of that cash before you leave? Thanks. Patrick Pichette : It's all \u2013 the easy answer is really for Omid, so let him take that one and then I will talk about the cash issues. Omid Kordestani : Sure. On ApplePay, again, I think it's just really great that the industry is really opening up here and that the merchants, the banks, consumers, are all starting to experience this. And our focus is really to bring this set of new APIs for payments, and call it Android Pay, and that our goal has always been to remove much of the friction that our users encounter today on everyday shopping experiences. And so we're excited about what the industry is doing here and what the user adoption is going to be kind we're working with all the partners to put all the pieces together and finally create the momentum that we are all looking forward to benefit from. Patrick Pichette : And on my side, Ben, I have no news on the cash issue. I will just reiterate what I've said many times, because I think that not only is it true, but it's important, that we do bring this issue to the attention of the audit community, the board; there are regular debates about this issue. And it's a balance between cash being the strategic asset and then the question that we ask ourselves also in our conversations and deliberations is do we have a pipeline of opportunities that would make us believe that we would actually widely invest this kind of money, and in that sense it's very clear that the debates we're having will continue, but we have no further updates for you on that issue. Ben Schachter : Good luck in the future. Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Ben. Will go to our next question, Candace. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you for the question and congratulations, Patrick. I just wanted to follow up on your YouTube comments earlier. You talked about the growth you've been seeing in particular over the last couple of quarters. I'm just wondering when you are talking to advertisers, kind of what's changed over the last year or so that you really think has caused this acceleration and kind of click volume that you are seeing, and how do you think about that gap and the potential for that gap to close over time with what you see in just traditional site CPCs, if you will? Thank you. Patrick Pichette : So I'll take the technical side of it, and then I will let kind of Omid give you more on the color of what's exciting at YouTube. Related to the question, and the answer I gave you, the comments I gave you today, it's really about if you think about it, about coverage rather than the new product, because we've done a lot of geographic expansion of YouTube, and that in itself gives you a lot more volume out there in terms of eyeballs. And then in addition to that, we've through the great work of the team and the AdWords team and the YouTube team, the monetization team, making sure that a TrueView is a more efficient product where people, basically they actually do watch the entire ad, and so they don't skip the four to five seconds. And all you need is given the scale of YouTube today, right, all you need is to have a product that people want more and it actually delivers a lot more value. So in terms of advertising total revenue. The fact that it's at the top of the funnel clearly has very different dynamics than when you have a very specific performance based ad that is tied to very specific high-margin query. But that doesn't mean that it's not incredibly useful for advertisers, because that's where they start is at the top of the funnel. So these are all the pieces of the puzzle that we have going for us. And for what's really exciting about YouTube, I will let Omid kind of give you more color comment on this. Omid Kordestani : Hi, Heather. First of all, I invite you to come to Grant Cast next week, I'll be there in New York, and you'll get a sense of the momentum in YouTube. But really the way we look at it is as usual, we first look at the users. One third of all people on the Internet are everyday watching, hundreds of millions of hours on YouTube. This is generating billions of views. And then when we look at our advertisers, they want to be there. So we're seeing a strong growth in TrueView with new advertisers. The number grew 45% in 2014. And all of the top 100 global brands have run TrueView ads over the past year. And as they are experiencing success, for example, with Google preferred, I think I shared this stat earlier, but 95% of the preferred campaigns that we studied drove a significant lift, an average of 80%. And then more than 30 brands that were new to advertising on YouTube use Google preferred, and then came back and continued to advertise with us afterwards. So just having great success. Patrick Pichette : So, Heather, it's a good story all-around. We are pretty pleased by it, obviously. Thank you for your question. Candace, we'll go to our next question, please. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the questions, and I will echo the sentiment, congrats, Patrick on the decision, and best of luck going forward. My questions is more around mobile. I appreciate all the color around the clicks and that CPC, but maybe you could talk a little bit either qualitatively or quantitatively about the way in which mobile advertising, especially search, is evolving overtime and whether some of the gaps that we used to talk about one or two years ago are starting to close in terms of monetization, whether it be dictated by screen sizes or people getting more comfortable. Or maybe some of the changes you will be making around mobile search with some of the ranking that we've seen in the Commonwealth tech this week. We\u2019d look to get some color about how you've seen mobile evolve and how you see it evolving going forward. Thanks. Patrick Pichette : Sure. Let me just give you some thoughts, and thank you for this. We are very excited about this pivotal mobile and it's really obviously a shift that started gradually and it's been very dramatic for us. So if you talked to every product manager at Google, and leader at Google, they have it at the forefront of their thoughts and how to delight the users, how to improve the experience, same thing on our advertising front. I think so one is obviously the efforts we're doing for the discovery, the search for information, be it in the apps or be it on mobile web. The other aspect of this that is really going to help us obviously with the monetization front, is the improvements in measurements. Measuring cross devices, measuring in-store sales. And as you know, the end of shopping experience becomes more powerful because users can find this information, they can find it with local products. It doesn't become just about driving leaps to online retailers, it's about driving traffic to off-line stores via mobile. And we're seeing great adoption from retailers, from Macy's, REI Sears. So what should really \u2013 the way we're going to talk about this kind and you're going to hear us talk more about this is this intent and immediacy that we're so good at, given our heritage in search. And we are just applying all of that knowledge and all of that experience we have in ads and search to improving this mobile experience and how we monetize. Thank you. Omid Kordestani : Thanks, Eric. Candace, our next question, please? Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Eisner [ph] . Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Can you hear me? Patrick Pichette : We can. How are you Anthony. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. How are you, Patrick? Congratulations, and best wishes on your next endeavors. A couple of questions. First, I want to ask about Maps and Waves. I mean, it seems to me like those are very strategic assets and businesses where Google has a competitive advantage. So can you just talk about the progress and user experiences with Maps and the opportunity going forward for the contribution to the business from those platforms? And then secondly, Patrick, given your telecom background, can you just please describe for us the strategy around Project Five that was announced this week? How does that connect back to the other Google Access initiatives like Google Fiber? And maybe just talk about the longer-term vision there. Thanks. Patrick Pichette : Great. Do you want to jump in first? Omid Kordestani : Yes, sure. This is Omid. Thank you for the question. On Maps, we absolutely agree with you \u2013 very strategic, very popular, and that there are more than 1 billion active users of the Google Map services. We've mapped the world, as you know, 200 countries and territories, including North Korea. 1 billion times the app has been downloaded on android and lots and lots of stats to go through. I think one of the things we're doing is not only to improve that experience and integrate it as much as it make sense throughout the services, and whenever users can take advantage of the signals and the proper response from Google. But the other side of this is also partnering. One of the things we're really actively doing is partnering on our Map service in native formats with as many partners out there that can take advantage of it. So it's a scenario we're really investing in, we are very excited about it and we have great traction, and we're also happy to offer it to our partners, and you will see us both in terms of Maps and Waves, you'll see it getting integrated in other popular web services out there. Patrick Pichette : Great. On my side, look, there's quite a different rationale if you think of Fiber versus Access, which is really kind of asset-based. We've just, as a reminder to some of our \u2013 you may have heard \u2013 we just announced Fiber yesterday, so it's still very early days. It's focus on innovating and conductivity and communications but in \"partnership\" with carriers in the U.S., hardware makers. And we are trying to see again from users perspective and from a service perspective with or without assets what should look like the next wave of innovation. So we've always, if you're always looking to make the web faster, cheaper, more available, and we wanted to try this new vision, this new idea of fast and easy wireless service, and then work with the ecosystem of our carriers, so that's why we have T-Mobile and Sprint as well as large carriers and manufacturers and developers to develop this kind of new product, new and innovative service. So, different in the sense that Anthony and in the case of Fiber or in the case of Loon it's really asset-based. This one is really about services and how can we use today's platforms to actually just drive for more innovation? So that's really the difference, but we're pretty excited. It will be interesting to see the take rate and it will be interesting to see how the market response is to it. But again, very much as usual, kind of focused on innovation, focused on pushing the envelope. Thanks for your question. Unidentified Analyst : Cool. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Stephen Ju : Patrick, bon voyage and best of luck with everything. So I'm trying to get some sense of the direction of costs involved in running YouTube? Granted, there's the revenue share component, the content owners, but then there's the everyday operating costs involved in just running the business like engineers, bandwidth, et cetera. So I'm wondering at this point what part of YouTube's cost base is variable and what part is fixed, because it seems like your revenue is now large enough to cover the costs to serve your users and the cost in the aggregate is probably not growing as rapidly as revenue. And additionally, even as we adjust for the reclassification, I guess, of the double-click to network, the Eleanor line decelerated a bit more than we saw, so I'm just wondering if this just due to Play indexing higher against those countries, in spite of the highest amount of FX headwinds, or did you have some sort of hardware shortage issue this quarter also? Thanks. Patrick Pichette : Okay. So let's start with the last one first, and then I'll come back to YouTube. On other revenues, what you have in there is, yes, you're right that we have the reclass, and then on the two other factors, clearly Play is going really well, but it is also hit by quite strong headwinds. So we are very pleased with the performance of Play, but given that it has not quite a large international SKU, it also kind of gets hit by headwinds of FX as well. And then on the hardware side, no shortage this quarter so no shortage issues versus fixed so that's been performing quite well. But again, when you look at year-over-year comparisons for hardware, then last year, we had the new Nexus Seven tablet that was quite popular. Are you have quite a bit of noise on comparisons year-over-year. And that's really so you have the combination of these three things are flowing through the line. So that's why you end up with that kind of performance. But what's most important is FX adjusted, we continue to be very, very pleased with the Play, the Play growth. On YouTube, I would interestingly, I mean, obviously, we don't divulge any of the details of what's fixed and was variable, and any of this. What I can tell you is we actually monitor the performance of YouTube for its profitability to make sure that it continues to grow profitably, and we basically kind of manage with Susan to reinvest at the right pace, if you will. So fueling the growth where it is showing up and keeping tight in areas where we need more efficiencies. So that's where we managed again \u2013 I've said this in the past and I will say it again \u2013 if you just want to make YouTube profitable to more users, very easy, right? You put on the brakes on growth, and then it just turns into a profitable business. We continue to work with attention where Susan has the carrot of, hey, as much profitability as I can generate, I can reinvest at a certain base, so it creates a great incentive for this growth and disciplined behavior that we have there. So we are pretty pleased by it. Thank you so much for your question, Steven. Candace? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Your line's open. Ross Sandler : Great. I just had two quick follow-ups from the last question, and then one for Nikesh. So, Patrick, on the operating margin question, so given the increased discipline you talked about last call, do you think this flat margin is sustainable in 2015 and if not, what would cause it to drop back down year-on-year? And then from the prior question, so this new Other Revenue line was up like 23% in the quarter. I think it was like 19% or 20% last quarter. So surprising that the acceleration is in there given the FX trends. Can you just talk about is that Google Play or is that hardware between those two? And then for Nikesh, there has been some talk of Google introducing custom audience products for AdWords? Is that something you're willing to talk about and how big of a targeting future like that could be in terms of improving our lives and increasing spend and search? Patrick Pichette : Okay. So, Ross, on my side, two points. One is on the issue of margin, you know we don't give guidance. So I can pronounce myself for the rest of 2015. But I think that in Q1, you see a good example of what we talked about when we had those comments in Q4, which is we drive for that right balance. That right balance of you want to fuel as much as possible responsibly, the growth of we have the areas where we want to invest, and in other areas, right, we may decide we're actually torque for efficiencies all the time. And you see that in our Q1 results. In fact, I didn't mention it, but just a note on the head count. The vast majority of head count for Q1 is in fact engineers and project managers. It's not G&A. It's not sales. It's really focused on engineering, because that's what we wanted to put the emphasis. So I'm using this is an example of even though the numbers are large in a number of areas, there is actually a lot of science applied to every one of these numbers to make sure that we continue to drive for high efficiencies as much as we can. You may have heard that in Q1, we canceled another program that we had, which was the Helpouts. So this program did not prove the promises that we had for it, and so we actually repurposed the team and shut down the entire initiative. So again, I'm just giving a signal that this is disciplined organization that looks at the facts that actually when it's not working, people can sense it, and then we have a good conversation about it, and then on the other side when we really see something kind of really going well, we want to make sure that we push hard for it. In the case of the second piece that you've asked, which was the growth in Other Revenue, I think Play is doing very well. We are very happy about that. And yes, we're having good results on the Nexus Six, but year-over-year, it wasn't as strong as it would have given the strength of the Nexus Seven last year, so that's really been the big driver. And as for Nikesh, Nikesh I heard, is on his way to India right now. He was on a plane, but I have Omid here who would be delighted to answer your question. Ross Sandler : Omid, I\u2019m sorry about that. Omid Kordestani : That's all right. No problem. Ross Sandler : We all do that. Omid Kordestani : People confuse us and Nikesh is at Soft right now. So, let's see, on these rumors about custom audiences. You know we are very much focused on completing the cycle of better targeting and measurement attribution, at all points of the funnel with our different products. We are not announcing any new products at this point, but we have a great number of targeting options interest intent location across all the services from performance to brand. And I think you will see us innovate here, and continue to innovate here. So thank you. Patrick Pichette : Thank you, Ross . And I didn't mean to pick on you. We all tripped over on occasion all the time. Easiest... Ross Sandler : Write down the cash on my notes. Sorry about that. Patrick Pichette : No worries. Candace, let's go to our next question, please. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Peter Stabler : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Patrick, thanks for all the color around the click information. It begs another question now, and given the frequency with which a lot of us misinterpret these numbers, and given the growing importance of brand advertising and the accompanying expansion of attribution and ROI modeling to measure impact beyond simple clicks. Wondering if these metrics have outlived their usefulness and weather you guys are considering a way to help us understand your success behind brand advertising going forward? Thanks very much. Patrick Pichette : Well, look, we look at this on a regular basis. I mean, we just happen to see on the YouTube side so much change in the last kind of couple of quarters that we thought it was worth mentioning. I think it's served as well, and if we ever decide to look at different ways to look at the business and want to report it that way, we will let you know. For now, we have really no difference in changes in the way that we reported. So that's the short answer, Peter. Peter Stabler : Okay. Thank you. Patrick Pichette : I think we have time for one last question. So why don't we take one last question before we close to call, Candace? Operator : Thank you. And our last question come from the line of Mark May of Citi. Your line is now open. Mark May : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. There's a few out there that consumer behavior is different on mobile versus desktop in terms of search and web usage versus apps. I'm wondering are you seeing that from your users as they shift from Desktop to mobile devices? I guess in that sense, is the growth in Mobile search activity offsetting the weakness that you may be seeing in desktop search? And then second question is just on verticals, by advertiser verticals. We had heard some data points during the quarter around potentially some weakness in the e-commerce category. Just wondering if you could comment a little bit on maybe some verticals where you saw a particular strength and weakness? Thanks. Patrick Pichette : Sure. Thank you, Mark, for the question. So let me just take the vertical one first in terms of performance. We definitely saw automotive and travel were stronger verticals this quarter. India was a strong performer as far as the geo goes for us. And those are really some of the areas that I could highlight. And I think in terms of this behavior change, we are really, really focused on studying it every day. I mean, the shift is very, very dramatic and that we are laser focused on being as good and relevant and fast and monetize well. All the things that we did on the desktop and continue to do on a desktop to do that on mobile. So I think all I can say on that is that your right, behaviors are different. There's an immediacy having this device always with you, using it as your assistant, using your voice to make commands and getting results, using the maps and being in a moment of purchase decision. And as we rely on this information source to help you, so all of those things are really, really powerful, and we are very excited about it. It's a journey that we're all on and looking forward to doing a better job and to monetizing well. Omid Kordestani : So thank you, Mark, for your question. Before I close, let me just kind of 10 seconds. First, Ruth will join us in about a month. We're really excited to have her. I will be here to help her in transition, but you will hear a much better voice in Q2 on the earnings call. So we're really looking forward to having her as part of the team. It, obviously, has been a delight to work at Google for the last seven years. I have kind of obviously three thanks, three huge thanks for that. First one is to the Google community, as Omid mentioned. All of these Googlers kind of are simply extraordinary individuals and people. These men and women, I mean, they just continue to develop the stream of innovation that is really changing the world and making it a better place. So it's been a real joy to work with every one of them. My colleagues, I mean around this table. The IR team, as well as the executive group that I've kind of spent many, many hours over the years, and they're mostly friends now so thank you for your friendship and all of your warmth over the last few years. And finally, you. I mean, the financial community, our shareholders. I mean, you've been kind of supportive, you've been probing, you've had the insights, you've been really with us, I mean, for the last seven years through kind of thick and thin as we've seen a lot of stuff come and go, and really a strong supporter for this a bit crazy, unconventional company. So I just need to thank you as well for all the great times together. With that, yes, I am going to grab my backpack and take off for the world. So you may see me somewhere in the world, and if you do, just please do stop and say hi. It'll be a delight to see you. So with that, I'll let Candace close the call. Thank you so much, and we'll see you or Ruth will see you in Q2. Cheers. Operator : Well, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Ellen West, Vice President-Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ma\u2019am. Ellen West : Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Google\u2019s second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Omid Kordestani. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. Please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today. Now let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovations, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.google.com. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thanks. We had strong performance in the second quarter, notwithstanding the continuation of substantial currency headwinds. Key highlights this quarter include ongoing momentum in our core search business particularly mobile, complemented by significant growth in YouTube revenues. In addition, we are increasingly benefiting from the shift towards programmatic advertising, particularly among brand advertisers. These strong top-line results were complemented by ongoing operating expense discipline in the quarter as reflected in 31% year-over-year growth in GAAP operating income and 16% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP operating income. I will first go over a summary of the quarter followed by specific financial details and conclude with things for the near-term. Omid will then cover the business and products highlights of the quarter after which we will take your questions. Beginning with the summary of our financial performance, total revenue was $17.7 billion, up an 11% year-over-year, and up 3% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues of $1.6 billion, or $1.1 billion after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 18% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. On a GAAP basis, operating profit was $4.8 billion and the operating margin was 27%. On a non-GAAP basis, that is excluding stock-based compensation, operating profit was $6 billion and the operating margin was 34%. GAAP net income was $3.9 billion, up 17% year-over-year, and up 12% versus Q1. Non-GAAP net income was $4.8 billion, up 18% year-over-year, and up 8% versus Q1. GAAP earnings per diluted share for Class A and B shares were $4.93, and for Class C were $6.43. Higher EPS for Class C reflects the impact of the adjustment payment made in Q2. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $6.99. As detailed in the earnings slides on our IR website, stock-based compensation totaled $1.1 billion, up 29% year-over-year and down 6% sequentially. Let me now turn to key elements of our financial statements. Starting with our primary revenue sources, Google sites revenue was $12.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year, and up 4% sequentially, notwithstanding currency headwinds. Year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth reflect continued strength in search, particularly mobile search. We continue to close the gap between mobile and desktop search monetization. Specifically on mobile, we\u2019re pleased with our ongoing progress resulting from our focus on user experience, ads quality and online to offline commerce initiatives. The combination of these efforts improves the effectiveness and value of mobile for users and marketers alike. Desktop search delivered solid revenue growth again this quarter. YouTube again delivered substantial growth in user engagement globally, particularly on mobile, which translated into strong adoption of our TrueView ad format. Growth in watch time on YouTube has accelerated and is now up over 60% year-over-year, the fastest growth rate we\u2019ve seen in two years. Mobile watch time has more than doubled from a year ago. Network revenue was $3.6 billion, up 2% year-on-year and up 1% sequentially, continuing to reflect the diversion performance of programatic on the one hand and our legacy network businesses on the other. Our programatic business including AdExchange and DoubleClick Bid Manager continue to deliver strong year-over-year and sequential performance then more than offset lower results in AdSense for Search. We remain committed to policy changes that improve the user experience notwithstanding the fact that these policies have a negative impact on AdSense for Search revenue. Other revenue was $1.7 billion, up 17% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Given the geographic mix of our Play business, FX also had an impact on other revenue. Year-over-year and sequential movements were driven by substantial growth in Play offset by decline in the hardware sales. Next revenues by geography. U.S. revenue was up 16% year-over-year to $8 billion and up 4% versus Q1. UK revenue was up 4% year-over-year to $1.7 billion and flat sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 11% year-over-year and was flat quarter-over-quarter, rest of world revenue was up 8% versus last year to $8 billion and up 2% versus Q1. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 22% year-over-year, and up 4% sequentially highlighting both the strength of our global business as well as the impact of FX. Finally revenue monetization; as a reminder, these metrics similarly reflect currency movements. Aggregate paid clicks grew 18% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Aggregate CPCs were down 11% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. In terms of the drivers within Google sites paid clicks were up 30% year-over-year, and up 10% sequentially in particular reflecting growth in YouTube TrueView as well as in mobile. Google sites CPCs were down 16% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. Mobile CPCs continue to strengthen and the gap to desktop continues to grow as I previously noted. The decline in CPCs reflects the impact of YouTube TrueView, which is a growing percentage of overall sites clicks mix and where CPCs remain lower than on our other platforms. Network paid clicks were down 9% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially reflecting the impact of our ongoing policy changes designed to reduce the lower quality inventory on AdSense for Search consistent with our focus on improving user experience. Network CPCs were down 3% both year-over-year and sequentially. Let me turn now to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.4 billion, or 21% of total advertising revenue, which was down slightly sequentially. Trends within sites and network TAC remains flat, due to mix shifts in partners, products and devices. As a reminder, the sites TAC line includes the TAC that we pay to search distribution partners for distributing Google Search as distinct from their own branded search. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3 billion in Q2, up 12% year-over-year, and up 7% versus Q1. Year-on-year and sequential growth were driven by costs associated with operating our data centers including deprecation as well as content acquisition cost primarily for YouTube and Play. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $5.4 billion, or 30% of revenue, up 11% year-over-year and down 1% versus Q1. The increase in operating expense versus 2Q 2014 primarily reflects R&D expense attributable to increased hiring of engineers and product managers. Headcount increased 18% versus last year and 3% versus 1Q 2015 with total headcount at quarter-end of approximately 57,100. The deceleration in year-over-year growth and decline in quarter-over-quarter operating expenses reflects in part discipline in expense management and in part lower legal expenses than in comparable periods; a breakout of individual operating expense lines is available on our earnings slides. Other income and expense was $131 million with interest income offset by higher expenses from our FX hedging program. The effective tax rate was 21% for the second quarter. As noted in our press release, in Q2, we identified an incorrect classification of certain revenues between legal entities. We revised our income tax expense for the relevant periods beginning in 2008 through the first quarter of 2015 in the cumulative amount of $711 million. The income tax adjustments were not material to the effected periods; more detail is available on our earnings slides. Turning now to CapEx and cash. CapEx for the quarter was $2.5 billion, primarily for production equipment and data center construction. CapEx spend was lower versus last year and last quarter reflecting a bit of a digestion period after an extended period of investments in both data centers and the requisite machine deployment. We continue to view our computing infrastructure as one of our most strategic assets. Operating cash flow was $7 billion with free cash flow of $4.5 billion resulting in a cash balance of approximately $70 billion at the end of the quarter of which approximately $40 billion or 58% is held overseas. Let me close with five topics of focus for the near-term, first on revenue growth and drivers. Our strong revenue growth in the second quarter, notwithstanding the adverse effects of the strong U.S. dollar evidences the health of our core search business most notably mobile, complemented by growth in YouTube and programmatic advertising. Our earlier stage products such as Fiber, Google Life Sciences, and Nest service longer-term sources of revenue. Regarding these areas, we are focused on tight governance to ensure that the resourcing for them is appropriate and we\u2019ll talk more about these products in greater detail as I get settled in. Second, the sequential deceleration in expense growth achieved in the second quarter reflects in part the benefit of expense discipline discussed in prior calls. A key focus is on the levers within our control to manage the pace of expenses while still ensuring and supporting our growth. We will do this while we continue to invest in engineering talent to keep us preeminent in innovation globally. Third, the pace of growth in capital expenditures over the last several years has been significant. Although the vast majority of CapEx to date have been to support our core business, growing requirements for newer products underscore the increasing importance of optimization across the many opportunities ahead of us. Fourth, our cash balance grew again this quarter, which of course gives us more strategic flexibility. We remain focused on judiciously capitalizing on the strategic opportunities that we have, which are many. And the key issue is how we prioritize our capital allocation, given the breadth of opportunities. Finally, as Larry has frequently noted, Google\u2019s goal is to develop great new services that significantly improves the lives of as many people as possible. Solving problems for users at scale ultimately results in monetization opportunities. How we prioritize and focus on these opportunities remains paramount, both for our employees, who remain inspired by the opportunity to work on the most cutting edge developments with maximum global impact and for our shareholders. I look forward to working with you. I will now turn the call over to Omid, who will cover the business details of the quarter. Omid Kordestani : Thanks Ruth. It\u2019s great to be here to talk with everyone again. Since we last spoke, Google has been very busy hosting our customers and developers from across the globe at events ranging from I/O to the DoubleClick Leadership Summit to BrandCast. We\u2019re seeing great momentum and results across the company. As you all saw at IO, we continue to invest in innovation across our core products. To call out just one, the new Photos app is a great example of how we\u2019re combining the power of a machine learning, search and beautiful design, something that Google is proud to bring together in such a great package for our users. Our investments in machine learning have applications across the company and have real potential to improve our business. For instance, machine learning helps us to improve and adds visual design to maximize its performance. There\u2019s enormous opportunity here. I want to quickly share a few highlights of the past quarter and then spend more time talking about our progress in what continues to be our two biggest focus areas and growth drivers : mobile and video. First, our core products continue to do well and users love them. In fact, Google Search, YouTube, Android, Chrome and Google Maps, each have over one billion users. We also continue to see great partner momentum across the Android platform. The Android phone ecosystem started with one device, one carrier and one OEM, the T-Mobile G1 in 2008 and has grown now to over 400 OEMs and over 500 carriers, who make over 4,000 distinct devices. This is a testament to our great progress on both the tech and partnering fronts. Google Play continues to grow at an impressive clip. Google Play games has added more than 180 million new users in the past six months and continues to be one of the fastest growing mobile gaming platforms in history. In addition, we\u2019re seeing strong momentum around Google Cloud platform, with a range of great new features, new major customer announcements like HTC and JDA software and our collaboration with Broad Institute. And on the advertising side as a trend towards programatic ad buying continues, we\u2019re helping clients succeed in a multi-screen world with our DoubleClick platform. We recently expanded cross device measurement to all of our DoubleClick advertiser products, so marketers can measure these conversions for all of their campaigns. And to help publishers, we\u2019ve recently announced full DoubleClick support for native ad formats. Now I\u2019ll spend a few minutes diving more into the big areas of opportunity for us, the shift to mobile and the continued growth of online video. I talked last quarter about the shift we see in consumer behavior as people turned to their phones throughout the day to decide what to buy or do. Google\u2019s role has always been to meet people\u2019s needs in the exact moment they are looking and those moments are increasingly happening on mobile devices. More Google searches now take place on mobile devices than on computers in ten countries, including the U.S. and Japan, two of our largest markets. And we know that when people search on their mobile phones, they\u2019re looking for immediacy and action. In fact, 30% of mobile queries are related to location and our efforts around local search are helping consumers to find relevant information fast. We\u2019re investing in creating great mobile experiences for people across Google products. As Sundar and his teams showed at I/O this year, there is a lot to be excited about from now on Tab to Android Pay and much more. As I mentioned, one of my favorites is the new photos app, where you can keep and organize all of your memories and easily share and save what matters to you. If you\u2019re like me and have an overwhelming number of photos on your phone, the photos app makes taking, organizing and finding pictures much more manageable and enjoyable and it\u2019s getting better every day. In addition, our teams have made great strides to help users find what they need within third-party apps through indexing. We now have 50 billion links within apps index and 25% of signed in Google searches on Android now return deep links, taking users right to content within an app or to a link so they can install it. We also recently started showing such links in search results on iOS, developers like [indiscernible] are really seeing a boost in traffic as a result of deep linking. We also added now cards for more than 100 apps like OpenTable and Spotify and we have extended Google Voice actions to third party developers, so we can say things like, okay Google listen to MPR. Alongside our efforts to make mobile better for users, we\u2019re continuing to help marketers succeed in today\u2019s mobile world. For instance at I/O we recently announced universal app campaigns, which will let developers easily reach users across Google search, the add mob network, mobile sites, YouTube and Google Play. Marketers just tell us what their ad will say, the audience they want to reach, and how much they want to spend and our ad systems will do the rest to help them maximize performance. We introduced new mobile ad formats like automobile ads, which take you directly to a carousel of vehicle images important details like estimated MPG, and links to nearby dealer listings. And just yesterday, we announced purchases on Google, which makes it easier for people searching on Google to buy things right from their mobile phones. I want to turn now to YouTube, which is showing strong momentum with users and advertisers as we reinvent the television experience for the digital age. On mobile alone, YouTube reaches more 18 to 49 year old in the U.S. than any U.S. cable network. And the number of users coming to YouTube, who start at the Youtube homepage similar to the way they might turn on their TV is up over three times year-on-year plus once users are in YouTube, they are spending more time per session watching videos, on mobile the average viewing session is now more than 40 minutes up more than 50% year-over-year. As consumers continue to shift their content consumption from television to digital, brand dollars are flowing \u2013 I am sorry following, which we\u2019re seeing an upfront buying through our Google preferred model. Compared to the same period after BrandCast as last year, Google preferred commitments in the U.S. were three times higher. We\u2019re also seeing great adoption of our video ad formats like TrueView and continue to help marketers engage and connect the consumers in new ways. The number of advertisers running video ad on YouTube is up more than 40% year-over-year and for our top 100 advertisers, the average spend per advertiser is up over 60% year-over-year. We recently introduced a new feature for TrueView that allows brands to automatically insert product information, images and pricing into their video ads. And as advertising increasingly shifts towards programatic buying brands can now easily buy TrueView ads programatically through DoubleClick Bid Manager. All this is helping our content creators build the next generation of media companies doing what they love making great videos. The number of channels earning six figures per year on YouTube is up 50% year-over-year. One of the key reasons for this success is our Content ID initiative which is used by more than 8,000 partners who have claimed over 400 million videos helping them control their content on YouTube and make money on videos containing copyrighted material. So as you can see it\u2019s been a very busy and successful quarter, we are super focus on our key goals of delivering amazing mobile and video experiences and there is lot more coming in the next few months including the Android M release, now on tap Android Pay, and YouTube gaming. Thank you to all the Googlers around the world for their great work everyday. And now back to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you. In my comments, I meant to note that the gap between mobile and desktop continues to [Technical Difficulty]. And with that I\u2019ll turn it back to Ellen. Ellen West : Great, thank you [Technical Difficulty] Unidentified Analyst : Really had build up headcount and data center capabilities. Just where are you on capacity and really what was the purpose of this big build up, what kind of capabilities does that give Google today? Thank you. Ruth Porat : Thank you for that question. First I do want to clarify one thing in my comments on CPCs, I meant to note that the gap between mobile and desktop continues to narrow obviously an important trend wanted to clarify that. So look in terms of headcount in data center capabilities and what that does for us. As I said in our view, our infrastructure is one of the most strategic assets that we have and as we talk about what happened in the second quarter it reflects the fact that there can be some variability in the cadence of spend and so while overall capital intensity was lower in Q2 than in prior year and prior quarter, that\u2019s a more an issue of how spend is faced during the year but the main point as we do computing capacity as a strategic asset it provides us with the flexibility necessary for growth. And as I try to convey as well obviously it\u2019s a priority to achieve efficiencies were possible and particular given some of the newer opportunities that we have. And so we are just beginning the 2016 budgeting process quarter that is prioritization but it really has been about strategic flexibility and the underlying strength of all that we do. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Ruth Porat : Great. Operator, we\u2019ll go to our next question, please. Operator : And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Duetsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ross Sandler : Great, I just had two questions. Omid, the U.S. reaccelerated looks like from 12% to 16% in the quarter, can you just give us a little color of what drove that was it more a function of core search and mobile picking up or \u2013 for YouTube? And then, Ruth did you mentioned in you prepared remarks that a lot of the expense deceleration was put in place before you got to Google. So now that you\u2019ve been in the seat for a couple of months, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing and what potentially you could do in addition to what was in place in 2015 before you got there? Thank you. Omid Kordestani : Thank you, Ross. Our performance really reflects the fact that we have a diverse set of products that are doing well. We have strength in core search obviously and in particularly mobile, YouTube and programmatic we\u2019re seeing a lot of strength. We saw a nice pick up in a number of verticals in Q2 coming off weather-related weakness in Q1. And this quarter we\u2019re seeing retail and travel being stronger verticals in search. As to the second part of the question, I have Ruth to address that. Ruth Porat : And so with respect to expense management obviously a lot has been done on expense discipline has been discussed on calls for a number of quarters in. And I think it\u2019s fair to say proper resource allocation stretches across OpEx and CapEx and it\u2019s about prioritizing our investments and ensuring that we\u2019re being efficient and effective with our spend. To be clear, the priority is revenue growth and we have a breadth of opportunity, but pursuing revenue growth is obviously not inconsistent with expense management. And so as I noted we\u2019re just starting the 2016 budgeting process, in my experience the best way to slow the rate of growth in expenses is to work closely with business leaders really anchored in data, so together we can identify ways to prioritize resources and really continue to extend the discipline that we\u2019ve talked about. And given my early conversations with our business leaders, I look forward to this exercise over the next couple of months and we\u2019re very engaged with it. Great, operator we\u2019ll take our next question. Ross Sandler : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Carlos Kirjner : Thank you. I have two questions. Ruth can you help us understand Google\u2019s position vis-\u00e0-vis debt. It\u2019s probably not controversial that your debt level is much below your capacity. Are there any reasons why Google would not want to raise debt, if you had to finance a large acquisition and if yes, could you help us understand what these reasons are? And secondly, how do we reconcile the strength in mobile search with the fact that distribution pack grew only 6% year-on-year? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So starting with your question about cash which \u2013 and whether we would issue debt, I think, the way I look at that is you\u2019re talking about overall efficiency of balance sheet and how are we using the balance sheet and I\u2019ve slightly broadened the question more than what you did, but at the end of the day, our focus \u2013 my focus is maximizing shareholder value over the medium to long-term and that is about how effectively are we using our balance sheet where we investing and that could theoretically be a part of that. But if you step back as I\u2019ve looked at it and the key issue is what do we need for working capital? What do we need for CapEx? What do we need for M&A? What do we need potentially for capital return? How does one think about financing the various opportunities that we have and I would say it\u2019s early days, it would be premature to be more specific than that. But given this profitability of our business we have many opportunities given the growing mix of our business, we have opportunities, I would say allocation decisions are mutually exclusive, allocation can obviously change as opportunities evolve. But as we look at it, we have a breadth of opportunities, again I think it\u2019s premature to be more specific on that at this point. Carlos Kirjner : How about the distribution TAC on growing 6% given the strength of mobile? Ruth Porat : So as it relates to distribution TAC, sites TAC dollars are up modestly year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and that\u2019s what I would really focus you on its the dollar change and obviously you know the 12%, but that\u2019s a good thing, because with those TAC dollars comes revenue. As a remainder TAC includes payments made to search distribution partners is distinct from YouTube and Play content acquisition costs, which are in other cost of revenue. So looking at this on a percentage of revenue basis, what you are seeing is the impact of YouTube revenue growth, sites revenue was up. But the associated content acquisition costs are reflected in higher other cost of revenue not in sites TAC. Carlos Kirjner : Thank you. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Stephen Ju : Okay, thanks. So, Omid big picture in the outperformance of programatic in YouTube is interesting as it seems to beg the next question as you \u2013 your current list of advertising products now seems to touch all parts of the consumer purchasing funnel. So I'm wondering where you are in uniting all of the different pieces so that you can walk into a large advertiser and lay out the data, so that the 15 second TrueView spot that they ran turn into a list in the sales of X percent. Okay, thanks. Omid Kordestani : Sure. It\u2019s a good question and in fact that\u2019s one of the areas that I really focused on after I came back and, it is a suite of products that\u2019s we are very proud of and working well for advertisers and what we like to say internally, as we like to have one Google represented to the customers so that in these conversations with them we really understand their objectives and really in the classic sense of the funnel you know we can start from the brand journey from the beginning to purchase across, search display video and then as you know we recently brought cross-device measurement to DoubleClick. So, the focus is really on all aspect of this journey online to store we\u2019re showing how mobile ads are driving actual store visits for advertisers and your Brand Lift studies we\u2019re showing brands in real-time how their ads are performing, we done over 10,000 Brand Lift studies on YouTube campaigns alone. So its we really just excited about having this full suite now and being able to have the full coverage of this customer acquisition journey from branding all the way to conclusion of a transaction. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Omid Kordestani : Thank you. Ruth Porat : Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : Great, thanks. Omid, you gave a lot of great data points on the growth in YouTube and stuff that\u2019s accelerated could you spend little bit more time on the why has YouTube seen this kind of reacceleration resurgence in growth. Do you think its part of a broader industry trend, the weakness in the upfront, offline is now coming online or is what else specifically, what specifically is YouTube doing to kind of better capture those dollars and then Ruth I know somebody ask you about that, logical follow-on question is the cash returns and share repurchases and dividends and just I know its early days but your thoughts on and your collective thoughts, Google how you think about that over the next few years when if ever it make logical sense to do that? Thank you. Omid Kordestani : I\u2019ll start and hand it to Ruth. So its \u2013 I think it\u2019s really combination of all of the strength of YouTube coming together it starts with having over a billion users nearly almost one-third of all people on the internet everyday watching hundreds of millions of hours on the services and that creates billions of views and as Ruth mentioned the growth in watch time on YouTube accelerated in this now up over 60% year-over-year the fastest we\u2019ve seen in couple of years. And I think we are doing it also much better job with our products in our sales force to not only deliver for the creators on YouTube and do a better job of helping them monetize their contents and at the same time, then highlighting that success to programs like Brandcast where advertisers, agencies see that dynamic audience and service and then with the advertising products be able to then show them the real benefits of advertising and the ways that they can measure its effectiveness. So it\u2019s really all the pieces coming together for us and obviously we have a lot of work to do and we see still a lot of opportunity to enhance the service. So, I think you will see a lot of innovation coming from us both on the service front as well as on the advertising products. Ruth Porat : Hey, Mark. As you noted, it is early days but the way I view any assessment of a return on capital for my prior answer regarding balance sheet efficiency is really in the context of maximizing stakeholder value over the medium to long-term. And with return of capital it gets into the context of, how do you prioritize and allocate cash after an appropriate reserve for working capital amongst the CapEx, M&A and then potentially that capital return. And as I said, the allocation decisions are mutually exclusive, the profitability of our business gives us many opportunities, but the main point is to date the weakest return on investment here has been in our core search business including mobile search as a result of both smart M&A and CapEx. Here M&A, we built a lot of the growth engines today, YouTube and DoubleClick are great examples. Again this underscores the power of smart targeted acquisitions. We also have a strong track record of investment in new products as you know well and the infrastructure to support explosive growth, our tech infrastructure I've already commented on is really unparalleled and we do view it as a great strategic asset and we\u2019ve invested in it substantially over many years. So trying to gauge whether or how capital returns fits in, it\u2019s premature to do that and it\u2019s really looking across these various potential uses. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Ruth. Thank you, Omid. Ruth Porat : Thanks Mark. Omid Kordestani : Thank you. Ruth Porat : Okay, operator, we will take our next question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. Omid, you mentioned retail travel is through the stronger verticals advertising front and in the recent past, you guys have made a number of announcements around products that align your interest or more closely with suppliers, people who try closing the economic loop and you might be even moving down the funnel. How do you think about the opportunities for Google to sort of move down respective finals and industries where you do you already have a fair bit of expertise? Thanks. Omid Kordestani : Sure. Thanks, Eric for the question. We\u2019re really focused on connecting retailers to consumers across screens and also reducing this friction involved in finding and purchasing products. All including local products and stores. So that entire journey and all the aspects of commerce is a great area of focus for us. And as users begin to \u2013 as they search, start their searches on mobile phones, we are continuously trying to find ways to improve their mobile shopping experience. And as shopping experiences on these smart phones become easier and we focus on improving mobile conversion for advertisers. We are seeing great benefits from that, we just announced purchases on Google, for example, the smartphone only feature of the product listing ads an example. And again all of these are really for us the building blocks to help in reduction of that friction and bring the expertise we have and that understanding the immediacy, the local nature of these searches and understanding conversion and how to kind of put it all together for users, and for advertisers and machines. Ruth Porat : Okay, operator we\u2019ll take our next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JP Morgan. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Douglas Anmuth : Great thanks. Just to follow-up a little bit on the last one, Omid can you talk more specifically about the cross-platform efforts and estimated conversions in particular and whether you\u2019re seeing that prove more of the value across the platform. And then secondly, you commented several times that the gap is tightening on pricing between mobile and desktop, can you quantify that by any chance and can you just talk about what you think drives that to tighten further, go forward? Thanks. Omid Kordestani : Sure, I\u2019ll have Ruth take that second part. On the first part on this online to offline conversion efforts, we obviously know that mobile activities are influencing offline behavior and we\u2019re very busy investing in new dynamic products that help bring mobile users to stores. We\u2019re seeing strong results from clients using our tools to bridge this digital and physical world. And great adoption of local inventory ads, which help advertisers promote their store items to nearby shoppers. So again that\u2019s how the whole cycle of usage of smartphones and the immediacy come together. And then we\u2019ve created way for advertisers to measure the impact of these ads on store visits. So just to give you a couple of examples, Target, one of our advertisers found that mobile search ads greatly influence in-store store sales and using our store visit data they found that a third of their paid search ads resulted in a user visiting a target store during 2014 holiday season. So we love to continue working with them and other advertisers to show the results and then build on that. Florida department store working with us found that 63% of their mobile influenced sales take place off-line. And so more and more we\u2019re doing these studies, we\u2019re putting the tools together for these advertisers and our partners, the merchants and finding ways for them to really quantify these benefits and just scale these programs for everyone. Ruth Porat : And then as it relates to the second part of your question there are really two good stories here given the importance of search. Mobile CPCs up and desktop CPCs not declining so the gap is narrowing. On the mobile side as Larry said before with respect to desktop it took time to fully develop the pricing model and we remain focused on building the mobile ecosystem to have the right ad formats and measurement to take advantage of all the platform ads to offer features like estimated store visits, app install, the rengagement ads, cross device conversions are all part of this strategy. And then on desktop, the business continues to grow. It remains a good contributor to overall results as we announced that the AdWords performance Summit in May ongoing developments in rich and useful ads that work across all screams including desktop, enable us to deliver the right answers for our users in the right moment in other words, ads format that accelerate time to conversion on both mobile and desktop and that\u2019s what\u2019s really narrowing this gap here. Douglas Anmuth : Great, thank you. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Anthony DiClemente : Hi, thanks a lot for taking my question. Ruth given your background, I just want to ask if you thought the regulatory backdrop for Google is in anyway analogous to the financial services industry and sort of what is your outlook for a larger player like Google in an environment of increasing regulatory pressure, particularly outside the U.S. and of course specifically for Google with the EC demanding changes to the search results, just wondering should we be concerned that that these regulatory pressures can ultimately have an impact on your business. Thanks. Ruth Porat : Let\u2019s see, the industries are different, but as it comes to our business Google operates in a very competitive environment, there are many windows on to the web, choice, competition, investment are all going up, not down and we do look forward to continuing to work constructively with the EC to address any concerns they may have and regulators generally. Anthony DiClemente : Okay, thank you very much. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Brian Nowak : I have two. The first one, Ruth, is going back to your comments on some of the earlier stage projects fiber life science that [indiscernible] focused on tight governance. Is there anyway you can kind of help us to think about OpEx or CapEx related to those projects at this point and how we should think about maintenance versus investment in OpEx and CapEx going forward? And then the second one just going back to the accelerating U.S. revenue growth, it sounds like mobile and YouTube are both doing pretty well. Can you just help us understand or are you seeing both accelerate \u2013 is U.S. search accelerating at this point or is it more so being driven by YouTube? Thanks. Ruth Porat : Sure, so let me take your first question \u2013 first part of your question first. In terms of overall kind of the framework for thinking about our businesses broadly, I think a valuable framework to use is one that Eric and Larry have referred to for many years, namely the 70/20/10, 70% resources on the core 20% on adjacent areas, one point that included Chrome and Android and they are now in the core but it would include things like cloud and then 10% in additional new exciting opportunities in really sizable markets like Viber or what we\u2019re doing with Google Life Sciences. And so in discussing this with Larry its clearest objective has been to instill within the culture this mission to drive not just important innovation associated with our core business but also to look for as he call them revolutionary ideas, big solutions that can meaningfully contribute both to making peoples life better into the next big revenue and earnings growth opportunity for Google. And my take is that Larry gives the 70/20/10 as an instructive framework he is also noted how hard is it to reach that 10% on these big new revolutionary ideas, because it\u2019s tough to get people to tackle big difficult new problems and start pursuing incremental change. So human nature sort of provides a limit on how big that final bucket would be the new opportunities and I think the other point to consider is the Google\u2019s core business continues to deliver strong growth. So to achieve 10% in the big new areas means continually trying to reach 10% of an even larger number. And the framework keeps us focused on big ambitions across the company but given the success of the core business I think its fair to say the 10% is a stretch goal for now and it\u2019s a way to think about resources which hopefully helps you fill in a bit there. And then the second part of your question if you could repeat that. Brian Nowak : Yes. We just going back to the accelerating overall U.S. revenue. Just curious about a little more color on the drivers there were, its sounds like both YouTube and mobile search are doing pretty well. Is it safe to say that U.S. search and YouTube are both accelerating or you seeing YouTube driver is proportionate how should we think about the drivers of the U.S. revenue acceleration? Ruth Porat : Well, you\u2019ve covered a lot of it, the U.S. growth really reflects the fact we have diverse set of products that are doing well, we had strengthen core search particularly mobile, we had strengthen YouTube and programatic as Omid talked about. So it\u2019s really the breadth across a number of different products that deliver the results that you are talking about, that we are talking about here today. Brian Nowak : Thanks. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Ellen West : Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you so much. I just had two quick questions. I was just wondering you talked a lot about desktop and mobile CPCs. I was wondering if you could share with us if the narrowing of the gap between the two was actually starting to accelerate. And then the other thing I wanted to ask is just thinking about the CapEx spending made that companies go through and clearly Google been on one on an accelerated spending way for the last few years, should we then suggest \u2013 get from your comments are you were in a digestion period that the digestion period could also be a multi-year trend as well, if there is any thoughts you could share there. Thank you. Ruth Porat : You know I think with respect to the first part of your question, we thought it was important to be clear that this gap is narrowing and to give you a sense of some of the mix issues within CPCs. So mobile, CPCs strengthening desktop not declining, YouTube remains lower, but we\u2019re seeing real strong growth in TrueView. And so it\u2019s just really to try in dimension that if you think about what\u2019s going on with the mix change. And then as it relates to expenses, what I was trying to convey there is that we \u2013 in the second quarter had a bit of a digestion period here on the back of the substantial investment spend that we\u2019ve had and I would say in terms of \u2013 if you kind of think about the second quarter in that context, there can be some variability in the cadences spend. And so a part of it as we\u2019re talking about the CapEx here is how spend has phased during the year, I wouldn\u2019t suggest that we\u2019re talking about \u2013 as the way you frame the question, this multi-period given the sheer scope of opportunities that we have. So as I said again with the front-ends with respect to both CapEx and OpEx, we\u2019re just beginning the 2016 budgeting process. We\u2019re very focused on prioritization, but I was trying to give you some context for what was going on in the second quarter. And then as it relates to OpEx in terms of the back half of the year, there are seasonal fluctuations that do typically impact operating expense as well. For example, headcount usually picks up in the third quarter with new grad hire starting and our marketing expense also tends to be weighted towards the second half of the year. So again I was trying to give you a sense of what\u2019s the cadence as you\u2019re thinking about the year. Heather Bellini : Great, thank you. Ruth Porat : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question please, operator. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Peck from Suntrust. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Robert Peck : I had two questions if you don\u2019t mind. The first is around possibility of working more directly with Yahoo on search and search results. Could you tell us about any progress there, work you\u2019ve done there? And then number two, Ruth, could you talk about the future possibly breaking out more information around your businesses to a point where maybe we\u2019d breakout YouTube or DoubleClick or some of these other businesses that could give investors a little more clarity on the size and growth of them? Thank you. Omid Kordestani : I\u2019ll take the first part. So Yahoo is currently testing search results and adds some number of partners including Google as one of their options. And they have options to use search services and search ads across your properties and you may see our ads. And so it\u2019s a standard agreement and many other publishers use our Web search and AdSense for search. We look forward to working with them and hopefully having a good performance for them. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of the second part of your question, I think, it\u2019s important to help our stakeholders understand how we think about key drivers of the business and how we manage the business, providing what I call a framework for understanding the momentum in the business, our investment choices, our capital allocation decision making. I\u2019m committed to being direct with you. I won\u2019t give you competitively sensitive information, but my goal is to help you understand the business as well as possible. And in my view it\u2019s our obligation to pursue activities that maximize value over the long-term and doing it in a disciplined fashion. And the point I'm really trying to drive here is I aim to create a framework that helps you understand where we\u2019re going. So you\u2019re asking what we think about breaking out any particular business, I\u2019m trying to understand how best to provide more insight into the drivers of the business and beyond what is currently provided and it\u2019s really too early to be more specific than that. Robert Peck : Thank you. Ruth Porat : Operator, we\u2019ll take our last question please. Operator : And our last question comes from Paul Vogel from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Paul Vogel : Great, thank you. Two questions on YouTube. One, there\u2019s been a lot of speculation in the past about the profitability of YouTube. So I\u2019m just sort of curious how you think about the revenue growth versus kind of the forward spend on forward demand and if YouTube in a position where it's starting to see leverage on the upside with the strong revenue growth. And then on the revenue side, in particular where you talk about how YouTube has been sort of \u2013 it\u2019s one of the things that's drag the optics of CPC down. When mobile was doing that I think the company believe that over time mobile would be additive and we\u2019re starting to see, but it took some time. How do you think about YouTube in the context of is there a point in time you think YouTube will actually be additive to sort of the optics of CPC versus where it is right now? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So I think there was three parts to that question. In terms of the revenue growth in YouTube, Omid hit a number of them, but we continue to have strong growth there and it really does reflect as he said the sheer volume of users we have over a billion users. And those users are spending more time watching and watch time growth continues to accelerate now up over 60% year-over-year, the fastest rate we\u2019ve seen in two years and we do view watch time as most valuable measure of engagement. And it does reflect the ongoing improvement in ads quality with more users also choosing to watch more TrueView ads not only do we have a huge user base that\u2019s highly engaged, but data points like the fact there are more 18 to 49 year olds on mobile YouTubes and watching cable TV today really underscores the opportunity here. And our focus is the opportunity to get larger budgets, move to YouTube. And then in terms of the profitability question, as you know we don\u2019t breakout profit by product and we view our technical infrastructure as a core strategic asset that supports products across the company, I have already said that on this call that is an important point. It is fair to say that much of the network expenses that supporting YouTube, it\u2019s a large user of capacity and our ability to serve high quality HD video on demand around the world is unparalleled. From the users\u2019 perspective, YouTube is a great example of a multi-device platform with high usage on both desktop and mobile. We have one ad team that works across our various products and when we work with the largest ad partners globally, we\u2019re selling a total package. Omid\u2019s comment on some of that, not surprisingly if you take our top advertisers, they all advertise across all our products, not necessarily the same rate, but we have a single team working with them to close the differential. We do view that as a great opportunity. And the goal, to give just a bit more color on how some of our assets and technical infrastructure and ad sales team benefit a number of our different products across the company. And then I think you slipped a third part in there on the status of \u2013 that kind of the CPC trends and YouTube TrueView pricing, so I will disclose out on that. CPC pricing on YouTube for TrueView ads, ads that users choose not to skip is lower than on CPC pricing on desktop and mobile, but YouTube TrueView ads represented a larger percentage of our overall clicks, so had a greater impact on CPCs. And this is really about the tremendous growth in YouTube views. And not \u2013 you know again, when we see the real uptake here and the extent to which users are choosing to watch more ads given our effort around ad relevance and quality, advertisers want to reach these audiences. And our focus is on the opportunity to get larger budgets move to YouTube. Paul Vogel : Okay, thank you. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Okay, and with that, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Operator : Well, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program.

Please go ahead. Ellen West : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s conference call on Google\u2019s third quarter 2015 earnings. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. Please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today. Now, let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Alphabet\u2019s future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s earnings press release. The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.google.com. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thanks, Ellen. We turned in a strong performance in the third quarter, notwithstanding continued meaningful currency headwinds. The key highlight this quarter was the substantial growth of our mobile search revenue complemented by ongoing strong contributions from YouTube and our programmatic business. I will first give you a summary of the quarter, followed by specific financial details and conclude with comments regarding our upcoming move to segment reporting. Sundar will then review the business and product highlights of the quarter, after which we will take your questions. Beginning with the summary of our financial performance, total revenue was $18.7 billion up 13% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues of $1.6 billion or $1.3 billion after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 21% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. On a GAAP basis, operating profit was $4.7 billion and the operating margin was 25%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating profit was $6.1 billion and the operating margin was 33%. GAAP operating income was up 26% versus last year and GAAP net income from continuing operations was up 36% year-over-year. As a reminder, the year-on-year increases reflect a non-cash impairment charge of $378 million in the third quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP operating income was up 15% year-over-year and non-GAAP net income was up 19% year-over-year. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $5.73; non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $7.35. As detailed in the earnings slides on our IR website, stock-based compensation totaled $1.4 billion, up 14% year-over-year and up 27% sequentially. With respect to stock-based compensation, the increase reflects the fact that our annual equity refresh grants were made in the third quarter as well as headcount growth. Headcount increased 16% versus last year and 5% versus 2Q 2015. Sequential growth reflects typical seasonality with new grad starting, the vast majority of whom are engineers and product managers. Let me now turn to key elements of our financial statements, starting with our primary revenue sources. Google sites revenue was $13.1 billion, up 16% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially, notwithstanding currency headwinds. Year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth reflect substantial strength in mobile search due to ongoing improvement in ad formats and delivery to better address how consumers use their mobile devices. YouTube revenue continues to grow at a significant rate with growth driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred. Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 4% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, continuing to reflect the significant growth of Programmatic, offset by the traditional network businesses. Other revenue was $1.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. Given the geographic mix of our Play business, FX also had an impact on other revenue. Year-over-year growth was driven by Google for Work, including cloud, as well as continued strong growth in Play. Both were offset by the absence of revenues included in 3Q 2014 from a licensing agreement and lower hardware sales, as we reached the end of life cycles for certain Chromecast and Nexus devices. Next, let me discuss revenues by geography, which will highlight the impact currency headwinds continue to have on our non-U.S. business. U.S. revenue was up 19% year-over-year to $8.8 billion and up 9% versus Q2. UK revenue was up 10% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, and up 7% sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 18% year-over-year, and 7% quarter-over-quarter. Rest of world revenue was up 7% versus last year to $8.1 billion and up 2% versus Q2. In fixed FX terms revenues were up 23% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. The acceleration in U.S. and UK growth in particular reflect the growth in mobile search. Finally, on monetization, as a reminder, these metrics similarly are affected by currency movements. Aggregate paid clicks grew 23% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Aggregate CPCs were down 11% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. In terms of the drivers, within Google Sites paid clicks were up 35% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. Google site CPCs were down 16% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. The movement in Google Sites paid clicks and CPCs primarily reflects the continued growth in YouTube TrueView. Network paid clicks were down 5% year-over-year and flat sequentially reflecting the impact of our ongoing policy changes designed to reduce lower quality inventory on AdSense for Search, consistent with our focus on improving the user experience. Network CPCs were down 4% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Let me now turn to expenses. Total traffic acquisition costs were $3.6 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, essentially flat as a percentage of revenue sequentially and down slightly year-over-year. As a reminder, the Sites\u2019 tagline includes the tag that we paid the search distribution partners for distributing Google Search as distinct from their own branded search. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.2 billion in Q3, up 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, as well as content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and Play. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $5.7 billion or 31% of revenue, up 14% year-over-year and up 7% versus Q2. The increase in operating expense versus comparable periods was primarily driven by R&D expense. A breakout of individual operating expense lines is available on our earnings slides. Other income and expense was $183 million. The effective tax rate was 19% for the third quarter. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction and facilities. Operating cash flow was $6 billion with free cash flow of $3.6 billion. Finally turning to cash, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $73 billion, of which approximately $42 billion or 58% is held overseas. As we announced today, our board has authorized us to commence a repurchase of our Class C capital stock of up to $5,099,019,513.59. This decision is consistent with our overall capital management framework and complements a disciplined capital allocation program. Our primary uses of capital will of course remain CapEx and M&A across the breadth of our businesses. So now let me conclude, starting in the fourth quarter with our move to segment reporting, we intent to provide additional detail for Google on the one hand, and all the other Alphabet businesses on the other hand. We refer to those other Alphabet businesses as Other Bets. We expect Other Bets to include among others Access and Energy, Nest, Life Sciences, our investment arms and X, which is where driverless cars and certain other incubation efforts reside. Specifically, we intend to disclose for both Google and Other Bets revenues profitability and CapEx. By doing this we expect that you will be better able to understand how we manage the businesses, including the pace and allocation of our investments. As Larry said in his CEO letter announcing Alphabet, we are focused on rigorously managing capital allocation and working denature each business is executing well. With that preface, let me turn to for key themes. First, in terms of revenues are strong revenue growth in Q3 reflects the ongoing momentum in Google with acceleration in mobile search complemented by the strength of YouTube and programmatic. The Other Bets our earlier stage businesses, which we believe have significant longer-term revenue potential. In the near-term, the focus there is on optimizing our investments. Second, with respect to profitability, we remain focused on managing expenses within our control, while investing to support the growth areas we have in Google and Other Bets. Segment reporting by definition provides greater insight into the profit dynamics within alphabet. Third as to CapEx, the vast majority to date, of course has been to support Google, where we continue to invest given our exciting opportunities globally. At the same time CapEx and Other Bets is expected to increase through next year as we continue to execute on the growth agenda there. In particular in Access and Energy, which contains our fiber business, among other efforts. Fourth, our growing cash balance remains a powerful tool giving us the flexibility to invest in the breadth of opportunities we have within Google and Other Bets as well as to selectively pursue compelling new bets. I will now turn the call over to Sundar, will go into more detail regarding our business trends and products. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Ruth. I\u2019m glad to be here with you all today to talk about the areas we are focused on now and in the future at Google. There is a real sense of energy and focus throughout the company and we\u2019re seeing momentum across our businesses. Products like Search, Android, Maps, Chrome and YouTube each have over a billion users already, and Google Play crossed that milestone this quarter as well. But what\u2019s most exciting is that we are just beginning to scratch the surface. We know that computing transforms people\u2019s lives, we\u2019ve gone from the PC revolution to the Internet revolution to the mobile revolution. And 10 years from now, everything will be different again in ways no one can predict. Our vision is for Google to remain a place of incredible creativity and innovation that uses a unique technical expertise to tackle big problems and create that future. We do this, arm-in-arm with our partners around the world. Today, I want to touch on three key areas that are important for us; first, making information accessible and useful; then how we are building computing platforms used by billions of people; and lastly, how we are driving growth in our core advertising business as well as new emerging businesses. Let\u2019s start with the first area. Google\u2019s core mission has always been to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Search continues to be at the center of this with people turning to search on mobile every day to find quick answers, in fact search traffic on mobile phones have now surpassed desktop traffic worldwide. We are also seeing strong mobile momentum in many emerging markets like India, which is a number two country for mobile search queries behind the U.S. This is the result of a laser focus on helping users quickly find the right information. People just want to be able to find the information they are looking for on mobile without having to worry about whether it lives on the mobile web or within apps. Mobile app usage as well as web usage is accelerating significantly. We have now indexed more than hundred billion deep links within third-party apps. So if you\u2019re looking for information that lives within an app will surface it as a result, and even give you an install link if you don\u2019t already have it. The teams have made great progress and 40% of search is now returned app index results in the top five results. These investments have gone well and you\u2019ll continue to see us push in this area. We also continue to improve the Google app, for instance app developers can now build conversational voice experiences that work within the Google app, so if you ask Google to play NPR, NPR will respond by asking if you want to pick up where you left off, or catch up on the latest news. It\u2019s also very important that we help to make the mobile web better and faster for users, both through our own products and by partnering with others. Working with over 30 publication and technology partners we recently announced an open source initiative called Accelerated Mobile Pages to make it easy for publishers and content creators to build superfast webpages for their content. This will help make the mobile web a better more enjoyable experience for users. I also want to point out that our investments in machine learning and artificial intelligence are a priority for us. Machine learning has long powered things like voice search, translation, and much more. And our machine learning is hard at work in mobile services like Now on Tap, which quickly assist you by providing additional useful information for whatever you\u2019re doing, right in the moment, anywhere on your phone. If you\u2019re an Android user that runs Marshmallow, try it out by long pressing the home button, when you\u2019re in the Map, it\u2019s very cool. Another example is the Google photos app, which leverages powerful machine learning technology to help people discover, organize and share their photos. It\u2019s a great product that people love. In fact, in just a few months since we launched it at Google I/O, photos is now used by over a 100 million users who have collectively uploaded more than 50 billion photos and videos. Now I want to talk about how we\u2019re building computing platforms that are used by billions of people. We\u2019ll continue to invest in large open ecosystems that we\u2019ve build with partners to reach great scale. Android is a prime example of this, and we\u2019re seeing exciting momentum on our platform. There are more than 1.4 billion 30-day active Android users around the world, and we are beginning to roll out Android Marshmallow which is our best-performing release yet. Working with partners Huawei and LG, we announce the newest devices joining our Nexus family. The Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X. They are beautiful and powerful devices that show off the latest and greatest that the android has to offer and they\u2019ve got tremendous reviews so far. We also announced the Pixel C which is the first android tablet built N2N by Google that brings together the benefits of a full-size keyboard with the portability of tablet. We\u2019re also creating platforms for newer areas of computing such as android wear, which now works with iOS as well. Android Auto, the Internet of Things platform that we unveiled at I/O Brillo, and of course Chrome. Chrome also powers Chromecast, and our recent Chromecast update gave it a refreshed look and faster performance. We also introduced Chromecast audio, which lets you stream your favorite music from your phone to any set of speakers. To date we have sold over 20 million Chromecast devices and have seen over 1.5 billion taps of the cast button since we launched. We\u2019re also seeing great momentum in our ads business. Our value proposition to market is of all sizes is simple, Google can help you show the right ads to the right people, at the right moment. As you\u2019ve heard on these calls before, we are seeing a major shift in consumer behavior to its micro-moments. These are moments of high intent when consumers are looking to find, buy or do something. They happen throughout the day most often on mobile devices. The single biggest theme throughout our advertising business is to help small businesses, large marketers, agencies and content creators to take advantage of this mobile opportunity. In search advertising is a huge amount going on. Advertisers like Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and Airbnb are turning to mobile search to capitalize on these key moments reach customers, and create engaging local experiences. We also recently made search ads in Google Play available to all developers letting app developers find new customers for their app at a great price where it matters. Many smart developers are already taking advantage of this. At Adweek, we introduced Customer Match, which lets marketers reach their existing customers with customized search ads on Google.com, as well as ads in YouTube and Gmail. Of course, these are really valuable for reaching key customers at moments of high intent on mobile devices. With the holiday season coming up, we are investing in providing great shopping experiences on mobile. We are also helping marketers understand how Search ads are driving in-store sales with products like Store Visits which uses our unique mobile location capabilities and is easy for any business to implement. Moving to YouTube, everyday people watch hundreds-of-millions of hours on YouTube. You know from the last quarterly call about the amazing momentum that YouTube has in mobile. It\u2019s largely coming from the YouTube app. The growth in mobile watch time also extends to videos featuring product reviews and information. People turn to YouTube and they want to research, buy or fix a product. For example, mobile watch time for apparel videos has doubled this year and videos about toys have also doubled. We see the same growth in advertising on the platform too. And we continue to invest in building ways for marketers to reach consumers effectively, like our recently announced shopping ads for YouTube, which lets people shop directly from a video, turning any relevant video into your digital storefront. And in programmatic video and display, the strong momentum continues. The number of advertisers using our programmatic solutions has nearly doubled in the last year-and-a-half, and now includes over 80% of adages top hundred advertisers. Additionally, both mobile and video impressions served on DoubleClick Bid Manager have grown more than 3.5X since last year. This is an area that\u2019s on fire for us right now and you\u2019ll see us to continue to invest in creating the best programmatic solutions for advertisers and agencies. Before I close, I want to touch on a few of our emerging businesses where we see enormous opportunities. First, digital content, Google Play continues to be a thriving hub for our digital content business, now with over 1 billion users. And just yesterday, I was really pleased that we announced YouTube Red, our YouTube subscription service for just $9.99 a month. It enables you to see videos on YouTube without ads, watch them offline, or keep playing videos when you lock your screen or start using another application. Additionally, our Google for Work business is seeing tremendous growth. In the third quarter, we crossed 1 million paying active customers using Google Drive at Work. Cloud is also a growing area where we see great opportunity and we are building a fantastic service that we\u2019ll keep investing in. Our momentum in the education space continues as well with more than 50 million Google apps for education users worldwide, and over 10 million teachers and students using Google Classroom since it launched a year ago. There are also 30,000 new Chromebooks activated in schools in the U.S. every school day. That\u2019s more than all other devices combined. So to wrap up, we have tremendous new opportunities in our new and existing businesses. We are really excited by the products and platforms that we are building for people everywhere in the world. And we are passionate about the transformative power of computing to improve people\u2019s lives in the years ahead. Thank you to everyone for your keen interest in our business. And thank you to all of the Googlers around the world for another great quarter. And with that, I will hand it back to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : Great. Thanks. Two questions, could you talk about the sustainability of the mobile search revenue growth that you see there? And is that just really been driven by finally the gapping up of kind of mobile search pricing versus desktop pricing or is there something else going on? And then, Ruth, I was just trying to figure out how you came up with that - your repurchase number and I\u2019ve been Googling that number a couple of times. I can see it\u2019s 26 to the E18 of the square root of that, but outside of that, how did you come up with that particular amount of share buyback? Why not more and why not less? Thanks. Ruth Porat : Thanks, Mark. So starting on the sustainability of mobile revenue growth, as I said, in my opening comments, revenue growth really reflects continued improvement in ad formats and delivery. And that\u2019s on top of what\u2019s a really strong industry-wide global growth in mobile usage as you know well. And then we regularly adjust the way we present ads. So we expanded ad space in some queries with particularly high commercial intent to display more relevant mobile friendly ads. And our view is just as we saw consumer behavior change on desktop we are seeing the same on mobile. And as Sundar said, we continue to believe we\u2019re in very early innings here. And then in terms of sizing, so this is the way we approached it. If I take you back to the capital framework that I laid out last quarter, it\u2019s defined primarily by CapEx and M&A, but also includes working capital and a buffer as well as a potential return of capital. And we remain focused on solving the biggest problems and solving them at scale and that presents sizable potential revenue opportunities. It was a key catalyst for creating Alphabet. But these opportunities also require investment. And so the focus of our team is on prioritizing these opportunities over a multiyear period. We look out, kind of as we\u2019re modeling it out a number of years. And then working with the Board we reviewed our outlook. We reviewed the opportunity set and we concluded that layering in this action at this time complements what we view as a very disciplined budgeting process, while still very importantly providing ample capacity to pursue the growth agenda. And then, applying this framework once we had come up with the size that we believe fits and consistent with the way we do things around here, we decided to come up with some fun math similar to the way we approach sizing the IPO, which sounds like you\u2019ve fit back right into what that was. We do view it as the right action at the right time. And it really is anchored in the framework. Mark Mahaney : Thanks, Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thanks, Mark. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ross Sandler : Thanks. I have one for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, so back to the mobile search question, the bear-case on Google has been the company\u2019s ability or lack thereof to port the search business model from PC over to mobile. And you called out mobile search is the key driver of acceleration in both the U.S. and UK. So can you just give us a little bit of more color around the volume trends that you are seeing between desktop and mobile as you cross that 50% threshold that you talked about last quarter. And then, Sundar, on the platform side, it seems like every few years new company crop up as the next big Android OEM. Looks like it\u2019s Huawei now. It\u2019s been other companies in the past. How do you plan on getting Android to a point where all these OEMs can build successful businesses on the back of it? And any update on when Google plans to roll out the Play Store in China would be helpful. Thank you. Ruth Porat : So starting with mobile and our outlook there, clearly, as I said, mobile search revenue was up significantly and it was an important catalyst in the quarter. But the very important thing to note, as we discussed also last quarter, is that desktop remains a solid contributor. And so we continue to have a healthy growth there. And when we look, if you step back, overall sites revenue, we\u2019re firing on all cylinders, really strong growth in mobile, desktop is healthy and continuing to grow. And then you layer on top of it YouTube and some of the color that Sundar added there. But that\u2019s really a continuation of what we talked about last quarter as well. Sundar Pichai : And on the platform side, look, we continue to see tremendous momentum overall on Android. In just over a year, we\u2019ve gone from 1 billion to 1.4 billion users. So obviously that translates into huge opportunities for OEMs and that\u2019s what we are seeing. Especially, there are whole new markets opening up, there\u2019s next billion users coming online in emerging markets. And businesses, I mean, Enterprises, a whole opportunity for OEMs as well. So I think there is a lot of room ahead. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Carlos Kirjner : Thank you. I have two questions as well, one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, in two parts, if you take a three-year view what are the three main milestones you think you need to reach to be successful as Google\u2019s CEO? And what you think would be the externally observable consequences of achieving these milestones? And Ruth, in the last call, you talked about the 70/20/10 framework. Can you help us understand what 70/20/10 applies to? Is it related to operating expenses, or expenses in cost in the P&L, CapEx, R&D, management time? And is it an explicit constraint in the budgeting process or am I trying to read too much into something that\u2019s just a concept of framework and a broad guideline? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Carlos. In terms of how I think about it, I think we are fortunate to have an incredibly broad mission statement. Organizing the world\u2019s information turns out to be something that has a lot of room ahead, we are still in the early days. Especially with mobile I think you have a computing platform that\u2019s going to reach, it\u2019s already reached half the world\u2019s population or on its way to reach the entirety of the human population in about five to 10 years. So want to stay focused on that both from information standpoint and a computing standpoint, I think of them as two sides of the same coin, and making sure we are building the right user experience for that. And so that\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on. Ruth Porat : And then on 70/20/10 it\u2019s intended to be instructive and it\u2019s intended to mirror the founders\u2019 vision and really capture how we devote our resources, which for us means, how do we apply effort. And for me, one of the many very important statements from the founders that explains this framework is when they said in the letters some years ago and repeated since, incrementalism in technology leads to irrelevance and thus innovation is critical. And so this mantra is really about pushing people to look at new areas, invest in newer areas, look for things that are adjacent the 20% and even the unrelated big bets, the 10%. It\u2019s not intended to be a specific guide to financial modeling. I think with our move to segment reporting, we look forward to giving you more information next quarter which should be helpful there, but directionally to talk about philosophically how do we think about our approach to the business. Carlos Kirjner : Thank you. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you very much. This question is for Ruth. I was just wondering given you\u2019re likely in the midst of 2016 business planning right now. Can you share with us the way in which you\u2019re approaching budgeting versus maybe how it was done last year? And are there any specifics you can share with us in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about it? Thank you. Ruth Porat : Well. I guess a couple of things, there has been a very strong foundation here on budgeting and the approach and setting an envelope, and working very closely with business leaders on what that that envelope should be, and we are in the midst of it in. As I said last quarter, but to emphasize our priority remains revenue growth and that doesn\u2019t give us a pass on a rigorous approach to expense growth, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused. So I think really what was very encouraging for me is there is a framework, a very strong approach to financial planning and analysis, and really building on that to make sure we have reasonable but tight envelope so that we can have the right conversations collectively, collaboratively with our business leaders to assess how we can look at optimizing all of our resources, and that\u2019s what it really comes down to, it\u2019s looking at how to manage the rate of growth of expenses, while still supporting our growth initiatives and we\u2019ll be going into more of that in as we go through our segment reporting in the fourth quarter. Heather Bellini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. One on YouTube, I guess could you talk some of the qualitative drivers that are really bring more advertising dollars on the YouTube. And then, I think last quarter you\u2019d mentioned top 100 advertisers spend was up 60% year-on-year on YouTube. I\u2019m wondering if you could update us on that? And the second one, on Search, sounds like mobile is accelerating, where you now in the mobile versus desktop monetization gap. And Sundar, how do you think about that long-term, you see mobile being higher, reaching equilibrium, how do you see that trending? Sundar Pichai : On the YouTube one, look I mean to shift to video is a profound medium shift, and especially in the context of mobile. And obviously users are following that you\u2019re seeing it in YouTube as well as elsewhere in mobile. And so advertisers are being increasingly conscious, they\u2019re being very, very responsive. And so we are seeing great traction there, and we\u2019ll continue to see that, they are moving more of their traditional budgets to YouTube and that\u2019s where we\u2019re getting traction. On mobile search - to me - increasingly we see - we already announced that or 50% of our searchers are on mobile. Mobile gives us very unique opportunities in terms of better understanding users and over time as we use things like machine learning, I think we can make great strides. So my long-term view on this is, it is ask compelling or in fact even better than the desktop, but it will take us time to get there, and we\u2019re going to be focused to be get that. Brian Nowak : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question, maybe a big picture question with respect to media distribution, media consumption and monetizing that you should across all the platforms that you distribute media. I\u2019m so curious about the various business models you\u2019re now putting in front of consumers, subscription versus advertising versus paper unit like on Google Play. How you think about the about the pros and cons and some of those distribution models? And do how think about the need to may be source content yourself for media distribution? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Thanks. To me, we want to stay focused on the user experience and we want to follow what users want, right. So if you take something like YouTube, we expect most users to consume, YouTube debate has been and advertising has been a strong part of providing the content for free to those users, and it\u2019s growing very, very well, but we also see a need for certain users, in certain scenarios be it music or gaming or for premium content to experience it in a different way. And we want to make sure we do that. So we don\u2019t have a prescriptive opinion on this as much as we will provide the right user experience and follow where it goes, and that applies to Google Play as well. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Justin Post : Thank you. Two things, Ruth, it really does seem like there\u2019s been a change in the management philosophy this year as far as kind of expense discipline into 2Q, also have seen the disclosures and now you get the buyback announcement. Could you talk about the change there, if there has been one, and how you think about that? And then the second thing, we were pretty focus on the cloud over here, Google. We don\u2019t have a number. It\u2019s in your other revenues, but Amazon is probably $8 billion plus run rate, Microsoft over $1.5 billion. Just wondering you can give us any thoughts on your cloud strategy and how you\u2019re thinking about using those really strong data center assets? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So I guess, there were a couple of things, on expenses and expense management and clearly a lot of the foundation here has - was laid some time ago. I think after a period of big expense buildup, there was an appreciation that we needed to manage the cadence of spend. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing and collectively we\u2019re locked arm-in-arm to make sure that there\u2019s resource prioritization. I think that\u2019s an important part of that we have an extraordinary set of opportunities, not just within Google but across the Alphabet businesses, and we need to ensure that prioritization is a key part of all that that we do. I would note that when you\u2019re looking at some of the expenses, operating expenses is an example. When we look forward to the fourth quarter, in particular given the hardware launches that we\u2019ve done here with the Nexus Chromecast and Pixel launches, a consistent with prior device launches we would expect higher sales and marketing and I realized I\u2019m getting a little more specific than your question, but I think it\u2019s very important to note that there are also certain patterns to some of these similarly with CapEx, CapEx is - it\u2019s been a bit more muted here. And I indicated last quarter that where in a bit of a digestion period. But when you look forward to 2016, we do see accelerated investment given the nature of the businesses that we\u2019re building up here. So I want to also just keep make sure, we can things and perspective. And I think, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s been an extraordinary experience joining this team, I think the with the move to Alphabet it gives us the opportunity to then provide some greater insight into the extraordinary operating performance within Google and breakouts you can see the investments that we\u2019re doing and we\u2019re working very tightly as a senior team here as we make that next step into this new environment in Alphabet. Sundar Pichai : On the cloud side, and he observed, I mean it\u2019s an exceptional opportunity, I think it just reflects is a secular shift every businesses in the world is going to run on cloud, eventually and so we viewed as an amazing opportunity. We\u2019re uniquely qualified to do so, as he pointed out we have tremendous experiences and running large scale cloud services. And it\u2019s been only in the past two years, and earnest we have been taking those assets and serving customers outside. For me, what\u2019s exciting as I look at new customer adoption, we are seeing tremendous momentum. We\u2019re very competitive in each of those situations, and we are investing a lot and playing for the long-term. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Douglas Anmuth : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Sundar, I want to ask about mobile. You talked about being greater than 50% of queries and want to ask if you have a view on whether - on when that will pass 50% of clicks. And then also your thoughts on what happens to desktop pricing in demand, as that happens how do you think about the tail on the desktop business as mobile just continues to take share? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : The interesting thing, we\u2019re seeing is, when we talk about mobile, mobile is a computing paradigm is eventually going to blend with what we think of his desktop today as well. So overall it\u2019s a shift in a computing paradigm, it\u2019s not just form factors. And so overtime we see all of this is together. What matters to us as people evolve they are computing paradigm search transitions to that world, and we are the best source to provide that information. So along that line, I expect all the metrics to follow the trend, and so we only see, all the right indicators, and so I think we are position for the long-term well, so I can\u2019t comment too much on the specifics beyond that. Douglas Anmuth : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Sena from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ken Sena : Thank you. I just have an ad format question, maybe just to follow-up on Eric\u2019s. We noticed that there was an additional ad slot added on mobile. And can you just maybe talk through the decisioning on that? And if so, is there anything we should interpret as far as the other ad formats that have been used too? Thank you. Ruth Porat : Well, big picture what we are doing is looking at ways to use the mobile screen space to be as useful as possible for users. So this quarter we had some important changes and we\u2019re always focused on innovation, and we\u2019re growing in a growing market. But as we\u2019ve said we\u2019re looking at how consumer behavior is changing and just as it did on desktop we\u2019re seeing the same on mobile and the notion of trying to make sure were being as useful as possible for users is key driver and we\u2019ll continue to innovate. Ken Sena : And maybe just this one follow-up. Can you see anything then it maybe in terms of the success with the efficiency that you\u2019re seeing in terms of text based mobile ads versus more of the other structured data ones that\u2019s around like part of glycerin [ph] or hotel price ads and so forth? Thanks. Ruth Porat : Yes. There is probably not much to add there. Ken Sena : Thank you. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Anthony DiClemente : Thanks a lot. I have two, one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar is ad blocking something that potential have an impact on the business either in the fourth quarter or longer term? And then, Ruth, in terms of M&A just wondering if the buyback might indicate that the company is becoming a bit more selective around larger acquisitions than it\u2019s been in prior periods of the company\u2019s lifecycle? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Anthony. On the ad blocker stuff, it\u2019s not a new phenomenon. I think it\u2019s important to understand that ads today fun almost all the services which people use, including products like Google Search, Google Maps many, many third-party products. For publishers, it represents the majority of the revenue and I think users are okay with the contract and we need to make sure it works well. It\u2019s also clear that that are areas where the ad experience is getting in the way, it affects performance, and so we as industry need to collectively do all that better. And so we are going to work hard to do that. And then, so we want to make sure we transition areas like the mobile web to have better ad experiences. But overall, I think we\u2019ve used to this, we\u2019ve seen this for a while overwhelmingly the model works well and we expect that to continue. Ruth Porat : And then, in terms of your M&A question, I talked about how did we think of sizing the return, I started with what\u2019s really most quarter as which is continuing to focus on the biggest problems and solving them at scale, and ensuring that we\u2019re investing in those. And as I said that\u2019s primarily to find by obviously the opportunity, but how do we support the growth that\u2019s about capital expenditure and about M&A, and those are really the anchor pillars in our capital framework. And then beyond that there is working capital and a buffer and then the potential return of capital. We talked about the fact that we have six products that have over billion users. Three of those were through acquisitions, YouTube, Android and Maps that is not lost on us, and then you layer on top of that, double-click that was also through acquisition. So we do have you viewed app and at the time, it wasn\u2019t clear, I\u2019d say everybody that those would end up being the incredibly powerful businesses, effective businesses for users that they are today. And so it remains a part of what we consider the bar is high, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t want you to read anything into it beyond, what it is it fits right within our framework, and as I said, we reviewed is the right action at the right time. Anthony DiClemente : That\u2019s it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Vogel from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Paul Vogel : Great. Thanks. Two questions, please. First, just when we think about search and deep liking. Can you just sort of quantify a little bit how important deep linking has been to either click, so ROI or improvements in CPC on mobile? And then, the second question is just as we think about the more transparency going forward in Q4. How should we think about businesses that currently are in the Other Bets line that may continue to growing. What would be considered to move something from other bets into core Google? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On the deep linking, I would view it as, we\u2019re beginning to scratch the surface in terms of how we get it information within apps. What\u2019s been exciting to us is all of the indication show that when we provide these deep links. Users respond to them the same way they\u2019ve done with links to websites and the model is working well. And second think maybe\u2026 Ruth Porat : Yes. Interesting in the way frame the question, so within other bets we have a pretty broad array of challenges, opportunities that are being tackled, as you know well from life sciences to driverless cars to what we\u2019re doing in access and energy. And those we\u2019re funding, we\u2019ve got a very rigorous disciplined approach to looking at the metrics against which they\u2019re performing and growing. But you used a term, when do they move into Google. And I wouldn\u2019t assume that, that\u2019s the plan. What we\u2019re really looking at is how do we continue to broaden the nature of issues that we\u2019re able to address. What we want with Alphabet is to be an extraordinary magnet, the best magnet for entrepreneurs, and to be an accelerant for their development. And to give them that the kind of environment where we can continue to thrive, and therefore build great businesses that generate tremendous returns as well for our stakeholders on top of solving big problems. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean, in fact, we\u2019re very much thinking they will continue to grow and be independent entity. So it is a broader view of what is Alphabet. Paul Vogel : Got it. So just to be clear, it\u2019s not about that there are sort of newer or smaller or growing. It\u2019s just they\u2019re separate business that will grow on their own, separate from the core Google. Ruth Porat : Our view is that we are seeding them and they are growing. And we\u2019re not pre-determining what ends up happening. There are big opportunities and we\u2019re excited to be in a position where we can address them in a way that is an incredible magnet for great entrepreneurs. Paul Vogel : Thank you. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Stephen Ju : Okay. Thanks. Sundar, so I think it was on a conference call about three years ago when Larry articulated a vision of a simple and consistent consumer experience from Google, and the same for your advertising customers as well. So as this is your first conference call with investors where do you think you are in that initiative today? Are you still on the same path or do you plan to take that on a different direction in your new role? And Ruth, despite the high growth of YouTube and Play presumably, are your cost of goods sold where the content cost of these two businesses live is not growing as rapidly. So will you give some color on where you might be driving the opage [ph]? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : On the first one, I think the vision that Larry articulated, it\u2019s a very compelling vision and it\u2019s still valid. To me, the way I think about it is mobile is a good forcing function in some ways. It\u2019s a good constraint for us to focus and deliver against that vision. So what I\u2019m doing is internally all our objectives are primarily focused on mobile, and how within the context of mobile we get to a better, simpler and a consistent experience for consumers and advertisers. And so, that framework is how we are thinking about it and I think we are making solid progress. Ruth Porat : And then, if you\u2019re focusing on the other cost to revenue line, the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth was driven by ongoing data center operations, including depreciation that\u2019s in there as well, as well as content acquisition costs, as you said primarily YouTube and Play. One thing to note as we look forward to the fourth quarter with the launch of Nexus, Chromecast and Pixel, it\u2019s worth noting that we do book the hardware costs in this line. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Ruth Porat : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark May from Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Mark May : Thanks. I had two questions that are kind of interrelated around mobile apps. When you talk about the strength in mobile search are you including also searches that are done on some of your mobile apps like search done on the Maps app or on the mobile YouTube app? And then, kind of somewhat related I guess is, yes, I think it is six apps that have over 1 billion users globally. But some of these you\u2019re not really monetizing today or very nascent stages. Can you talk about kind of your efforts maybe to monetize some of these large and actively used apps and maybe identify one or two where you\u2019re, I guess, it\u2019s for Sundar, where you\u2019re particularly sort of excited about the opportunities? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Mark. On the first one, or maybe you\u2019re specifically talking about the mobile search experience on Google.com or the Google app, but we are seeing the same traction within Maps or YouTube. We are seeing mobile usage dramatically grow and in that context people are searching as well. So it\u2019s across-the-board we are seeing strength. In terms of our app such of scale, and obviously we take a very long-term view. And several of those apps today already play huge roles, so for example, take Google Maps, it already plays a huge important role in making mobile search better. And so these are interrelated. YouTube is obviously a big opportunity. Google Play is one. And even things like Gmail are playing a critical role in Google for Work and how we are driving big business opportunities as well. And, by the way, because we are scaling all these apps over 1 billion users, we are building the infrastructure which is what will power our cloud platform externally as well. So in many ways these are all working for us. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian form Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Colin Sebastian : Great. Thanks. I want to ask about two areas of business mentioned on the call. One is machine learning. And it\u2019s just coming up a lot more frequently as a topic and I wonder if you could mention more specifically the vision that you have for some of the core applications and how machine learning can make them more useful. And then, just as a follow to the question on the Google Cloud, and specifically, the Infrastructure-as-a-Service layer, I wonder there if your strategy is more focused on price or if there are other ways that you can differentiate the service from the competition? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Machine learning is core transformative way by which we are rethinking everything we are doing. We\u2019ve been investing in this area for a while. We believe we are state-of-the-art here. And the progress particularly in the last two years has been pretty dramatic. And so we are - we are thoughtfully applying it across all our products, be it search, be it ads, be it YouTube and Play et cetera. And we are in early days, but you will see us in a systematic manner, think about how we can apply machine learning to all these areas. On Cloud, I think the right way to think about it over time, for a company or for a developer to build stuff on cloud, they need not just basic things like computer and storage, they need a whole set of services on top of it. We - so there is a lot in the stack. And so I think the way we will differentiate over time is because we have built large services on top of our infrastructure, we understand all the layers which you need to build great application. So you would see us increasingly provide value-added services on top of compute and storage. And that\u2019s the way I think we\u2019ll play this. Operator : Thank you. And that\u2019s all the time we have for questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Ellen West for any closing remarks. Ellen West : Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call. Thank you and have a good evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ellen West, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Ellen West : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2014 filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases. This call is also being webcast from abc.xyz/investor, where a replay of the call will be available later today. I'll now turn the call over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thanks. Revenue momentum in Q4 underscored the strength of our businesses globally, with consolidated revenue growth accelerating meaningfully versus last year. The primary driver was the increased use of mobile search by consumers, benefiting from our ongoing efforts to enhance the efficacy of mobile search as well as from the holiday season. In addition, results reflect ongoing momentum in YouTube and programmatic advertising. There were a number of unusual items in the quarter that I will address during the discussion of results. With a move to our new Alphabet structure, we conducted a detailed review of business opportunities and investment levels across Google and Other Bets. We made some important decisions to prioritize the allocation of resources and capital to maximize long-term potential within each area. We are pleased to be sharing financial results for each of Google and what we call the Other Bets and thereby provide more visibility into financial trends in each segment. In light of our move to segment reporting, I'm going to present to you in this order : first, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet; second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with key themes for the near term. Sundar will then review our business and products highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions. Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial operational performance, total revenue was $21.3 billion, up 18% year over year and up 14% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year over year of $1.3 billion, or $1 billion after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 24% year over year and 15% sequentially. Alphabet revenues by geography also highlight both the strength of our business around the globe as well as the impact the currency headwinds continue to have on our non-U.S. business. U.S. revenue was up 24% year over year to $10.3 billion and up 18% versus Q3. UK revenue was up 16% year over year to $1.9 billion and up 7% sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 20% year over year and 9% quarter over quarter. Rest of world revenue was up 12% versus last year to $9.1 billion and up 12% versus Q3. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 26% year over year and up 14% sequentially. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.9 billion in Q4, up 24% year over year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, most notably due to costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and hardware costs due to the launch of our new Nexus, Chromecast, and Pixel devices. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.6 billion or 31% of revenue, up 14% year over year and up 15% versus Q3, primarily driven by R&D expense, particularly affected by expenses resulting from project milestones in Other Bets established several years ago. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $5.4 billion, up 22% versus last year. The operating margin was 25%. Adjusting for stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP operating income was $6.8 billion, up 22% versus last year. The operating margin was 32%. With respect to stock-based compensation, it totaled $1.4 billion, up 20% year over year and flat sequentially, primarily reflecting head count, which was up 15% versus last year and 3% versus 3Q 2015. The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product managers. Other income and expense similarly included an unusual item this quarter. Specifically, other income and expense was negative $180 million, due primarily to the write-down of securities received in conjunction with the sale of a business, offsetting interest income from the investment portfolio. Finally, taxes also reflect the impact of certain one-time items in the quarter affecting the U.S. rate. Specifically, taxes reflect the resolution of a multiyear audit in the U.S. as well as the full-year impact in Q4 of the U.S. Congress making the R&D tax credit permanent. Our effective tax rate for the full year, including these one-time items, was 17%. Net income was $4.9 billion on a GAAP basis and $6 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7.06 on a GAAP basis and $8.67 on a non-GAAP basis. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $2.1 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.4 billion, with free cash flow of $4.3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash and marketable securities balance of approximately $73 billion, of which approximately $43 billion, or 59%, is held overseas. Our cash balance reflects the impact of seasonal working capital requirements and our repurchase during the quarter of approximately 2.4 million shares of Alphabet Class C stock for a total repurchase amount of $1.8 billion. Our Board of Directors recently authorized a modest increase in the size of the stock repurchase we announced last quarter. You can find the details in our earnings release of the total remaining authorization. Let me now turn for the first time to our segment financial results. In our earnings release, we are providing key financial metrics for Google on the one hand and the combined Other Bet businesses on the other hand. I will review the results for each segment with respect to revenues, operating income, and CapEx, which I will discuss. You can also find in the release details of stock-based compensation as well as depreciation, amortization, and impairments for Google and the combined Other Bets. As I go through the Google segment, I'll be providing the same level of detail we've presented in prior periods, both to best assist in comparability relative to prior periods and given the fact that Google continues to represent the overwhelming majority of our results. For Other Bets, I'll be discussing revenue, operating income, and CapEx for the full year. Detail on a quarterly basis is included in the press release. Keep in mind that Other Bets represents an aggregation of businesses, many of which operate in distinct sectors with different business models. Given their stages of development, these businesses will have idiosyncrasies with respect to the timing of revenue, expenses, and CapEx resulting from milestones, partnerships, and other factors. You can expect that results for the combined Other Bets may be uneven in the near term, so it's likely to be more instructive to look at them on an annual or rolling 12-month basis to assess their trajectory. Starting with the Google segment, which includes our Search and Ads business as well as related businesses such as Play, Hardware and Cloud and Apps, as well as our newer efforts within Google such as Machine Learning and Virtual Reality, Google revenue was $21.2 billion, up 18% year over year. This reflects the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $14.9 billion in the quarter, up 20% year over year, and up 14% sequentially, notwithstanding currency headwinds. Year-on-year growth reflects substantial strength in Mobile Search due to ongoing improvement in ad formats and delivery. As I mentioned previously, we also saw the benefits of consumers' greater use of mobile for shopping during this holiday season. YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred. Network revenue was $4.1 billion, up 7% year-on-year and up 12% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of Programmatic, offset by the traditional network businesses. Other revenue for Google was $2.1 billion, up 24% year over year and up 20% sequentially. Given the geographic mix of our Play business, FX also had an impact on Other revenue. Year-over-year performance was driven by Play as well as continued strong growth in Cloud and Apps. Finally, on monetization, as a reminder, these metrics similarly are affected by currency movements. Aggregate paid clicks grew 31% year over year and 17% sequentially. Aggregate CPCs were down 13% year over year and 5% sequentially. In terms of the drivers within Sites, paid clicks were up 40% year over year and up 22% sequentially. Site CPCs were down 16% year over year and down 8% sequentially. The movement in Google Sites paid clicks and CPCs primarily reflects the continued growth in YouTube TrueView. Network paid clicks were up 2% year over year and up 1% sequentially. Network CPCs were down 8% year over year and up 7% sequentially. Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.1 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 14% sequentially and up 12% year over year. As a reminder, the sites TAC line in our earnings release includes the TAC that we paid to search distribution partners for distributing Google Search as distinct from their own branded search. Operating income excluding SBC was $8 billion, up 28% versus last year for an operating margin of 38%. Google stock-based compensation totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 18% year over year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $6.8 billion, up 30% versus last year, and the operating margin was 32%. CapEx for the quarter was $1.8 billion, reflecting investments in data center construction, production equipment and facilities. Full-year 2015 Google revenues were $74.5 billion, operating income excluding SBC was $28 billion; operating income including the impact of SBC was $23.4 billion and CapEx was $8.8 billion. Turning to Other Bets' financials, Other Bets includes efforts such as all we are doing with Fiber, Verily, Calico, Nest, self-driving cars, and our incubation activities in X. As discussed previously with respect to Other Bets, we're focused on optimizing resources across this portfolio in the near term, with the objective of maximizing Alphabet's long-term value creation. For the full-year 2015, Other Bets revenue was $448 million, up 37% versus last year. Reported revenue for Other Bets was primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. As noted previously, the majority of efforts within the Other Bets are pre-revenue. On a full-year basis, operating loss excluding SBC was $3.1 billion. As previously noted, these results reflect the impact of project milestones established several years ago. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $3.6 billion. Other Bets CapEx was $869 million for the full-year, primarily reflecting investment in our Fiber business. Let me conclude with some comments about our continuing transformation of Alphabet. As Larry articulated in the 2013 Founders' Letter, and then, again, when announcing the creation of Alphabet, incrementalism in technology leads to irrelevance over time, because change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. This belief was the impetus for our organizational structure, which enhances focus on opportunities within Google and across Alphabet, while also pushing our leaders to extend the frontier that we are addressing. Consistent with the move to Alphabet, we expanded transparency internally regarding the expenses and CapEx required in each business, which benefited our 2016 budgeting process and capital allocation decision-making. As part of this process, we established technical and business targets for a number of the businesses to set the appropriate pace of investment. We made necessary choices to align resources with those efforts that maximize the potential for long-term value creation, prioritizing certain efforts, while making tough calls in Others. Given the fact that we are innovating in a number of exciting industries, in some areas, the optimal execution path could encourage accelerated investment. In Others, we continue to receive interest in exploring partnerships or alternate approaches to commercializing our efforts. Verily is a great example of where we formed strategic partnerships with companies like Dexcom, J&J, Novartis, and Sanofi in order to accelerate our efforts. My main point here is that we remain on a journey, and it is still early days. We are working diligently to build additional businesses that create long-term revenues, profits and value. Looking forward, a few observations. First, regarding revenue. As a reminder, the fourth quarter tends to be seasonally our strongest quarter, reflecting the benefit of the holidays. In addition, our GAAP results will continue to be affected by changes in the relative strength of the dollar. Second, operating expenses. As I said last quarter, our priority remains revenue growth, but that doesn't give us a pass on a rigorous approach to expense management. We continue to invest in longer-term opportunities within both Google and Other Bets, consistent with our emphasis on pushing the frontier to adjacent areas and moon shots. Given the early-stage nature of a number of these efforts, they are likely to require additional investment prior to generating meaningful revenues. Notably, in many ways, some of Alphabet's biggest moon shots are in Google itself, from driving the next wave of computing through machine learning, capitalizing on the shift to the cloud by enterprises, building platforms like virtual reality and pursuing the opportunities we see with the next billion users in emerging markets, you should expect Google to continue to invest in efforts to improve life for billions of people. Third, CapEx; as we've indicated previously, the vast majority of CapEx supports Google. We view our computing capacity as a core competence and will continue to invest here given our advantages in providing efficient, secure computing to support growth in both our consumer products and services globally as well as our Cloud and Apps businesses. In Other Bets, the majority of CapEx supports the ongoing deployment of Google Fiber. We're still operating in only a few cities, but have announced plans for additional cities, which we expect will be reflected in 2016 CapEx. Forth, our balance sheet. In 2016, we intend to align our capital structure with the Alphabet organization so that debt is held at the holding company level. That alignment would allow us to have greater flexibility as we continue to grow, including the ability to utilize debt financing, if appropriate, and consistent with our changing product mix. So my closing comment is that we saw tremendous revenue growth across our businesses and are applying discipline as we move to implement the Alphabet structure. I will now turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Ruth. It's great to be here to talk with you all again. Above all, our Q4 results show the great momentum and opportunity we have in mobile search and across Google's range of businesses. What's most exciting is the incredible enthusiasm for our products among consumers and our partners. Two things show this. First, on our last call, I shared that six of our consumer products, Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, and Google Play, all have over a billion monthly active users each. I'm pleased to share that Gmail now joins those ranks, crossing that number last quarter. Of course, all of these products are very popular and continue to grow rapidly on mobile. Second, there is incredible momentum behind the Android ecosystem, and the model is working at scale. This is a group of companies with whom we have worked really hard to build strong relationships. At the center of this are Android phones, and it's exciting to see the lineup of flagship devices our partners are working on this year. And there are newer areas, which are showing a lot of promise. In addition to an Android web partnership with New Balance and a new smartwatch from our friends at Casio, over 40 car brands worldwide are bringing Android Auto to their cars. Dozens of partners are integrating Android TV and Google Cast technology into living room products launching this year. I want to talk about two main things today. First, some thoughts on the approach we are taking to drive the next wave of innovation, and then, some thoughts on our advertising business and our newer emerging businesses. First, a few words on our approach. At Google, we've always tried to bring our unique technical strengths to areas where we think we can make a big difference, like indexing the world's information to make it discoverable. We have focused a lot on really improving search in mobile and now we are investing in evolving this to actively assist our users throughout the day in smart and helpful ways. This comes thanks to our years of investments in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, knowledge graph and other areas. And the next wave will be powered by big advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, an area where we believe we lead the industry. Just last week, DeepMind published an incredible result, the first ever to master the game of Go with artificial intelligence. An amazing accomplishment, and I'm excited for the world championship in March. And in November, we open-sourced TensorFlow, our new machine learning system, to help accelerate discovery and development in the field. Machine learning is making our products smarter and more useful for people every day. It powers Smart Reply, in Inbox by Gmail, which suggests short responses that are relevant to an incoming email. People absolutely love this feature. In fact, in just a few months, Smart Reply already makes up 10% of all mobile responses in Inbox. From image recognition in photos to eliminating email spam to better translation and voice recognition, our machine learning efforts are making a huge difference for people every day. In sum, we believe we've only scratched the surface of truly being there for our users anytime, anywhere, across all devices, giving them the assistance they need. We are excited to make even more progress on this vision in 2016. The second part of our approach is to make sure we are solving big problems for everyone. We believe that someone in Indonesia should get the same quality email service or search results as someone in New York. This quarter I visited Korea, Vietnam, and India to speak with partners, developers, and students. It was a very inspiring trip. I even sat down at a local coffee shop with Dong Nguyen, the creator of the popular Flappy Bird game, which has inspired Vietnam's growing community of developers and startups to think hard about how to create worldwide hits. From providing Internet access in India's railway stations to making Chromebooks available throughout the region, it reinforced what a huge opportunity we have to help the next 1 billion users come online and to have great experiences with the whole Internet once they are there. That's why creating open platforms that anyone can build on is core to Google's DNA, from Chrome to Android to Brillo to our latest virtual reality efforts. It's still incredibly early innings for virtual reality as a platform, and Cardboard is just the first step, but we are excited by the progress we have seen. Our partners have shipped over 5 million Google Cardboard viewers, and we recently teamed up with The New York Times on a virtual reality experience in which over 1 million Times subscribers received Cardboard. And since launching in September, the Expeditions Pioneer Program has helped more than 500,000 students travel to places like the bottom of the sea or the surface of Mars. Beyond these early efforts, you'll see a lot more from us and our partners in 2016. Now turning to the trends and highlights that we are seeing across our advertising business as well as some of the newer areas. It's hard to believe that AdWords just celebrated its 15th birthday. Just like Google Search and the computing devices we all use now, the product is largely unrecognizable from the first version that launched in 2000, but the key value proposition remains unchanged. Google helps advertisers reach the right customer at precisely the right micro-moment when they are looking to buy something, go somewhere, know something, or do something. Mobile is really helping us making these connections for marketers. As Ruth mentioned, Mobile Search was particularly strong in the fourth quarter. This holiday season, we found that shopping moments replaced shopping marathons. Shoppers turned to their mobile devices to purchase gifts online in spare moments throughout the day all season long, and marketers turned to our mobile ad offerings to reach those customers. And people are actively buying products when searching on mobile. Our research shows that 30% of all online shopping purchases now happen on mobile phones. In fact, in the U.S., looking just at product listing ads, revenue from mobile phones exceeded desktop on Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and through the weekend. Not only were people using mobile ads to shop online, they also used their phones to find the best products and prices in stores around them. Our local inventory ads help people see if a product they are looking for is in stock at a retailer nearby. Marketers at Lowe's and Target find them useful because they can measure the foot traffic that their search ads drove. In fact, thanks to local inventory ads, Target reported millions of incremental store visits in the week leading up to Christmas. We also continue to see great success in driving app downloads. Our app promotion offerings like Universal App Campaigns, which help marketers easily run campaigns in Google Play, YouTube, Search, and across our Display Network, are getting great traction and delivering results for advertisers. We are now seeing a trend of advertisers moving their app install budgets to Google. Now moving to video, people watch hundreds of millions of hours on YouTube every day, and it continues to be a must-have for all brand advertisers. Not only does YouTube on mobile reach more 18 to 49-year-olds than any cable network in the U.S., but the time people spent watching YouTube in the living room more than doubled in 2015. Brands turn to YouTube to inspire and engage potential customers. And with our recently launched Shoppable TrueView Ads, marketers like Michael Kors can connect the dots between inspiration and purchase. And it is brands of all sizes. In fact, over the last two years, the number of small and medium-sized businesses advertising on YouTube has doubled. We also continue to expand measurement options for marketers on YouTube to help them better understand the effectiveness of their ad spend. In addition to our own measurement tools, we recently introduced support for third-party viewability vendors on YouTube. YouTube is also a powerful platform for creators. Today, any creator can upload a video to YouTube and get discovered by over 1 billion people around the world. That global exposure has allowed YouTube and Google to pay out over $3 billion to the record industry to date. We are also investing in the future of video. You can now watch the VR videos on YouTube, and content creators can now film in new YouTube spaces in Paris and Mumbai. Between incredibly strong viewership growth, the move of advertising budgets to digital video, great new features, as well as the successful rollouts of YouTube Music and our YouTube Red subscription offering, I couldn't be more excited about the prospects for YouTube in the years ahead. In programmatic video and display, we continue to see strong momentum. More marketers and publishers use programmatic automated ad buying and tools through our DoubleClick platform this holiday season than ever before. Programmatic video impressions doubled compared to the holiday season last year. And in the week leading up to Black Friday, more than 60% of programmatic impressions came from mobile devices. Lastly, I'll discuss some of our newer business areas, where we continue to see tremendous potential. Google Play, our hub for digital content, continues to see great momentum. In 2015, spend per buyer in the Play Store grew by more than 30% globally compared to 2014. We had particularly strong growth in this area in countries like Brazil, India, Indonesia and Mexico, thanks to continued investments in payments capabilities. On Hardware, as you know, last quarter, we launched the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P in more than 30 countries. They are truly great examples of the best that Android can offer and have gotten great reviews. And the adoption of Chromebooks continues to gain a ton of momentum, particularly in education. Before I wrap up, I want to share some thoughts on our Cloud and Apps group. Public Cloud services are a natural place for us, so we established a business unit late last year to take full advantage of the opportunity. I'm excited that Diane Greene, a highly respected industry vet, joined to lead it. As you know, Google pioneered the Cloud at scale. Our data centers have handled the workload of Google's own products from Search to YouTube for 17 years. We are able to take that infrastructure and computing power and optimize it for all customers. Our data centers, infrastructure, machine learning, and premium data services are leaders in the Cloud space as is our price-to-performance ratio. And we are now able to bring this to bear just as the movement to Cloud has reached a tipping point. Businesses now see that the easiest-to-use, most price-effective and secure infrastructure can best be obtained through the major public cloud providers. Google cloud platform is already used by more than four million applications. And we recently introduced a new way to purchase and use virtual machines, called Custom Machine Types, so that clients can tailor their purchases based on the memory they need to get the best possible cost and performance. Our business collaboration and productivity suite, Google Apps, now incorporates the best of Google's new technologies like machine learning and natural language processing. Our adoption now extends from large healthcare providers to retailers, to government. Last quarter, Catholic Health Initiatives, the nation's second largest non-profit health system with more than 100,000 employees, announced its move to Google Apps. There's great buzz at Google around this area, and we continue to heavily ramp up investment here. I want to say thank you to all of the Googlers around the world for their amazing work, from Cloud computing, digital video, and the mobile revolution, to machine learning, virtual reality, and helping the next billion get online. Google has a front row seat on the trends that will define computing in the coming years. There is truly no more exciting place to come to work every day. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Sundar. We will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Carlos Kirjner from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Carlos Kirjner-Neto: Hello, thank you for taking my questions. I have a couple. First, Sundar, do you believe there is a non-trivial chance of Google and the DeepMind team achieving strong AI in the next five years or so? And secondly, on your revenues, can you tell us what do you feel the drivers of Sites revenue growth and what seems to be an acceleration have legs and are more like improving this experience in advertiser returns and less like increasing ad lows, which one could argue have a limited headway? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Carlos. I'll answer the first, and turn it over to Ruth on the second. On AI, we are obviously seeing incredible progress in this field. We make great strides, and we start taking it for granted and look to the years ahead. It's always tough to predict what happens over a five-year timeframe, but I do see us making significant strides. Even a year ago, I wouldn't have predicted that we would be in a strong position to mount a serious challenge to the world champion in Go this year. So looking at the pace of progress, I think we will have AI in a form in which it benefits a lot of users in the coming years, but I still think it's early days, and there's a long-term investment for us. Ruth Porat : And then, on Sites' revenue, what the results reflect is, is product strength, geographic breadth, and obviously, the added backdrop of an active holiday season with the Sites' revenue up 20% year-on-year notwithstanding the currency impact. The way we look at it is we've got extraordinary capability and strength in Search, and then ongoing innovation across the platform. As we talked about last quarter, we did benefit from a change made in Q3 in ad format with respect to mobile search and we do continue to benefit from that change. Mobile search growth was the biggest driver again this quarter. And then, in terms of YouTube, the momentum continues. The story continues to be about strong growth in video advertising, TrueView and Google Preferred as distinct from Display on YouTube. And then, just to round it out, desktop search remains a solid contributor as well. Carlos Kirjner-Neto: Thank you. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Eric J. Sheridan: Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two on margins now that we have the new disclosure \u2013 and thanks for all of that information. With core Google, we saw a very nice operating margin improvement in 2015 versus 2014. Wanted to know if we could get a little bit color on what drove that, whether it was incremental revenue, pricing, cost efficiency, how you sort of think about what drove that? And the opposite for Other Bets, clearly, a bigger loss in 2015 versus 2014. Maybe a little bit of color on the volatility as you called it out, and how that might develop over time. Thank you. Ruth Porat : Certainly. So starting with Other Bets, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're at the beginning of a journey with the creation of Alphabet and breaking this out into the segments is a meaningful step. As you look at some of the numbers, the reason I said it's more instructive to look at annual or rolling 12 months is that there can be some lumpy things on a quarterly basis, but we're continuing to invest across the businesses as we talked about. So that would explain the 2014/2015 trend here. It just underscores that we're investing in the business, we've made some tough choices, and as I said, in terms of how we're allocated across the various businesses, but an important area for us and tried to give you the sizing here in the segment information. And then, in terms of overall Google, we're continuing to invest there as well. We're investing quite meaningfully, as I previously said, the 70-20-10 model is an instructive framework that Larry's articulated for a long time. And as I tried to stress in my opening comments, we're looking to push the frontier both within Google and Other Bets. So ongoing innovation is key to all that we're doing in Google, and it's benefiting users and the ecosystem broadly. So you're continuing to see us invest there, and notwithstanding, that you see the results that you have here today. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Heather Anne Bellini : Great, thank you. Sundar, thank you for the color on your initiatives with the Cloud, and we're all very excited about Diane Greene's hiring. I was wondering if you could share with us when you were having conversations with corporate customers over the last 12 months, what were the biggest areas of change or things that they said Google needed to work on in order to win over their Cloud business versus, say, them choosing to go with an AWS or an Azure? And can you talk to us about how that change might progress and how we might see that filter through in 2016? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Heather. I'm very excited to have Diane here as well. We are already getting significant traction. It's a strongly growing business for us. And we plan to invest significantly in 2016. It'll be one of our major investment areas. In terms of talking to customers, first of all, as I said earlier, the Cloud platform is now already used and trusted by over four million applications. And a lot of it is about making sure we are very seriously committed to the space, which we are. And in terms of wanting, there's a breadth of feature requirements, and so we've been carefully taking customer feedback and addressing all those needs. And as time goes by, I think we are getting very competitive. We have natural advantages in doing this, but we also need to make sure we address all the feature needs, and that's what we've been focused on. And I think we are at a point now where the product is ready to be used at scale. And so I expect to get significant traction in 2016. Heather Anne Bellini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : Sundar, could you talk a little bit about \u2013 provide any milestones for autonomous vehicles and Nest? They're two of the Other Bets that we're particularly intrigued by here. I know they're very long-term bets, but the milestones that you've seen that kind of give you confidence in the forward direction of those businesses? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So I'll take that. Those are two of the businesses that are, as we call them, Other Bets. Look, on the self-driving cars, we have an extraordinary tech team. We've been working on it for many years, and the focus is developing technology with a real emphasis on safety and understanding what it takes to build and operate fully autonomous vehicles. We continue to make great progress. We've now driven 1.3 million miles with important data regarding the safety and utility, and that's what we're really focused on. We've got prototypes on streets in two cities. So we're continuing to execute against that and continuing to build it out. And then, on Nest, we have now more than 14,000 developers who've joined the Works with Nest program, enabling them to connect with Nest products through the Cloud. The team refreshed the entire product portfolio in 2015. That resulted in very strong year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, and again, similarly, they're just executing against that business plan. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thanks, Mark. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Justin Post : Thank you. Ruth, I wondered if you could give us a little bit more detail on the U.S. acceleration. It's been pretty strong four quarters in a row. Is that YouTube and Search? Any more detail on that would really be helpful if those individual businesses have accelerated. And then, on the Other Bets business, clearly, and you mentioned milestones a couple of times, the losses have really increased over the last two quarters. Could you share any of those milestones with us? Thank you. Ruth Porat : Sure. So starting with the U.S., I think the main point is that we've had meaningful growth in all geographies, reflecting the product strength and the added tailwind of the holiday season. And looking forward, we would expect typical seasonal patterns to hold Q4. As you know well, it tends to be our strongest quarter. But specifically on the U.S., that as we talked about last quarter, really reflects the diversity of our products here. Each is doing well. Mobile growth, as both Sundar and I talked about, was the key driver yet again. But YouTube and programmatic continue to deliver strong growth, and that translates into the results that you saw for the U.S. We obviously had a nice lift from retail, no surprise given the holiday season. But I think simply put, it's the diversity of doing a lot across a lot of different products. And then in terms of the milestones and your question regarding Other Bets, as I mentioned in the opening comments, results this quarter were affected by project milestones. Those milestones were established several years ago. And that's why I called out that it could be lumpy on a quarterly basis and why we look at it over a year, over rolling 12 months, and I'm not going to break it out in more detail than that. As Larry said, when we announced Alphabet, it's an exciting new chapter. It is about getting more ambitious things done. We're doing that in a framework to ensure we are disciplined with our resources, and this was just calling out a milestone established some time ago. Justin Post : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Okay, thank you. Sundar, you just called out Gmail as the latest among your products to reach 1 billion users. So I guess at this point, you're explicitly monetizing Search, YouTube, and Gmail to some degree, while some of the other products maybe they're a bit more nascent are still not monetized or under-monetized, it seems. So big picture as you look at the next 1 billion users who want to come online and use your products, are you in any hurry to begin monetization at all? And, Ruth, I think since you came on board, CapEx is down basically every quarter. Granted, fourth quarter of 2014 had the discretionary real estate purchase in there, but in your budgeting process for 2016, is the nature of what you're going to be spending money on changing much at all for core Google? And in regards to the CapEx for the Other Bets, being primarily for Fiber, it seems like there are six upcoming cities and 11 potential cities. What is the green-lighting process for whether a city gets considered or not? Okay, thanks. Sundar Pichai : Great. I take a very long-term view towards this. When we look at the scale of mobile for the first time in our lifetime, so I think we have a platform which is going to reach one day the entirety of the world's population, so it will be over 5 billion users. And from our standpoint, core to our mission, we want to be in a position where we are helping users throughout the day. We are assisting users with their core information needs across all our products. And I think if we do that well, a lot of that information is commercial, and hence our monetization works effectively as well, as you've seen this year. And so very focused on long-term building that user experience to be assisting users, and that's the framework with which we think about it. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of CapEx, you've noted the important difference on a year-over-year basis a couple of sizable real estate items as part of our facilities expansion that we called out last year on top of continued investment in our technical infrastructure. But really to the heart of your question, looking ahead for 2016, we do expect to see accelerated investment in CapEx, and that's to support both Google and Other Bets. As we often talk about, we view our technical infrastructure as a key strategic asset for the company. We have terrific scale and efficiency, and the team has done an extraordinary job innovating to achieve efficiencies following a period of heavier investment in 2014. So we're now delivering about three times the compute power for the same amount of power or dollars we did five years ago. And that's an important point because it explains some of the slower CapEx in 2015. But given our commitment to have the most potent infrastructure, we do expect to increase CapEx in 2016. And for Google, that is intended to continue to support growth in our consumer products and services globally as well as all that we're doing for our enterprise clients, as Sundar has already talked about, so CapEx in both areas there. And then, in terms of Fiber and what we're doing more broadly in Other Bets, Fiber will continue to be, we expect, the biggest consumer. And again, you identified the driver of it. It obviously increases as we execute in a growing number of cities. One of the main things that also affected 2015 is the rollout was really measured as we worked to enhance the construction process and efficiency, doing things like developing relationships with cities and establishing protocol with construction partners, but we have more cities announced. And obviously, as we execute on those, that takes more CapEx as well. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Thank you. Ruth Porat : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Douglas T. Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions, two things. First, Sundar, if you could, talk a little bit about YouTube. It's been several quarters now where you've talked about the mix shift toward TrueView ads bringing down the average CPC for Sites. But can you talk about the trend that you're seeing there more on a like-for-like basis, and whether in theory that should tighten up more relative to search ads going forward? And then, secondly, Ruth, on the core Google business, we've seen roughly 300 basis points of margin expansion here over the last year or so. I know you're talking obviously about the investments around cloud and machine learning. Do you think there is still potential there for profitability to improve in that segment? Thanks. Ruth Porat : Let me start first on YouTube monetization. There's really no change from my comment last quarter. YouTube had very healthy revenue growth, again, driven by growth in TrueView and other video ads, but the monetization story is still evolving. It's still early innings, and we're focused on the opportunity to get larger offline budgets moved to YouTube. Given the level of user engagement globally and the compelling nature of demographics, it does remain a very attractive platform. In the near term, given the growth in viewership, YouTube TrueView CPC pricing is expected to continue to affect our overall Sites monetization mix. And then in terms of Google and margin outlook I think is really what you're getting at, I'll go back to my prior comment. What we achieved here by pulling out the two pieces is providing, obviously, greater visibility into what we're investing within the Other Bets, but want to underscore that we continue to invest in Google. We're in early innings in many areas. And I already referenced back to the framework we use, which is to continue to push the frontier within Google as well to adjacent areas. You named one, we've talked about it on this call, it's very important, Cloud and Apps, and all that we're looking to invest there. But we're doing more than that. It's also the moon shot areas, it's virtual reality and other areas, and these are exciting early-stage efforts. We do expect we'll be in a position to discuss in greater detail over time. I'll let you estimate the short-term impact, but we believe the investment is really important as we're enhancing the long-term potential for Google and continuing to really enrich the ecosystem. Douglas T. Anmuth: Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just to go back to the YouTube comments you made and the progress in the living rooms and the progress of the YouTube Red, can you just talk a little bit about how you think about potentially going into more original scripted longer form content, or even licensed longer form content to go after even a larger share of offline ad budgets? And then, secondly, the rest of world, can you just talk about what you're seeing in the emerging market CPCs on a constant currency basis? How big is that gap now between the emerging markets in the U.S. and how do you think about closing that longer term? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : On YouTube, let me answer first on YouTube. On YouTube, obviously, the overall momentum has been great. We have over a billion users watching hundreds of millions of hours. To me interestingly \u2013 sorry. Let me answer the YouTube question first. On YouTube, we have great momentum. We have over a billion users watching hundreds of millions of hours. And in fact, 80% of YouTube's views are from outside of the U.S. It's been an incredible year where I feel the team is on fire, focusing on launching YouTube Red, YouTube Music. And as you saw at Sundance, a big push on YouTube Originals with a focus from our top creators to create exclusive content for YouTube Red users. And so I'm really excited about all the new investments we are doing there, and users are responding very positively. And so I think it's going to be an exciting 2016 for YouTube. Ruth Porat : And then, in the rest of worlds, it's already growing at a high rate off a large base. And we're really pleased with the ongoing progress there. In addition to mobile, we benefited from Play and our Universal App Campaigns, as Sundar said. We're continuing to invest meaningfully in rest of world. We view it as a very sizable opportunity, bringing the next four billion online and all the opportunities there. So that's really the main focus for us at this point, is continuing to build out availability, access, and products for the rest of world. Brian Nowak : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Vogel from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Paul Vogel : Great. Thanks. Just two questions. One, just going back to CPCs real quickly, if we were to normalize out both TrueView and currency, I'm just wondering, any comments on how core search is doing and just how core mobile search is doing from a pricing standpoint. And then second, just on the CapEx side, I'm just curious how you think about utilization across all of your products? And you obviously spent a lot in the past, are we at a good spot? Do we need to spend ahead? Or is there a lot of capacity that isn't being utilized right now? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So in terms of CPCs, other than YouTube, I guess, the other comments to add are in the fourth quarter, we did see an impact from the ad format changes that we talked about in the third quarter. That also increased our overall click base. And we believe this click growth is a positive indicator of ads that are proving to be more relevant to users. In other words, the CPC trend reflects the fact that the denominator's growing faster than the numerator. But we do view that as a long-term upside opportunity for both CPCs and revenue. So mobile continues to be very healthy as evidenced as I tried to indicate in my opening comments and Sundar did as well. And similarly, Desktop growth remains very healthy. In terms of CapEx, I guess, the main point is we do expect it will be increasing in 2016. I've already address that. I think part of it's you got in the way you asked the question, which is we've achieved efficiencies after this heavy spend in 2014. And that's where the team was very focused, is we ramped up spend, and then we've been focused on how to extract the most efficiency here. And that, as I said, does explain some of the slower CapEx in 2015, and the reason we've been very focused on indicating that it will be increasing to support all that we're doing. It's quite a bit of requirements on both the Google side and what we're doing in Other Bets, and Fiber specifically. So part of it was the 2014 spend and the digestion in 2015. Paul Vogel : Great, thank you very much. Ruth Porat : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ross Sandler : Great. Thanks. I just have two questions for Sundar. Most of them have been answered already. But on the UK, Sundar, it's now growing over 20% despite a tougher comp. And that's the most mature digital advertising economy globally. And we haven't been over 20% at Google for three-plus years. So is this mostly a function of mobile search hitting its strides? Is there anything else that's driving that growth up? And what do you think that says about the maturity or lack thereof of digital advertising globally as we look at all other regions? And then, you also made the comment during the prepared remarks that ARPU for Play, I believe you were referring to Play is up 30%. Is that on a like-for-like geo basis? And is that a function of the personalization efforts that Google has been doing within Play? Or is that more a function of just the overall content flowing through Play evolving and maturing? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On the first half, when I think about growth, you're right. And as Ruth mentioned earlier, too, mobile search, YouTube, they're all working well. But I would take into account overall a secular shift to mobile, how users are adopting mobile. And on top of that, I think we're working hard to serve our users well on mobile. So it's a combination of all of that, and I think the model is working well. On Play, to be very clear, spend per buyer is up 30%, and that's globally. And it's a function of, as you pointed out, I think we've made good strides in terms of personalizing the experience for each user. And I think that's borne fruit. But a lot of it is also improving our ability to handle payments for users and developers, and to do that better through time at a global scale. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Mark May from Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Mark A. May: Thank you. I think they're both for Ruth. I just wanted to make sure I was interpreting your comments correctly earlier. You talked about looking at the trendline on a trailing 12-month basis with the Other Bets losses to give a sense of the trendline. I think operating losses roughly doubled on a year-on-year basis on a trailing basis. Is that sort of the trajectory that you're wanting us to think about going forward? And then, more of a housekeeping question around Other Bets, can you just describe what you mean by project milestones and maybe provide an example of that? And then, on the Search business, can you talk about what sort of progress that you've seen in the auction in terms of closing the gap between the average mobile CPC and desktop? Thanks. Ruth Porat : So the trend, when I talked about looking at an annual or rolling 12-month to assess trends, it was really to say that there can be idiosyncrasies on a quarterly basis that \u2013 so it leads to a lumpiness, just again, given how early-stage these are, and any particular events in one or more companies can affect the overall numbers. It was not intended to, say, take the 2014 over 2015 and extrapolate, far from it. The budgeting process that we went through was a very rigorous process. As I said my opening comments, we prioritized some, we made some tough calls, but very much with a view of having a very disciplined envelope around the way we are looking at the opportunities we have across the Other Bets. And so we look them again opportunity by opportunity. In terms of the milestones, they can really vary for a number of things, but it would be linked to anything at the company, which, in our view, whether it's technically or from a business perspective, advances the development of the company, the value of the company, and we're not going to go into detail on each one of the specific companies. I think your second question was around Search in terms of the monetization trends in Search, and I think I've already addressed that one as well. When I first provided color on desktop and mobile, the point is really about the health of both of them, and as I've already said here on this call, mobile continues to outperform, desktop growth remains healthy. And with all the comments that both Sundar and I made with respect to mobile, it should be clear that mobile search revenue was up significantly this quarter. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Ellen West for any further remarks. Ellen West : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you again on our first quarter 2016 call. Thank you and good afternoon. Operator : Well, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. I will now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Ellen West, head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ellen West : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now, I'll turn the call over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thanks. Our very strong revenue of $20.3 billion in Q1 underscored the great momentum of our businesses globally, with consolidated revenue growth again accelerating meaningfully, up 23% in constant currency versus last year. The primary driver was the increased use of Mobile Search by consumers, benefiting from our ongoing efforts to enhance the Mobile Search experience. We also benefited from solid growth in desktop and tablet search as well as continued strength in YouTube and programmatic advertising. We continue to rationalize our portfolio of products to ensure we efficiently and effectively focus our resources behind our biggest bets across Alphabet. I will present to you in the following order : first, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet; second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets; finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions. Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance, total revenue was $20.3 billion, up 17% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $762 million or $593 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 23% year-over-year and declined 4% sequentially, reflecting holiday seasonality. Once again, Alphabet revenues by geography highlight both the strength of our business around the globe as well as the impact that currency headwinds continue to have on our non-U.S. business. U.S. revenue was up 21% year-over-year to $9.4 billion and down 9% versus Q4. UK revenue was up 15% year-over-year to $1.9 billion and flat sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 21% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter. Rest of world revenue was up 14% versus last year to $9 billion and down 2% versus Q4. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 25% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. GAAP other cost of revenues were $3.9 billion. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.6 billion, up 27% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, most notably due to costs associated with operating our data centers including depreciation, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube and hardware costs related to sales of new Nexus, Chromecast and Pixel devices launched in the fall. GAAP operating expenses were $7.3 billion in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6 billion or 30% of revenue, up 11% year-over-year and down 9% versus Q4. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by R&D expense, mainly due to compensation expense related to head count growth. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $5.3 billion, up 20% versus last year. The operating margin was 26%. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.8 billion, up 21% versus last year. The operating margin was 34%. With respect to stock-based compensation, it totaled $1.5 billion, up 24% year-over-year, and up 4% sequentially, primarily reflecting increased head count and the impact of our senior executive equity refresh that occurs every two years. Head count at the end of the quarter was 64,115, up approximately 2,300 from last quarter. The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product managers in areas where we've prioritized investment, such as cloud and apps. On a numbers basis, we're adding more head count in Google, while on a percentage basis, we're growing faster in Other Bets. Other income and expense was negative $213 million. As discussed on prior calls, OI&E consists of a number of line items with different drivers, which makes it inherently unpredictable. The key drivers this quarter were the ongoing drag from foreign exchange, given the volatility in currency markets as well as losses recorded for marketable and non-marketable securities. These items offset interest income from our investment portfolio, which remains fairly consistent. Our effective tax rate was 18%, reflecting the geographic mix of our income and adoption of a new accounting standard that reflects certain SBC tax benefits in GAAP earnings that were previously recognized in equity. We have excluded these benefits in our non-GAAP earnings. Net income was $4.2 billion on a GAAP basis and $5.2 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $6.02 on a GAAP basis and $7.50 on a non-GAAP basis. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google segment. Operating cash flow was $7.7 billion, with free cash flow of $5.2 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $75.3 billion, of which approximately $45 billion, or 60%, is held overseas. This reflects our strong operating cash flow, offset by the impact of our share repurchases during the quarter of approximately $2.1 billion. Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment, revenue was $20.1 billion, up 17% year-over-year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $14.3 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Year-on-year growth reflects substantial strength in Mobile Search due to the ongoing benefit from the improvement in ad formats and delivery that we launched in the third quarter of last year. We continue to have solid growth from desktop and tablet search. YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred, with a growing contribution from app promotion. Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 3% year-on-year and down 11% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of programmatic offset by the traditional network businesses. Other revenue for Google was $2.1 billion, up 24% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Year-over-year performance was driven by Play as well as continued strong growth in cloud and apps and a nice contribution from hardware. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. As a reminder, these metrics similarly are affected by currency movements. Total traffic acquisition costs were $3.8 billion, or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 13% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. The increase in both Sites TAC and Network TAC as a percentage of revenue reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Operating income, excluding SBC, was $7.6 billion, up 22% versus last year, for an operating margin of 38%. Google stock-based compensation totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 25% year-over-year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $6.3 billion, up 21% versus last year, and the operating margin was 31%. CapEx for the quarter was $2 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction. Turning to Other Bets financials, as a reminder, the majority of these efforts are pre-revenue. We continue to invest across these opportunities, doing so in a disciplined way. Because Other Bets results aggregate the revenues and expenses from a number of businesses operating in different industries, there is likely to be lumpiness in the reported results from quarter-to-quarter, which is why we think it remains most instructive to look at them over a longer time horizon. For Q1, Other Bets revenue was $166 million, up 108% versus last year. Reported revenue for Other Bets was primarily generated by Nest, Verily and Fiber. Operating loss, excluding SBC, was $657 million in the first quarter. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $802 million. Other Bets CapEx was $280 million in Q1, primarily reflecting ongoing investment in our Fiber business. Look forward, a few observations, first, regarding revenue; our culture of innovation drives our strong revenue growth. We've talked previously about the benefits from changes made to ad formats and delivery in the third quarter of 2015 and that continues to be a tailwind. Mobile, as an example, continues to offer sizable opportunity for revenue enhancement, given the increasing ubiquity of mobile use by consumers and the strong location and contextual signals from mobile devices. Although we remain intensely focused on innovation across Alphabet, the timing and magnitude of ongoing changes, obviously, are inherently uncertain and are not designed with an eye toward quarterly schedules. Second, as to expenses; within Google, we continue to be focused on managing the expenses that we can actually control, as you can see from our results again this quarter. However, the secular trends driving revenue are accompanied by greater required investment in our ecosystem to support that revenue growth, most specifically the continued trend of higher TAC due to an ongoing change in mix within our Sites and Network businesses. Third, regarding CapEx; as we have consistently said, technical infrastructure is a key strategic asset for us. We have tremendous scale and continue to add to it. The team continues to deliver innovative solutions that are creating meaningful efficiencies in machine use, allowing us to benefit from earlier investments and meet our growing Google requirements cost effectively. With regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, the bulk of that is directed to our Fiber business, where CapEx should obviously increase as we execute in a growing number of cities. Fourth, about our balance sheet; as I discussed on our Q4 call, last quarter, we initiated steps to align our capital structure consistent with the move to Alphabet, providing greater flexibility as we continue to grow. Our exchange offer will be completed on April 25, and we have completed the move of our commercial paper and revolving credit facility from Google to Alphabet. Finally, our strategic prioritization; as I indicated last quarter, there are a number of different execution paths we are pursuing to optimize our investments and opportunities. In some areas, we will be increasing investment if teams meet milestones we set as part of our 2016 budgeting process. In other areas, we've chosen to work with industry-leading partners who can increase our momentum. Finally, in certain areas where we have had multiple teams developing different approaches to a similar technology, we've been evaluating how to rationalize these approaches, enabling us to increase investments around a smaller, more focused set of opportunities. So my closing comment is that in Q1, we continued to see tremendous revenue growth across our businesses, and we remain focused on disciplined investing for the long-term. I will now turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Ruth. It's great to join you all today. Our teams are off to a great start this year and there is even more excitement in the month ahead as we gear up for big events, like: our annual developer conference, Google I/O; our YouTube event, Brandcast; and the Google Performance Summit for advertisers. Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. And after 17 years, we have just scratched the surface of what's possible. We are reinvigorated around this mission and, as you will hear, we are making solid progress across many of our products. Today, I'll quickly share a few highlights from the quarter, as well as some of the areas where we are investing to make our products more useful and intelligent. Then, I'll give an update on our Advertising business and our growing Cloud business. A few highlights from the quarter; we continued to invest in making Search more useful and assistive. In the early days, when you did a search on your desktop, we gave you 10 blue links then sent you on your way. Users still had to do too much work to find the information they were looking for. We have made a lot of improvements over the years to add more comprehensive and assistive information right within the search results. For instance, 10 years ago, if you tried to find the score during your favorite soccer team's match, we'd likely point you to some news articles or the team's website. Today, we show the live scores for nearly 200 soccer leagues across 70 countries, so fans around the world can quickly find information, like upcoming schedules, team news and conference standings right in the search results. We are incredibly well-positioned to better assist our users, thanks to our strengths in areas like search, geographical information, machine learning, image recognition and natural language processing. One of the key ingredients behind this push towards greater assistance is AI. We have long invested in building the best machine learning team and tools, and we are seeing these efforts bear fruit in many ways. As many of you saw last month, DeepMind's AlphaGo has been making great strides. It was a privilege to play legendary Go player, Lee Sedol, in such an important milestone for artificial intelligence. This is another step to what's creating AI that could help us with everything from our daily tasks to potentially even bigger challenges like climate change and cancer diagnosis. At Google, machine learning is already helping us improve our products every day in search and many other areas like photos, maps and more. Last quarter, I talked about how machine learning helps Smart Reply suggest responses in Inbox. This quarter, we launched Goals in Google Calendar, an intelligent feature that helps users make the most of their time. You just add a personal goal, like run three times a week, and Calendar will help you find the time, then help you stick it to. There's still a lot more that we can do to make Search and other Google services more assistive and helpful to you. You'll see a lot more from us this year. On the content side, we are seeing great traction on Google Play and YouTube. YouTube still has incredible momentum, and we continue to invest heavily here. What seemed like a moon shot a decade ago has grown into a booming community of engaged users, creators and brands, unlike any other video platform. YouTube on mobile alone now reaches more 18 to 34 and 18 to 49 year olds in the U.S. than any TV network, broadcast or cable. This past quarter, we launched YouTube Originals, original content available on our premium service YouTube Red. And we are very pleased with how it's been going. And earlier this week, we announced that we are make 360-degree live streaming available globally on YouTube. We are kicking things off by live streaming select performances at Coachella for fans around the world in 360 degrees. Google Play remains a thriving hub for digital content across apps, games, music, movies, TV and books. Game developers of all sizes are building successful businesses in the Play Store thanks to its global reach of over 1 billion users. In fact, in 2015, we saw 50% more games reach over 1 million installs compared to the previous year. And we keep adding great content to Google Play. For instance, performances by artists like Coldplay and Justin Bieber from the 2016 BRIT Awards that are available exclusively on Google Play Music. When we talk about great content, the mobile web is equally important. This quarter, our simple, fast and secure browser, Chrome, reached another important milestone, surpassing 1 billion monthly active users on mobile alone. And, of course, one of the keys to a great mobile experience is fast content. As you know, we have teamed up with hundreds of publishers and tech companies to improve the mobile web for everyone with accelerated mobile pages. Early data shows that these pages load four times faster and use 10 times less data than traditional pages. We recently made it easy to find AMP in relevant Mobile Search and Google News results, giving users a lightning-fast reading experience for top stories. And there are great advertising opportunities for publishers in these new fast pages. Another example is progress of Web Apps, which combine the best of the web and apps allowing companies to build mobile sites that load quickly, send push notifications, have home screen icons and much more. Of course, computing is the foundational layer through which all our products are delivered. In March, we previewed the Android N release to give developers an early look at what's coming in the next version of our software. This release has key features like multi-window support, direct-reply notifications and battery efficiencies. We're also building for future platforms. We expanded Android Auto to Brazil, and Android Wear partners, like Michael Kors and Fossil, also announced that they are working on new devices coming later this year. In our newest platform, VR, we also recently introduced VR view, a quick and easy way for developers to include 360-degree VR images and videos in their apps and websites. Now, moving on to some of the key drivers and trends in our advertising business; as people turn to their mobile phones in moments of high intent, which we call micro moments, Google has a compelling value proposition. We offer marketers four things : the best ways to target commercial intent at the right moment; the best mobile ad formats; the best reach and range of quality inventory; and the leading measurement solutions. First, thanks to our unique interim signals, we are able to connect marketers with the right customer precisely the right time. A new example of this is Customer Match, which helps brands reach their most valued customers on Google Search, YouTube and Gmail, with highly relevant and targeted ads. After using Customer Match to reactivate their loyal customers, specialty retailer Williams-Sonoma reported a 50% lift in revenue compared to previous campaigns that didn't use Customer Match. Second, we continue to invest in the best new mobile ad formats, tailored to help users find exactly what they need at the right moment. For example, we rolled out Model Automotive Ads, which helps automakers recreate the showroom experience by featuring images of cars alongside helpful information right in the Mobile Search results. On average, participating brands see a more than 30% increase in engagement rate with these new automotive ads compared to standard text ads. Third, we provide advertisers with the best reach in inventory across many of the web's most coveted platforms. Marketers like HBO Now are seeing great results from our popular app (23:10) promotion offerings like Universal App Campaigns, (23:13) which helps advertisers easily run campaigns in Google Play, YouTube, Search and across our Display network. In fact, in January, we saw a 200% year-over-year increase in ad-driven installs on Android alone. And in our burgeoning Programmatic business, we recently rolled out Programmatic Guaranteed, a new way to conduct better deals between advertisers and publishers on high quality inventory. And fourth, we give marketers powerful measurement tools, so they know exactly how effective their ads are. Just this week, we announced the availability of sales lift studies to help consumer packaged brands better understand how their online videos are driving offline sales. This adds to our significant efforts in this area. I want to specifically highlight the success we are seeing with YouTube advertising. As YouTube continues to grow, with great content and engaged users, marketers can't get enough. For example, Microsoft Xbox hosted a six hour live streamed event on YouTube for their Halo 5 opening week promoted with TrueView ads where 8 million people tuned in, helping it break sales records. Excitement is especially high as we head into our annual Brandcast event coming up next month. Thanks to the success of Google Preferred, this is the third year in a row we are making it the cornerstone of our offering to marketers. In fact, number of brands in the U.S. using Google Preferred has doubled year-over-year. Now, I want to spend time on our exciting Enterprise businesses, which have been gaining momentum. Last December, we have unified our cloud businesses under one leader, so we can innovate faster and better serve our customers. This decision is already paying off. Enterprises are starting to see the power of combining Google Cloud Platform with our suite of business applications, all of which are infused with our machine learning services. As companies accelerate their move to the cloud, we can help them automate their IT operations, better understand their data, and become more cost effective and secure, while also offering them transformative office productivity. In addition, we are helping customers adopt our powerful Chromebooks and Android phones. Our recent Next 2016 Conference in San Francisco showed just how serious we are about the enterprise. It was wonderful to hear executives from Spotify and Coca-Cola share their stories about how they are benefiting from Google's cloud technology, including our best-in-class security, reliability and analytics. We also introduced Cloud Machine Learning, which provides modern machine learning services with pre-trained models such as Cloud Vision API and Cloud Speech API. Our growth was accelerating going into that event, and since then, the quantity and quality of our enterprise conversations has risen to a whole new level. Now, we are investing and building our go-to-market activities to ensure we have the right expertise available for each of our business customers. We are enabling service partners to assist customers with everything from migrating to the cloud to using machine learning to understanding their data. We are providing engineering to help them architect solutions, and we building out our support teams. We are also helping businesses migrate to our suite of productivity applications like Gmail, Docs and Drive, and customers love them. And we continue to accelerate our innovation in this area with new announcements, such as Smart Reply and Voice Typing. It's gratifying to see the immensely positive response from our customers and partners, who recognize that we offer a powerful combination that's unique to Google : unmatched product innovation, combined with world-class security and reliability; technical transparency; and customer orientation. To close, as I said before, Google's mission is, and has always been, to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. As I think about all our businesses and each of the countries we reach, I have never been more excited about how our teams continue to bring this mission to life and make technology available for everyone. I've been so proud to see us expanding our core products to more and more countries around the world : Street View in Sri Lanka; YouTube in Nepal and Pakistan; new Hindu keyboards (27:58) in India; and a new engineering center in Singapore that will help us get closer to the next billion users coming online by developing products that will work well for them. We are laser-focused on our mission at Google, and I want to say thank you to all of the Googlers around the world who are helping us make it a reality each and every day. Before we take your questions, Ruth and I wanted to take a moment to pay our respects to Bill Campbell, our very close friend and a mentor to many of us at Google and Alphabet, who sadly passed on Monday. Bill spent endless hours with our founders and our leadership over the years, helping to build our Board of Directors and sustain our culture. He had a very big impact on our company, made us all smile, and inspired many great leaders of the valley. We offer our condolences to Bill's family, and we will miss him. And with that, I'll hand it back over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : We'll now turn it back to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open. Eric J. Sheridan: Thanks for taking the questions, maybe just two, one on YouTube; you've now played around with the idea of original content, also injected a subscription offering into the marketplace. What have you learned from the early days of original content and a subscription offering and how that might allow YouTube to evolve and change over time as a product offering? And second, with respect to the Advertising business, I was curious if there were any verticals or geographies that you might call out as either strengths or weaknesses in the Advertising business during Q1. Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Eric. On YouTube, we are definitely excited by the successful roll-out of YouTube Red. It's been very well received. We've really focused on our creators and partners, so hopefully you've caught some of our YouTube Originals. We have released six so far, which are available to YouTube Red members. So early indications are that this is something that's going to resonate well with users, and we are working on a lot more original content throughout the year. And we'll see how it goes. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of your question on the regions, as I tried to make clear in my opening comments, what we saw was real strength across the board. I think you could see that from the growth rates, with U.S. up 21% year-over-year, and that was really strength across products. UK, we're really pleased with the team. We continue to see great execution there. On a fixed FX basis, as I noted, up 21%. The biggest contributor to growth in the UK was Mobile Search. And then rest of world growing at 25% on a fixed basis. That's about in line with last quarter. We continue to be really pleased with the growth we're seeing there. In addition to the ongoing contribution from Mobile, the rest of world also benefited from Play and then really nothing to note with respect to verticals. Eric J. Sheridan: Thank you. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Carlos Kirjner-Neto: Hi. I have two quick questions, first on margins. Despite the increasing TAC as a percentage of revenues, adjusted operating income margins expanded now almost 130 bps and 140 bps for Google year-on-year. Can you help us understand, even if roughly, how much of this margin expansion is specific to the quarter, like due to FX, versus systemic or secular, so to speak? And the second question, I think maybe for Sundar, can you talk a bit about the decision you took last year to have an additional ad on Mobile Search response pages relegating organic results below the fold? How is it good for the user experience to have ad instead of organic? And if it is good, what does it say about the potential for innovation in organic search? Thank you. Ruth Porat : Thanks, Carlos. So starting on the margin question, you've hit a couple of the components, so I'm going to try and just break it down into the drivers on cost of sales versus OpEx more broadly, as you asked it. So on the cost of sales or the gross margin trend, as I tried to make clear, certain costs associated with revenue are going up, given secular trends in the market, so in Sites, Mobile carries higher TAC than does desktop and Mobile remains a strong growth driver, so we do expect this to continue. And then on the network side, we have strong growth in programmatic and that carries higher TAC than traditional ad buying. The obvious result is more revenue and gross margin dollars, but at a lower margin. And then on OpEx more broadly, we remain very committed to long-term revenue growth and profit. As we've talked about on prior calls, we did set priorities in the 2016 budget and we made some tough choices because our aim is to be as efficient and effective as possible with investment dollars, while properly funding the big opportunities that we have that are reflected in OpEx. So as I've repeatedly said, some of the biggest bets are in Google. Sundar commented quite a bit on cloud. That's an exciting opportunity. We want to continue to add head count to drive growth. And all of this is consistent with our goals of driving long-term growth in revenue and profit. So it goes to my opening comments that we're focused on controlling the expenses we have, and then there are certain trends, as I noted, in particular on the TAC side, that have been increasing with the strong growth we're seeing in mobile and programmatic. Sundar Pichai : And, Carlos, on the ad side, we are incredibly sensitive to the user experience on Search. And so we are constantly evolving how we display ads, but we take a very long-term view. Our ads quality efforts, these are people who have been working on this for many, many years and they are squarely focused on optimizing for positive metrics across users and advertisers. So our utmost focus is making sure, for users, these changes have a positive impact. And mobile is an entirely different paradigm and so a lot of things are counter-intuitive. So, for example, users are very comfortable swiping on mobile. So we deeply think about these things, and I'm very comfortable about how we are planning this for the very long-term. Carlos Kirjner-Neto: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ross Sandler : Thank you. Ruth, I just had one question, a follow-up from a previous one on the regions. So the U.S. had greater than expected seasonal downtick. It was down 9% quarter-on-quarter. And I know that you picked up Yahoo and lost AOL from 4Q to 1Q. So is that the primary driver of that or as YouTube becomes a bigger percent of your revenue, should we expect greater seasonal uptick in 4Q and seasonal downtick in 1Q? Can you just give us a little bit more color on what's driving that? Thanks. Ruth Porat : Well, we, as you know, don't comment on any particular partner. So all I can add here is that the deceleration quarter-on-quarter does reflect holiday-related seasonality, which we did call out last quarter, and you see that in a number of the products. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. You talked about TAC rising because of the increasing mix shift towards mobile and programmatic. There seems like there was a little bit of an extra bump up this quarter. Would there have been any one major renewal of a deal that would have caused that? It did seem to spike more than what you would get, I assume, if you just rolled out mobile and programmatic. And then any commentary at all on Nest; there seemed to be an unusual amount of press since intra-quarter on troubles with that asset? Could you just comment on qualitatively how the asset is doing? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So on TAC, it's really the ongoing growth in Mobile, as I've kind of answered a couple of times here, and that reflects the strong secular trends behind mobile, so really nothing to add on on the Sites TAC side. And then on the network side, again, it's really the higher TAC that we're seeing on programmatic, so nothing really to call out. And then with respect to your question on Nest, I guess what I'll add there is Nest products are best-sellers in the category. It's a leading brand in the connected home. It's obviously early, but a very exciting category. And as we've talked about, our Other Bets are all very early stage, but continues to be best-seller in the category. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you. This question is for Sundar. It's multi-part, but I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your cloud ambitions? And wondering what do you see as the biggest changes in strategy post Diane Greene's appointment? And then, how are you getting enterprise customers to think of you as having enterprise DNA, if you will, which is something that took Amazon a long time to get. And I guess lastly, just if you could just help us think about which type of workloads do you see Google as being the most competitive for at this time? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Heather. Obviously, I talked about it a lot in my prepared remarks. And we have already had a lot of momentum in this area. And in many ways, given the scale at which we have done this internally for us, we view it as an area we are very competent at. What Diane has brought to us to is a deep understanding of how to think about what enterprises need and adapt to it in a very detailed and nuanced way. And you saw the momentum at the Next Conference, which she hosted. We are getting a lot more inbound. We are in much deeper conversations than we have ever been before. We do think we are competent across a range of work flows. And areas where we view we will be uniquely capable over time is, because of our machine learning capabilities, helping enterprises really understand their data, understand how best they can do what their core competency is and really revolutionize around that. It's early days and it's a long-term investment. But bringing our machine learning APIs over time through cloud to our enterprise customers is going be a huge source of differentiation for us. Heather Bellini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Douglas T. Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. Two things; first, Sundar, I was hoping you could comment more on Mobile Search pricing, in particular it gets a little bit lost just within overall pricing per-click, especially with YouTube in there. So I was hoping you could comment on pricing on more of a like-for-like basis. And as inventory perhaps stabilizes some, would you expect pricing here to increase over time as conversion improves? And then secondly, Ruth, if you could just comment a little bit more on other income and just help us understand some of the details there on the negative number in that line? Thanks. Ruth Porat : So I'll take those. In terms of the first question, there's obviously some data, as I referenced, attached with the press release. And, as you know well, all of the monetization data reflects a host of factors, from geographic mix and device mix and property mix, as well as it's all on a floating FX basis. And clearly, FX is a contributor. I think you're trying to get more color on Mobile. And what's hopefully clear from the opening comments, is that Mobile continues to outperform. Desktop growth did pick up modestly in Q1, but, from opening comments, should be clear that Mobile Search revenue was up significantly. And then in terms of your question on other income, let me point you to the OI&E table that's at the end of our press release. This line consists of a number of different items. They can be affected by different trends, but you can see the breakout in that table, which hopefully is helpful there. Interest income has been fairly consistent. We do continue to manage our portfolio conservatively. FX is consistently an expense here. It was slightly elevated again this quarter, given the ongoing volatility in foreign exchange markets. We haven't changed our approach to hedging, but up with volatility in the markets. And then the OI&E line also includes changes in value where equity pickups related to marketable and nonmarketable securities and investments. We appreciate with all those different line items it's tough to forecast, but you can see the detail attached to the press release. Douglas T. Anmuth: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Steve D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Thank you. So, Sundar, I think it was at I/O last year when you started to call out the products which have over 1 billion users. At this point, are you able to elaborate on what percent of these users have either a Google ID or are known users for you? And, Ruth, kind of a housekeeping, I guess, item on the CapEx here. When you talk about CapEx with the Other Bets being primarily for Fiber, is this a fairly sort of straightforward passing of homes, or is your cash use going toward developing new technologies or products like SkyBender? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Steven, on the first question, maybe I can add more color this way. So user base is scaling most, you know, we are also seeing tremendous shift towards Mobile. It's in many of these products. We are already over 50% of these users are coming from Mobile. And in Mobile typically, all users are signed in. And so I think over time as the shift continues, I think we have a user base which is signed in. And so that's the way we think about it. Ruth Porat : And then on the CapEx question, if I just broaden that a bit, the CapEx trends in part is efficiency, in part is timing when you look at year-over-year spend. Compared to last year, we had some outsized machine spend that filled some recently constructed data centers. And as we've consistently said, our technical infrastructure is a really key strategic asset for us. We have tremendous scale. We continue to add to it, and the team has done an extraordinary job innovating to deliver some meaningful efficiencies in machine use. And that enables us to benefit from earlier investments. And although you asked about the Fiber side, just to build off of what Sundar was saying on cloud, given what a strategic priority that is for us, and the requirements for a leading cloud business are clearly at the core of all that we do and at a scale that's unmatched, given our sustained investments in infrastructure. One of the things that was also mentioned at Next is that we plan to add 12 new regions. And to be clear, we're going to be using multiple execution paths for those data center requirements. In other words, every cloud region isn't necessarily going to be housed in a Google data center. So we don't need to build data centers in all of these places. They will all incorporate the same Google hardware and software and meet the same performance, reliability and security requirements. And investing in cloud isn't only about CapEx. We also put a lot of head count behind that again this quarter. And then more specifically on the Fiber side, as you were pointing to, we do expect that to increase throughout the year as we execute on the cities that we've already announced. It's primarily about continuing to execute on those cities. We now are up to 22 announced cities, two most recent announcements being some buildings. We're bringing fiber to like buildings in San Francisco and we're working with the City of Huntsville. That being said, I liked your question because we're also very focused on innovation and technology. And so it's really both, but predominantly continued execution against these cities that we've announced. Steve D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Daniel Salmon : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Just a few questions on YouTube; first, on the Preferred program, Ruth, you mentioned it sounds like the growth continues to be really strong there going into Brandcast. And I was just curious, is the program now formally rolled out globally? And then I've got one follow-up on Red. Ruth Porat : So in terms of Preferred, you're right. I did note that the strong revenue growth there is driven virtually exclusively by video. That's TrueView and increasingly Google Preferred, and, as we said, nice ad (45:29) promotion there as well. Sundar Pichai : And it's largely rolled out in major markets and we'll continue to do that. Daniel Salmon : Okay, great. And then just a quick one on Red, it seems as if the direction for the content remains to focus on your own originals right now. What may or may not make you consider looking at other licensed, maybe more traditional, TV or film content? Sundar Pichai : Well, I mean, look, we are going to approach it comprehensively. And we have obviously had great early traction with the six original series we have released so far. This year, we are on track to release 15 to 20 original series or films coming up. (46:11) And so I think that's an exciting direction we will pursue, but, at the same time, we'll keep an open mind about all other revenues as well. Daniel Salmon : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. I have a few. First, for Sundar, could you talk about the cloud, why really get more aggressive now? We've been riding on it for many years, and just wondering why now really ramping up the investment? And how would you characterize the margins or the returns on capital in that business? Why is that interesting for you? And then maybe for Ruth, you know, you give us a lot of detail on click growth, but I'm just wondering if you can help us all on query growth, just how that's trended since Mobile really took off? Is it growing? How is it trending? And do you have more room to monetize, given where your ad coverage is now? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Just on the first one, I would say there are three points of inflection for us, and that's why we are really ramping it up. The first is we've always been doing cloud. It's just that we were consuming it all internally at Google, but as we have grown, really matured in terms of how we handle our data center investments and how we can do this at scale, we have definitely crossed over to the other side where we can thoughtfully serve external customers. So that's the first point of inflection. The second point of inflection for us is as we've been investing in machine learning and AI for years, but I think we are at an exceptionally interesting tipping point where these technologies are really taking off. And that is very, very applicable to businesses as well, and so thoughtfully doing that externally, we view as a big differentiator we have over others. And third, is definitely Diane Greene coming in. And I think I wanted to (48:12) scale our efforts here thoughtfully when it is set up with a great leader who understands this space deeply. And so those are the three main reasons why we are significantly ramping up what we are doing there. Ruth Porat : And then on query growth, we don't really talk about query growth. As Sundar said, focused on answers; there are a lot of new ways to search on mobile, of course, voice, et cetera. So let me try and actually add a little more on your question on cloud. We've consistently said it's early days. You asked about ROIC. We're really excited about the magnitude of the opportunity, as Sundar has talked about. And one thing that's really powerful here is we're benefiting from our heritage, from our differentiated strength, the scale of our infrastructure. Those are investments we've made over many years that give us extraordinary efficiency. We have robust security. Again, we've invested over many years. We have unparalleled machine learning. And so really, when we think through to the ROIC opportunity compelling building on investments that we've made and continue to make and a very exciting opportunity. Justin Post : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura. Your line is now open. Anthony DiClemente : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First, for Sundar on Google Fiber, just at a higher level, would you please broadly update us on your learnings from Google Fiber up until this point? And what are the goals that Google is trying to achieve with Google Fiber in terms of longer-term ambitions in terms of TV or video distribution? And then, Ruth, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, Mobile Search being driven by improvements in ad formats and delivery starting in the third quarter of last year. Is there any way to frame or think about what Sites revenue growth might be on a recurring basis if you try to exclude the impacts or benefits from the changes in formats that you mentioned and as we start to think about the year-over-year growth comparisons there for the back half of 2016? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So let me go ahead and start on the Fiber question. Fiber is one of the businesses that is in Other Bets. And like all of our access efforts, we're really focused. And our vision here is to create abundant and ubiquitous networks. We think there's a lot of opportunity to improve the experience that users have, and that's where the Fiber team is focused. And we have some other efforts within Other Bets that are really exciting as well that address access. Loon within our X business is targeting the 4 billion people still offline. And we view that similarly as a big opportunity and an important problem to address. And in terms of the early learnings, there have been a lot. As I talked about on the last quarter call, we've really continued to refine and enhance our go-to-market strategy, the way we're working with cities, the way we're building out those cities and really the level of technology and innovation that we can use to differentiate the offering and are pleased with the ongoing efforts there. And then in terms of the change in ad format, as we've talked about on a lot of calls, innovation is core to all we do. It obviously happens on its own timeline. We have a culture of it. We're continuously focused on it. I'm not going to break out impact for any change. We're constantly looking to innovate and improve the user experience. And so there was a step-up, which we've talked about, and we continue to look at other ways, as Sundar talked about, to continue to enhance the user experience. But I think the most important point and somewhat implicit in your question, that shouldn't take away from the very strong underlying revenue and revenue growth that we have in that business. Anthony DiClemente : Thank you, Ruth. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just on Mobile Search and the mobile ad format changes in 3Q of last year, could you just help us? Were those changes made globally last year in the third quarter? And if not, how should we think about when they will go globally or how you're kind of phasing those changes? And then, the second one on the desktop, Ruth, you mentioned that desktop growth picked up in the first quarter. What drove that pickup in growth and any learnings from the change in the right-hand rail in the first quarter? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : The launch which you're talking about was global. So we've been doing these changes for a long time and so we try to roll it out globally, and that's what we did. Ruth Porat : And then, in terms of the desktop format change, so we had a modest benefit from that change where, just to be clear for all, we reduced the ad load by removing ads on the right-side of the screen while adding a fourth ad slot for highly commercial queries in the aggregate. That resulted in a cleaner, more useful, presentation and improved user experience. It was a modest impact, but additive. Brian Nowak : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Your line is now open. Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Hi, guys, a few questions. Sundar, your commentary on Play focused on games, but what needs to happen to have more verticals beyond games become meaningful? And then, Ruth, a couple more on the Sites TAC, at a high level, how do average TAC rates differ on mobile versus desktop? And aside from the TAC rates, are there any other notable contractual issues that differ meaningfully between mobile and desktop search partnerships? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Yeah, Ben, on the first question, I think that's a good question. We are seeing traction across categories. It's just that games are at a much larger scale, but, for example, when we get into education, we see if you view that as a vertical, we do see traction there and so on. So I think taking a very long-term view, it will probably reflect they're all, there are commercial opportunities across every vertical. But game developers are the savviest developed person in terms of getting ahead of this curve. Ruth Porat : And on your TAC question, as I've indicated a number of times already on the call, the TAC rate is higher on Mobile. Mobile's growing at a faster rate and what you're seeing here is a mix shift. So there is a delta between the two. But I think, importantly, we are benefiting from an important secular trend behind Mobile, and like the revenue dollars and the gross profit dollars that come as a result of that, and we'll continue to innovate on mobile and are excited about the opportunity, in particular with all the changes that we continue to see in the way users use the phone and the opportunities. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Colin A. Sebastian: Okay, great. Thanks very much. Sundar, first off, you mentioned a lot of the ongoing projects at Google, but I wonder if you could share with us maybe the two or three areas that you're spending the most of your time on or are focused on? And related to that, one of the strengths of the company is obviously the strong engineering orientation and ability to hire some of the best talent and acquire the best technology. And the company has been able to adapt very quickly to change, but I wonder which areas of your business demonstrate where Google or Alphabet are really on the forefront of development, pushing innovation rather than adapting to changes you see in the market. Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Colin. On the first thing, obviously, we are doing many things, but I tend to spend my time on the core of, you know, our core product. I think we have a unique opportunity to evolve search to be very assistive in how we serve our users and be an intelligent assistant that helps users throughout their needs in context, especially in the context of mobile. That's an area definitely I spend a lot of time on. And related to that, we do think we can do a lot of that by based on our core advancements in machine learning and AI. So that's an area we invest a lot. And I'm thoughtfully involved with that as well. And third, definitely from a computing standpoint, computing is foundational to everything we do. And so thinking through about how computing evolves, be it emerging technologies like VR or how mobile advances over the next few years, so these are all areas where I do spend time on. And overall, I do think in the long run, I think we will evolve in computing from a mobile first to an AI first world. And I do think we are at the forefront of development. So we don't view it as adapting to it as much as pushing hard and getting there. And so that's the core of what we do, and we'll continue to do that. Colin A. Sebastian: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Ellen West for closing remarks. Ellen West : Thanks to everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2016 call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ellen West : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. While you've been waiting for the call to start, you've been listening to Aurora an incredible new artist from Norway who is finding a rapidly growing audience on YouTube all over the world. Now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website, located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now, I'll turn the call over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thanks, Ellen. Our revenue of $21.5 billion in the second quarter underscores the great performance of our businesses globally. For the quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 25% in constant currency versus last year. Once again, the primary driver was the increased use of Mobile Search by consumers, benefiting from our ongoing efforts to enhance the Mobile Search experience. We also benefited from solid growth in Desktop and Tablet Search as well as continued strength in YouTube and programmatic advertising. I'm going to present to you in the following order : first, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet; second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets; finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions. Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance, total revenue was $21.5 billion, up to 21% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $113 million, or $35 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 25% year-over-year and increased 5% sequentially. Once again, Alphabet revenues by geography highlight both the strength of our business around the globe as well as the impact the currency headwinds continue to have on our non-U.S. business relative to last year. U.S. revenue was up 25% year-over-year to $10 billion. UK revenue was up 14% year-over-year to $1.9 billion. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 20% year-over-year. These results do not reflect the movement in the British pound subsequent to the results of the referendum on June 23. Rest-of-world revenue was up 19% versus last year to $9.6 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 26% year-over-year. GAAP other cost of revenues were $4.2 billion. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.9 billion, up 28% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and hardware costs. GAAP operating expenses were $7.4 billion in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.2 billion, or 29% of revenue, up 15% year-over-year and up 2% versus Q1. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by R&D expense, mainly due to compensation expense related to head count growth. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $6 billion, up 24% versus last year. The operating margin was 28%. Non-GAAP operating income was $7.5 billion, up 25% versus last year. The operating margin was 35%. Stock-based compensation totaled $1.5 billion, up 33% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting increased head count and the impact of our senior executive equity refresh that occurs every two years. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 66,575, up 2,460 from last quarter. The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as cloud and apps. On a numbers basis, we are adding more head count in Google, while on a percentage basis, we are growing faster in Other Bets. Other income and expense was $151 million [income]. As discussed on prior calls, OI&E consists of a number of line items impacted by market factors, which makes it inherently unpredictable. We provide more detail on these line items in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 20%. Net income was $4.9 billion on a GAAP basis and $5.9 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7.00 on a GAAP basis and $8.42 on a non-GAAP basis. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $2.1 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google segment. Operating cash flow was $9.1 billion, with free cash flow of $7 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $78.5 billion, of which approximately $48 billion, or 61%, is held overseas. This performance reflects our strong operating cash flow, offset by the impact of our share repurchases during the quarter of approximately $1.6 billion, completing the authorization under our share repurchase program. Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment, revenue was $21.3 billion, up 21% year-over-year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $15.4 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. Year-on-year growth reflects substantial strength in Mobile Search due to the ongoing benefit from the improvement in ad format and delivery that we launched in the third quarter of last year. We continue to have solid growth from Desktop and Tablet Search. YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and increasingly Google Preferred, with a growing contribution from buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager. Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 3% year on year and up 1% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of programmatic offset by the traditional Network businesses. Other revenue for Google was $2.2 billion, up 33% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven by Cloud and Apps as well as Play, followed by hardware. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Let me remind you that these metrics are, of course, affected by currency movements. Total traffic acquisition costs were $4 billion, or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 18% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down slightly as a result of a mix shift between Sites revenue, which carries lower TAC, and Network revenue. The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue as well as Network TAC as a percentage of Network revenue reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely Mobile Search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Operating income excluding SBC was $8.3 billion, up 26% versus last year, for an operating margin of 39%. Google stock-based compensation totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 33% year-over-year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $7 billion, up 25% versus last year, and the operating margin was 33%. CapEx for the quarter was $2.1 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction. Turning to Other Bets financials, let me again emphasize that the majority of these efforts are pre-revenue. We continue to invest across these opportunities and are doing so in a disciplined way. We think it remains most instructive is to look at them over a longer time horizon because, as you have seen, quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy for three primary reasons. First, they are early-stage. Second, they represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries. And third, they may be impacted by one-time items like partnership deals. For the second quarter, Other Bets revenue was $185 million. Reported revenue for Other Bets was primarily generated by Nest, Fiber, and Verily. Operating loss excluding SBC was $709 million in the second quarter. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $859 million. Other Bets CapEx was $280 million in Q2, primarily reflecting ongoing investment in our Fiber business. I'd like to close with a few observations on our key themes. First, regarding revenue, our Alphabet structure, announced nearly a year ago, gives us the framework for developing new sources of revenue growth within both Google and in Other Bets in a disciplined way. You've seen over the past few quarters how our focus on innovation can drive strong revenue growth. We are continually working to enhance the search experience and making changes to our ads formats and tools, guided by substantial user testing. We have repeatedly highlighted the 3Q 2015 change in format given the meaningful step-up it drove in our revenue growth rate. That benefit is evident again in the second quarter. As we've always said, we have been and remain committed to long-term revenue growth through innovation, but the timing and scale of the impact of innovation is inherently difficult to predict. Second, as to expenses, I've commented many times that our focus on long-term revenue growth does not give us a pass on managing expenses. We invest a lot of time and effort in assessing how to manage for revenue growth with the utmost respect for the resources deployed and a focus on getting the best return on those resources, recognizing that in some areas secular trends are creating margin headwinds. As I mentioned last quarter, there are number factors driving higher TAC in both our Sites and Network businesses. For Sites TAC, there are a number of factors that contribute to fluctuations, in particular, changes in the relative use of mobile, desktop, and tablet devices. For each of these devices, Sites TAC also reflects an interrelated set of factors, including the mix of paid versus organic distribution points, partners, and agreement terms. Over the past year, the shift to mobile has been the primary driver of the increase in Sites TAC because more mobile searches are subject to TAC. When looking at Sites TAC as a percentage of revenue, it's important also to remember that while YouTube advertising revenue is reflected in our Sites line, the associated content acquisition costs are included in other cost of revenues, not TAC. In addition, Sites revenue includes hedging gains with no associated effect on TAC. The growth in Network TAC is due to the ongoing adoption of programmatic platforms by advertisers, which are subject to a higher TAC rate. In operating expenses, people are our biggest area of investment. We continue to attract, develop, and retain the best people to drive our businesses forward. As you would expect, head count additions primarily align with our priority areas, such as cloud and apps and machine learning. Two important points regarding the third quarter; first, you will see the impact in the third quarter of our annual equity refresh for our employees. As you have seen in prior years, the annual refresh results in a sequential step-up in SBC. Second, head count growth tends to be seasonally high in Q3 because that is when we bring on new graduates. In addition, please keep in mind that our marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back half of the year due to the holiday season. Third, regarding CapEx, at Google the team has been able to drive meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure, which has enabled us to support growing demand at a stable investment level. These efficiencies include improvements in power and server utilization, the use of machine learning, and deployment of innovations like our Tensor Processing Unit. With regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, our Fiber investment continues to be the driver. Fourth, about our balance sheet, we remain focused on optimizing our capital structure, recognizing the strategic value of our balance sheet. We completed Alphabet's $1.7 billion debt exchange in the second quarter, which gives us flexibility, including the ability to use debt financing if appropriate. In light of the interest rate environment, we may opportunistically access the market to term out our commercial paper. In conclusion, in the second quarter we delivered very strong revenue growth and improved operating efficiency. These results reflect the tremendous talent and hard work of our teams around the globe. I will now turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Ruth. As you heard, we had a very strong second quarter. There's an amazing energy right now at Google. The strength of the quarter is about Mobile. It's transformed the way that people consume information, and Google's products have become a central and much-loved part of their experience. Our investment in Mobile now underlines everything that we do today, from Search and YouTube to Android and advertising. Mobile is the engine that drives our present. And now to our deep investments in machine learning and AI, we are building the engine that will drive our future. Since the last earnings call, we had Google I/O, our biggest event of the year, and I also wrote our annual Founders' Letter. Both of these allowed me to reflect on our past and look to our future. We are at a pivotal and transformational moment. Thanks to advancements in machine learning, we have the unique opportunity to take a big step forward for the next 10 years. In the letter, I wrote about how we think of our investments and our mission. Today, I'll walk through the six sections of the Founders' Letter and discuss our progress in each area. And then I'll call out three key highlights from the quarter that are driving our advertising business today and into the future. The first thing I highlighted in the Founders' Letter was information. At Google's core, we remain focused on making information and knowledge available for everyone. This of course starts with Search, where we now have trillions of searches every year. We continue to invest in making Search smarter and more useful. In the U.S., we recently introduced a voter tool, so when you search to register to vote, you will get a detailed state-by-state guide with information on how to register, requirements, and deadlines. Our new keyboard for iOS, called Gboard, is off to a great start. People love the ability to easily search right from the keyboard, swipe to type, and quickly send emojis. And after just one year, Google Photos is now helping over 200 million people every month organize and search their photos and memories. At I/O, I was excited to share our vision around the Google Assistant. We want to help people get things done in a conversational way across devices and context. This is possible thanks to advances in machine learning, voice and image recognition, and natural language processing, which we have invested in for years. You will be able to experience the Google Assistant in products like our new messaging app, Allo, and our voice-activated device, Google Home, and we can't wait to show you what else we are working on in this area. Second, machine learning; as I said, machine learning is the engine that will drive our future, and it's already making our products better and helping users every day. In fact, more than 100 teams are currently using machine learning at Google, from Street View to Gmail to Voice Search and more. For example, in Search, we use a ranking signal called RankBrain, which relies on deep learning to improve results. It's already enhancing the search experience in 40 languages. And based on user testing, RankBrain can accurately guess which results users will favor with about 80% accuracy. Advances like this help us make our search results even more relevant. Machine learning is also creating an impact in other ways. Just last week, we announced a test that applied DeepMind's machine learning to our own Google data centers, resulting in up to a 40% reduction in the energy we use for cooling. This will greatly improve efficiency. And when we publish our research, we hope it will enable others to reduce emissions, too. Third, content; a big part of making information available is making great content accessible, such as on Google Play, YouTube, and the web. Our efforts to make the mobile web better for everyone with Accelerated Mobile Pages, or AMP, has seen phenomenal global momentum. We now have over 150 million AMP pages in our index and with over 4 million new ones published every week from nearly 200 countries. Last week, we announced AMP for Ads, which helps advertisers build fast, simple, and beautiful ads and landing pages. This will help make the mobile web experience much faster for everyone and help fund it more sustainably. Video is a huge component of digital content, and YouTube continues to shine. It's a thriving home for creators, with more than 1,000 creators crossing the 1,000 subscribers mark every single day. Our content diary (20:25) system has now paid out over $2 billion to partners who use the system. A big part of video, of course, is live, which we have invested in since 2011. YouTube is the first major platform that supports live content in 360 degrees, and we recently announced the ability for creators to go live from their phones with the touch of a button. Earlier in the quarter, we teamed up with BT to livestream the Champions League and Europa League finals on YouTube in the UK. This special event was UK's biggest-ever livestream. All these innovations are a big reason why partner revenue has averaged 50% growth over the last three years. Fourth, platforms; a key focus is building great computing platforms like Chrome, Android, and our new virtual reality platform, Daydream, so that people can have wonderful experiences regardless of the device or stream they are using. Platforms are what make new computing experiences possible and also power breakout hits like Pok\u00e9mon Go, which I suspect a few of you are playing right now. Android is thriving. In the last year alone, we have delivered over 65 billion app installs and are helping developers reach an audience of over 1 billion users every single month. Our partners are also seeing incredible successes with flagship devices like the Samsung Galaxy S7. It's a hit with consumers and a shining example of how to build a great experience on Android. Our latest version of Android, called Nougat, focuses on performance, productivity, and security. And it also has a VR mode built in to help developers create immersive smartphone VR experiences. Speaking of VR, we are already working with leading Android partners to build out the Daydream ecosystem, so stay tuned for more Daydream-ready phones, controllers, and headsets coming this fall. Fifth, cloud; many tremendous digital experiences are being built in the cloud today, and businesses are working to take advantage of the cloud as part of their digital transformation. We've been integrating our cloud and apps products to create more unified solutions for companies large and small, and these efforts are paying off. We have strong momentum with businesses like Symphony, a secular communication and workflow platform, who recently announced that its cloud computing business is available on the Google Cloud Platform [GCP]. We provide the high reliability and performance needed by Symphony's customers in the financial services industry. Our data analytics product, BigQuery, helps mobile gaming company, Kabam, store and understand player actions within their games, from monetization and fraud to production bugs and level completion statistics. As I've said, machine learning has been a major focus and a key differentiator for Google, and that's true for our Google Cloud customers as well. This quarter, we introduced Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which can deliver an order of magnitude better optimized performance per watt for machine learning projects. Google DeepMind's AlphaGo was powered by TPUs, enabling it to process faster and look farther ahead between moves. We are now passing this benefit on to our enterprise customers to supercharge their machine learning applications. Just last week, we introduced two cloud machine learning APIs for speech and natural language to help our enterprise customers convert audio to text and easily understand the structure and sentiment of the text in a variety of languages. We also introduced a new undersea cable system, the highest capacity system ever built, which brings added capacity and performance to support our enterprise customers around the globe. This system has 60 terabytes per second of total capacity, more than any active undersea cable and is 10 million times faster than your cable modem. This is especially exciting as we prepare to launch a new Google Cloud Platform, East Asia region, in Tokyo later this year. In addition to building the best products and infrastructure, we are also hard at work building the best team to serve every aspect of our customers' businesses. We now have key leadership in place and centralized teams supporting customer-facing activities, including sales, marketing, global alliances, industry solutions, and professional services. We are building out our support at full scale as more and more Fortune 100 companies choose our cloud. Sixth, building for everyone; since the Internet is one of the world's most powerful equalizers, we are committed to building technology and making information available for everyone, wherever they are. This has always been core to Google's DNA. As we have shared before, we are working with Indian Railways and RailTel to bring high-speed wireless access to the entire Internet to millions of people who travel throughout India's top railway stations. There are already 2 million people logging in every month, and they are using as much as 15 times the data they would otherwise use in a full day on their cellular networks. We are also working hard to ensure that our products work well for everyone, regardless of where they live. We've been expanding better carrier building (25:55) in Google Play with more than 100 partners in 40 countries. To give you a sense of the impact, in Indonesia alone, we have seen growth in monthly buyers quadruple in the last 18 months. Switching gears from these six areas, it's our business success that enables us and our partners to grow and invest further. We are extraordinarily well positioned to take advantage of the mobile shift, and we are already seeing strong growth in three key areas of our advertising business, Mobile Search, Video, and Programmatic. All of the momentum you're seeing is because our products are doing well in Mobile and our customers are getting great results from them. We offer advertisers and agencies the best ways to reach customers at the right moment of intent, the best reach in inventory, the best mobile formats, and the leading measurement solutions. And of course, we do all of this while making sure we are creating a great ads experience for users that's helpful and unobtrusive. We know that people are constantly searching for things with commercial intent and are used to swiping and tapping. Our data shows that people respond really well to that, as we show. They are fresh, fast, and useful. So let me turn to three key moments from the quarter for our advertising business, number one, our Google Performance Summit for direct response marketers. We announced new Expanded Text Ads and bid adjustments by device type, which are rolling out this week, as well as new local search ads in Google Maps. Thanks to the rise of mobile phones, the line between online and offline experiences continues to blur. This creates even greater opportunity for businesses to use Google Maps to help bring customers into their physical store locations. Thanks to our strong intent signals, particularly on mobile, Google continues to offer great opportunities for direct response marketers to reach potential customers, whether they are visiting your website, calling your business, walking into your store, or downloading your app. For instance, Walgreens partnered closely with Google to promote their app across Search, Google Play, and our Display Networks. In one month, they increased the number of app downloads 87% from the previous month. Number two, our annual Brandcast event for brand advertisers was a huge success. We announced breakout videos. The ability to advertise against fast-rising videos on YouTube as well as a deal with the NBA to bring their inventory to Google Preferred. At this point, the volume of Google Preferred bought this year is already more than double what it was at the same time last year. Fast food chain Wendy's used Google Preferred to extend the reach of their TV ads. And thanks to our Brand Lift measurement solution, they were able to see that one of their campaigns drove an incredible 65% lift in ad recall and 146% lift in Google searches for the Wendy's brand. We are hearing a lot of the same feedback from many top brands who continue to invest more and more of their budgets on YouTube. And number three, our DoubleClick Leadership Summit, held just last week for ad technology partners. We launched the ability to buy native ads programmatically across all screens in DoubleClick Bid Manager. Since we're providing fully designed creatives for each publisher, advertisers can simply upload the contents of the ad like headline, image, and text, and DoubleClick automatically assembles them to fit the context and format of the site or app where they appear. Making native advertising simple at this scale will help to make ads faster, better, and less intrusive while driving great returns for publishers. So there are my top three moments from our Advertising business this quarter. As you can see, it's been extremely busy. More generally, from advertising, to cloud, to digital content, to hardware, and to so much more, we have tremendous long-term growth opportunities at Google. Today's great innovations are being driven by investments in Mobile. Tomorrow's will be driven from our investments in machine learning and new computing platforms. But one thing is constant. We'll continue to focus on building the best experiences for billions of people around the world. I want to thank all the Googlers around the world who help us create these opportunities every day and help bring them to life for our users and partners. With that, I will turn it back over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Sundar. We will now take your questions. Operator : And our first question comes from Carlos Kirjner of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Carlos Kirjner-Neto: Thank you. I have two questions. First is about Search revenues. Search is probably a $50 billion business, and from today's results it's clearly still growing strongly. Of course, as the business gets larger, it becomes harder and harder to sustain growth. As you look at this increasing growth challenge on your product innovations in Search, including the recent changes and also those that you have in your roadmap for the next few years, how do you think about your ability to sustain such revenues growth and the trajectory over which they will ultimately decelerate? The second question is on Google Fiber. I think Ruth has been quite clear that we should expect an increase in Other Bets CapEx and that Fiber is the main driver, suggesting more investment. Yet, when we see the rate at which you will have deployed in markets like Austin and some of the newer markets, they are quite slow. You also have started to talk about wireless technology, suggesting that you haven't fully figured this out yet, which in turn suggests that it's going to be slow deployment. So the question is, which one is it? Is it faster, more aggressive deployment given the CapEx commentary, or is it going to be continuous slow multiyear deployment as your track record and the talk of new technologies suggest? Thank you. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Carlos, a lot in those questions. So starting with Sites revenue and where we see the opportunities there, obviously Sites revenue up 24% year on year includes the currency impact. And as Sundar and I both commented on, the biggest driver again this quarter was Mobile Search. We do continue to have solid growth in Desktop, Tablet. And we have strength in YouTube, particularly video advertising, both in our TrueView product and increasingly from Google Preferred. As we've talked about every quarter since the third quarter of last year, we have benefited from the change to ad formats on Mobile that we made in third quarter of last year, and that is evident yet again this quarter. Then, as per your question, going back to that third quarter of 2015 when we made the change in ad formats on Mobile, our growth rate meaningfully accelerated. And as we've noted in each subsequent quarter, that change has been the primary driver of the higher year-on-year revenue growth rate. But importantly, as you've seen over the last several quarters, we're benefiting not just from the higher growth rate but also from the durability of the impact of the change. So that's really underscoring the efficacy of these ads for users, as per Sundar's comments, and it's reflected in revenues running at a higher level. And you can see where the revenue growth rate was prior to the third quarter introduction. I'll let you do your own forecasting, but when comparing growth rates, we're obviously at a higher revenue base versus last year. And then Sundar talked about some of the recent events that we've had. Innovation is core to everything we're doing. We've launched several changes to ad formats and tools just a few days ago. As the team discussed at the Google Performance Summit, we believe the changes should result in a better, more useful experience for users and better performance for advertisers. And so that just continues to be core to the way we're looking at the business with a lot of incremental opportunity. And then on your Fiber and CapEx question, look, we continue to see Fiber as a huge market opportunity. We're focused on creating abundant connectivity on networks that are always fast and always open, as we've talked about, and we're continuing to work closely with cities given their excitement. We're also continuing to push the frontier with tech innovation, as you noted in your question, and different execution paths. So as you said in the question, we're exploring both Fiber and wireless, and you may have seen our recent acquisition of Webpass. So we want to make sure we're executing against a very large and attractive market in the most effective and efficient manner. We did start adding customers in Charlotte in July. And so again, we view it as a big opportunity. We're being thoughtful and deliberate in our execution path. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open. Eric J. Sheridan: Thank you so much for taking the questions. Maybe following up on Carlos, his question on Search, and Ruth, your answer, I wanted to go a little bit deeper on the retail and the travel verticals. It's two areas where we see a lot of innovation from the company right now, both on the product side that consumers are seeing as well as on the advertising side. How should we think about the roadmap ahead for both increased user engagement with your product in those key verticals as well as the ability for advertiser conversion to lead to more advertising budgets for the company over the medium to long term? And then maybe one second question would be, with the buyback authorization having been completed this quarter, Ruth, I would love to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about the balance sheet as an asset and how shareholders should think about the ability for shareholder returns over the medium and long term. Thank you so much. Ruth Porat : Okay, so why don't I start on your second question? Then I'll pass it to Sundar on the first question. So as you know, we announced the share repurchase program relatively recently. It was just in the third quarter of last year, and we just completed it as per my opening comments. As we discussed back in the third quarter, we do always review our balance sheet and capital requirements and opportunities with our board, and I'm not going to speculate about a potential for a future board decision, so really nothing more to add at this point. And then, Sundar? Sundar Pichai : Look, we obviously think generally across all types of verticals, and you highlighted a couple of important verticals. To give an example on travel, many users start their travel inquiry on Google. And so we focus on doing a better job of getting them deeper information, new destinations, and compare costs through new features in Hotel Search [Hotel Finder], Google Flights, and the recently launched Destinations on Google. In all of this, we work closely with many different partners, including online travel agencies, and so we focus on product enhancements in partnership with them. And the better job we do at answering user queries, the more qualified leads we can provide to our partners, and we think it's win-win arrangement. And the same concept applies for these other verticals as well. So we approach it very holistically. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Thank you very much. Sundar, I was wondering. I know you gave us some color on the Cloud business just a few moments ago in your prepared remarks. But I was wondering if you could share with us some of the changes, if you could highlight some of them that Diane [Greene] has made since she's come onboard. And I'm wondering how some of those changes might be starting to impact conversations with potential customers that you're having. In particular, I'm just trying to get a sense of, are you seeing Google now with GCP getting invited to more RFPs and starting to see your win rates go up as a result of some of her initiatives? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Heather. Absolutely, I think Diane has initiated a set of changes, and essentially she has integrated our go-to-market strategy with our engineering and product efforts. She has integrated our engineering efforts on the cloud. So for example, Google Apps, Drive, Docs, Gmail, Slides, Sheets, Hangouts, et cetera, is on top the cloud stack. Our enterprise customers and partners for them, now they have one enterprise face and internally from frictionless contracts to touch points across Google, to one person to work with them on our considerable enterprise technologies and products, so the big unifying one being Cloud. We now have new leadership in place across sales, professional services, marketing, and partnering plus new customer facing support in the form of professional services. We have an office of the CTO and customer reliability. So it's a big set of changes, and it's obviously having an impact. Many of our customers are also partners since it's increasingly clear how much we can do together. So for me, I see a shift to a world-class enterprise approach, and it's definitely having an impact on the type of conversations we are having and the outcome of the RFPs we are engaged in. Heather Bellini : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ross Sandler : Great. Sundar, I just had a question about machine learning. So you spent a lot of time talking about how this is positively impacting Google as a whole and how you're building for the future, both tonight and at I/O a few months ago. And you guys have mentioned things like reducing the error rates in Search and improving relevancy. But are there tangible examples of either engagement or volume also increasing as you roll out machine learning in Search and in YouTube that you could share? And then, I think Google recently introduced Smart Bidding in AdWords using machine learning. So do you see something like this as a potential revenue driver? Any color there would be great. Thank you. Sundar Pichai : So we definitely \u2013 a core part of improving the user experience for the next many years will be driven by machine learning. To give a specific example, you asked about YouTube. YouTube watch time is something we focus on. We use machine learning increasingly to give recommendations to users. So when they're watching a video in terms of what they could watch next, and that recommendation system is increasingly using machine learning, and that directly drives engagement. So there are several such examples I can give across the company. You mentioned AdWords, too. If you look at AdWords and the thoughtful changes we do, over time, we are dealing with paid commentarial space in terms of the kinds of changes and interactions that can happen. So deploying machine learning there over time, over many years, I think is a more powerful and deeper way to explore the various possibilities that exist and I think will lead to long-term impacts. And so I'm very optimistic on it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Douglas T. Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask two. First, Sundar, you talked about Expanded Text Ads. And my question is just as the number of characters here increases somewhat, say, up to 50% through Expanded Text Ads, you're taking up more space on the page. How do you balance the higher percentage of clicks from these paid ads with the natural search experience? And then secondly, on YouTube, do you think you're taking share of TV dollars currently? And if not, what's needed to do that going forward? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : On the first one, we obviously, over many, many years, we always put users first. And as we present our search results, we have long-term metrics for user happiness around which we make, that's the framework for all the changes we make. Obviously, with the shift to mobile, the user experience, users are evolving in terms of how they use our product. And with that as a guidance, we have made changes. We make many, many changes and I would look at it holistically. And even some of the changes you're talking about affect certain highly commercial queries, where users are actually looking for that commercial information. So the metrics is what drives how we change these things, and I'm being very, very thoughtful about it. But we always step back and make sure the overall load, et cetera, is really working for users. And I'm pretty comfortable with how we are approaching it. On YouTube, I think about it as we are seeing strong growth. I mentioned the momentum behind Google Preferred and how we are double the rate we were last year. So to me, that implies strong growth. It's tough for us to assess whether it's from TV or just advertisers investing more because there's traction in YouTube, but we just see strong momentum. And as far as today, when I just look at how users are using mobile, video is the killer app, killer format on mobile, and I think that's what gives us the secular trend moving forward. Douglas T. Anmuth: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. I just want to ask one question and it has to do with Mobile Search. And I want to throw an idea by you, which is we've been going through this mobile transition for four or five years. Consumers have I think dramatically led businesses and advertisers to mobile devices. I'm wondering if what you're now seeing is finally, as e-commerce and travel and other commerce activities have really become critical and material on mobile devices, you're finally starting to see ad budgets really shift over and you're starting to get auction dynamics start to pick up in Mobile Search. So could you just comment on whether you're finally seeing this kind of backswing for advertisers to engage with Mobile Search in a way that you really hadn't seen before; it just took that many years for this to happen? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Mark, thanks for the question. I would say at a higher level, this is a scale business. And you're right, as we have had this shift to mobile, there are second-order effects which kick in too, which is why when you look at our ad improvements and our revenue improvements, I would focus more holistically. We do deeper changes across the board, not just visible changes on the page, and all of that contributes to it. So I do definitely think as the shift to mobile accelerates, we are getting some scale benefits, and that's part of it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO. Your line is now open. Daniel Salmon : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, I was wondering if you could spend a little time talking about the launch of the My Activity site, which I think is an update to the controls that your users have over the use of their data. And, in particular, I'd be interested to hear about the option to opt into greater personalization of ads from across the usership on Google Sites, as I believe that's the first time you've allowed, on an opt-in basis certainly, to have search data be used to target ads elsewhere. And then maybe as a follow-up to that, what you're seeing in terms of early traction of users turning that on and where your expectations for that may be. Sundar Pichai : Look, we are very focused on giving users better controls, and so we wanted to give users a single place to see and control ad settings. And that will be honored as the user moves across devices. It's completely opt-in. Users are absolutely in control. Consumers and advertisers have come to expect ads to work better across devices, and this new option could help us better deliver on that. So for people who choose to opt in, over time we could make sure they see more relevant ads and fewer annoying ones, so effectively put them in better control of the experience they get, and so I think that helps the whole ecosystem work better. We are in very, very early days, but we're being thoughtful about how we do this for users. Daniel Salmon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Colin A. Sebastian: Great, thanks. I guess two quick questions. First off, we understand that Google Shopping in particular continues to see strong growth, and I was hoping you could add some color on the relative mix or growth rates of TLA [Text Link Ads] contrasting to other ad types along with the adoption of transactional capabilities. And then, Sundar, I wanted to follow up on some of the conversational voice applications and devices that you have in the pipeline, and more generally how you envision voice really fitting in across the board, across the Google platform. Will this be a centerpiece as you also utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence? I'd like to hear more about your vision for that. Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Let me quickly \u2013 on the first one, we don't comment on the relative mix, et cetera, so I'll probably give more color on your second question. Voice is obviously very, very exciting for us. I mentioned this at I/O. if you look at Android, the Google app on Android in the U.S., 20% of the queries are voice queries. So today in terms of evolving to a conversational assistant, we have a big head start. People do this. We get millions of queries every single day. And it's incredibly exciting to see how people interact with voice differently from text. It's more intuitive. It's more personal, and it's a bit more emotional and an engaging experience for users. And so I think to do this well requires deep computer science, just understanding what they are saying, the natural language processing involved. These are areas in which we have now been working for over 15 years, and we believe we are the best in class. And so bringing all of that together I think is what will help us do this at scale globally, but it's still very early days in terms of getting the conversational assistant right. You will see us launch this through our products as we go through the second half of this year, and I'm excited to see how users respond to it. Colin A. Sebastian: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura. Your line is now open. Anthony DiClemente : Great, thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, in terms of messaging, you mentioned Allo, your mobile messaging product, and Duo, which is your video messaging product. Why is it important that Google is competitive in mobile messaging? And what gives you the confidence that you could take market share from the other players in the messaging space? And then, Ruth, in terms of the drivers of YouTube growth, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that one of the drivers was buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager. I just want to maybe hear a little bit more about that. Why has that been so successful recently, and do you look at that as an incremental forward driver of YouTube revenue growth? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On your first question, I think messaging is obviously an important area. We approach these areas if you believe we have insights by which we can create something very differentiated for users, that we are actually approaching it in a new and unique way. The core underlying insight we have is, in the context of mobile and using state-of-the-art machine learning, can we rethink some of the areas for our users? So that's the underlying framework with which we have approached this space of being really enjoying using these products, and we'll get it out to users soon. For example, I think if you take something like Duo today, I think especially on Android, high-quality messaging is an experience that's still lacking for users, so we clearly see an opportunity there. And it's at the core of our mission, bringing information experiences to users. And so that's why we are investing and we are optimistic about this space. Ruth Porat : And I think on the other part of your question, I think the key point is we've talking about programmatic for quite some time. We're just seeing strong momentum across the board, and we continue to benefit from that. Anthony DiClemente : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Your line is now open. Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Sundar, can you broadly discuss the Google hardware strategy and perhaps some of the lessons learned from previous Google hardware launches? And then relatedly, can you just discuss a little bit about how you're thinking the auto strategy? Do you build your own vehicles, license technology? How do you determine which direction to take there and how long until we might see any auto-related revenue? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : On our overall hardware strategy, we've always, we have done devices like Nexus or Google Pixel, et cetera. We realize a lot of computing innovations happen at the intersection of hardware and software. And as we are building ecosystems and broad platforms, we need a way to drive them forward. And so that's the context in which we do. There are areas where we have done it very seriously. Chromecast is a great example. We now have over 30 million Chromecast devices sold, and that's an example of where we invest deeply. And especially as newer areas emerge like Google Home, we want our ability to put the best experience possible in front of our users and guide the ecosystem. So that's how we think about it. We are being much more thoughtful in how we approach it, and we're building a world-class team so that we can do this for our users. But we are very thoughtful about how we approach it, and we make sure to work with the ecosystem to accomplish what we are trying to do. Ruth Porat : And then on cars, self-driving cars is in our Other Bets area, so just a brief update there. We're now testing in four cities, Mountain View, Austin. Most recently we expanded to Kirkland, Washington and to Phoenix. We've self-driven over 1.6 million miles. And the focus here for us is we're solving a really big need, safety, access, and city efficiency. The other thing that's really motivating for us is when you look at over 30,000 car deaths in the U.S. alone, that's what really inspired the founders to start working on this issue. And our approach is quite different from most others. We're focused on fully-autonomous cars because in early testing we saw the risk of depending on drivers to remain engaged once you give them the option to switch off. So we've invested a lot there. We're testing extensively based on this approach. And more specifically to your question, we're pleased to be working with FCA to advance the development of the self-driving cars. With them, we're more than doubling the number of cars that we have, but we do have huge respect for the expertise required, so we do expect we'll work with many partners in this area. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Thank you, a couple questions. First on YouTube, just thinking about premium content, a lot of activity with streaming deals out there. Obviously, YouTube would be a natural place for streaming content, but even professionally developed content. Do you think you're letting an opportunity get by? How do you think about that? And then, Ruth, I know you had a lot of experience dealing with regulatory agencies in your last CFO role. There have been some new filings. Can you talk at all about how Google is thinking about that right now? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So I'll start on the second question. Look, we continue to work constructively with regulators. We don't have an update on timing on any of those specific issues. But the main points in our view are that regulators have found that our businesses do help consumers. And the key mantra here is if we do the right thing for the user, all else will follow. With respect to consumers, we continue to invest in innovative opportunities that create great experiences and improve their lives. And we're empowering small businesses globally by providing greater reach to customers, not just in their towns, but across countries and around the world. And in our discussions, one of the very important points is we operate in a very vibrant, competitive environment, and we're also proud of the fact that we're investing meaningfully in the ecosystem. For example, Android has helped foster a remarkable and sustainable ecosystem of manufacturers and app developers and entrepreneurs based on open source software and open innovation. That's really the thrust of it, and the emphasis is we're continuing to work constructively with regulators, no additional update. Sundar Pichai : And, Justin, on the livestreaming question, I already mentioned that livestream is a big focus for us. We've been at it for a while, and we've built a great, robust, and mature platform for big events. We just announced at VidCon our plans to make mobile livestreaming features available within our core YouTube app on all mobile devices. Our stream time, livestream time has increased 3x since the beginning of the year alone. And YouTube is the first major platform to support live content in 360 degrees. And recent examples, even the RNC in the DNC conventions, they have been livestreamed on YouTube in 360. So there's a lot of momentum there and we are absolutely committed to this space. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the U.S. It accelerated pretty nicely. Any specific buckets of advertisers or any of the innovative products that you'd call out as driving that acceleration in the quarter? And the second one, Sundar, you talked about using machine learning for better suggestions on YouTube. Can you help us all think about what the level of engagement is on YouTube right now, whether it's minutes or maybe growth in images? How do we think about engagement on YouTube now? Thanks. Ruth Porat : So in terms of the U.S., the 25% year-on-year growth reflects strength across products. There's really nothing to call out. It's modest acceleration consistent with what we saw overall, but it's really about Mobile Search. Sundar Pichai : On YouTube, at a high level I would say we don't have any new metrics. But on mobile alone, as I've said before, we reach more 18-to-34 and 18-to-49s than any other TV network, broadcast or cable. And every indication we see is that the growth is very, very strong, being driven by mobile, and it's growing globally as well. So overall, I think engagement is very, very healthy. I'm pretty excited about it. Brian Nowak : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ellen West for closing remarks. Ellen West : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2016 call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West (0:33), Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Unverified Participant : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. While you've been waiting for the call to start, you've been listening to Dua Lipa, a rising new pop star from London, whose most recent single on YouTube has found fans all over the world and cracked the top 40 in the U.S. ahead of her debut album release early next year. Now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2015 filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Ellen (2:06). Our revenue of $22.5 billion in the third quarter underscores the terrific performance of our businesses globally. For the quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 23% in constant currency versus last year, notwithstanding a challenging year-on-year comparison. Once again, the primary driver was Mobile Search, with ongoing strength in YouTube and important contributions from programmatic advertising and Play. I'm going to present to you in the following order. First, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions. Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance, total revenue was $22.5 billion, up 20% year over year and up 4% sequentially. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year over year of $196 million or $91 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 23% year over year and increased 5% sequentially. Alphabet revenues by geography highlight the strength of our business around the globe. U.S. revenue was up 22% year over year to $10.6 billion. UK revenue was up 5% year over year to $1.9 billion, reflecting the meaningful impact of the decline in the British pound relative to last year. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 18% year over year. Rest-of-world revenue was up 22% versus last year to $9.9 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 25% year over year. GAAP other cost of revenues was $4.5 billion, up 30% year over year. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $4.2 billion, up 29% year over year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube. GAAP operating expenses were $8 billion in the quarter, up 15% year over year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.5 billion, up 13% year over year. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $5.8 billion, up 22% versus last year. The operating margin was 26%. Non-GAAP operating income was $7.6 billion, up 24% versus last year. The operating margin was 34%. Stock-based compensation [SBC] totaled $1.9 billion, up 30% year over year and up 24% sequentially, primarily reflecting the step-up from our annual equity refresh for employees at the start of Q3. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 69,953, up 3,378 people from last quarter. Headcount growth is typically seasonally highest in the third quarter as new graduates join. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as cloud. Other income and expense was $278 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 16%. Net income was $5.1 billion on a GAAP basis and $6.3 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7.25 on a GAAP basis and $9.06 on a non-GAAP basis. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $2.6 billion, the substantial majority of which supported the Google segment. Operating cash flow was $9.8 billion, with free cash flow of $7.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $83.1 billion, of which approximately $50 billion or 60% is held overseas. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenue was $22.3 billion, up 20% year over year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $16.1 billion in the quarter, up 23% year over year and up 4% sequentially. Year-on-year growth reflects strength in Mobile Search. We continue to have decent growth from desktop and tablet search. YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView, with a growing contribution from buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager. Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 1% year on year and flat sequentially, reflecting the ongoing strong growth of programmatic and AdMob, offset by the traditional network businesses. Other revenue for Google was $2.4 billion, up 39% year over year and up 12% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven by Play and Cloud. Finally, we provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Let me remind you that these metrics are affected by currency movements. Total traffic acquisition costs [TAC] were $4.2 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 17% year over year and up 5% sequentially. The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenue reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely Mobile Search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up slightly sequentially as a result of higher TAC for Mobile Search offsetting the benefits of a revenue mix shift from network to Sites. Operating income excluding SBC was $8.4 billion, up 19% versus last year, for an operating margin of 38%. Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.6 billion for the quarter, up 28% year over year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $6.8 billion, up 17% versus last year, and the operating margin was 30%. CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction. Turning to Other Bets, as we said previously, we think it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon because, as you have seen, quarterly revenues and expenses can be lumpy for three primary reasons. First, the Other Bets are early-stage. Second, they represent an aggregation of businesses operating in different industries. And finally, they may be impacted by one-time items like partnership deals. For the third quarter, Other Bets revenue was $197 million, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber, and Verily. Operating loss excluding SBC was $665 million in the third quarter. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $865 million. Other Bets CapEx was $324 million in Q3, primarily reflecting ongoing investments in our Fiber business. I'd like to close with a few observations on our progress since the creation of Alphabet just over a year ago as well as a review of our key themes. As we've frequently noted, our move to Alphabet was motivated by our belief that revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas. Long-term success requires a commitment to making bets, putting the right talent and resources behind those bets, and remaining flexible and dynamic as we pursue them. We believe our structure provides the transparency and oversight needed to make smart choices about our investment opportunities both within Google and across Other Bets. As we reach for moon shots that will have a big impact in the longer term, it's inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way and that some efforts will be more successful than others. Over the past year, for example, you've seen us make progress and accelerate our efforts in some areas while repositioning or taking a pause in others. We are taking the steps necessary to lay the foundation for a stronger future. Looking ahead, first regarding revenue, our revenue growth reflects our sustained investment in innovation. Within Google, this relentless focus has led to innovations across our advertising platforms that have driven continued strong growth on a very large base, while at the same time we're building new businesses to serve as sources of future revenue growth. Most notably, Google Cloud is generating substantial revenue growth, reflecting the ongoing momentum in the business as well as the enormous opportunity in this area. And earlier this month, we launched a new line of hardware devices that, for the first time, brings consumers the best of Google through both hardware and software developed by Google. As discussed previously, because most of our Other Bets are pre-revenue, the Other Bets revenue line provides only partial insight regarding our progress, which we aim to supplement with insight regarding product progress. For example, at Nest, product innovations and improvements, including the new outdoor version of the Nest Cam, are leading to increased consumer adoption of its suite of products for the home. Our self-driving car team is making terrific progress in transforming mobility, with our fleet of test cars recently passing the 2 million-mile mark of autonomous driving. We are now testing our cars in four cities, enabling us to experience varied weather and driving conditions. Second, as to expenses, as I mentioned last quarter, there are a number of factors driving higher TAC in both our Sites and network businesses, and those factors persisted in the third quarter. The shift to mobile in Q3 remained the largest driver of the increase in Sites TAC as a percentage of revenue. We expect Sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of Sites revenue. The growth in network TAC in Q3 was due to the ongoing adoption of programmatic platforms by advertisers, which are subject to a higher TAC rate, a trend we expect to continue. Furthermore, with respect to Google's operating expenses, we remain committed to investing in the compelling opportunities we've identified. Turning to Other Bets, we're building out these businesses systematically and thoughtfully, investing commensurate with requirements given the opportunities we see. Before moving on from expenses, one reminder regarding the fourth quarter; as discussed in prior years, our marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back half of the year due to the holiday season. Relative to last year, we have an expanded portfolio of hardware products, and therefore expect marketing costs to increase in the fourth quarter to support the line. Third regarding CapEx, at Google the team continues to drive meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure. With regard to CapEx investments for Other Bets, our Fiber investment remains the primary driver. Fourth, our balance sheet; our balance sheet remains a powerful tool reflecting the strength of our cash flow and thereby giving us the ability to invest aggressively to support our long-term growth. Our primary focus is just that, investing in the breadth of opportunities across Alphabet. As discussed previously, our capital allocation framework begins with our outlook for the businesses, including a sensitivity analysis regarding potential CapEx and M&A, as well as a view regarding working capital and a prudent liquidity buffer. This framework further considers complementary uses such as the share repurchase. As announced today our board has authorized us to commence a repurchase of our Class C capital stock of up to $7,019,340,976.83. In conclusion, in the third quarter we again delivered strong revenue growth while broadening our portfolio of products and services. Thanks to all of our colleagues around the globe for their ingenuity and passion for pushing the frontier. I will now turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Ruth. I don't think I can remember a busier time in Google's history than the past few months. We introduced the world to the Google Assistant, powered by our state-of-the-art machine learning technology. We unveiled a beautiful lineup of new hardware devices, including Google Home and the Pixel phone, which is getting great reviews. We launched a new messaging app, Allo, and a new video chat app, Duo. It's been an incredible quarter. Through it all, we are laser-focused on the priorities I outlined earlier this year, and in the next few minutes I'll quickly go through our progress this past quarter. We feel well positioned as we transition to a new era of computing. This new era is one in which people will experience computing more naturally and seamlessly in the context of their lives, powered by intelligent assistants and the cloud. This transition is as significant as the move over the last decade from desktops to mobile devices. As we've rolled out products like the Google Assistant, Pixel, Google Home, and Allo, we have gotten a glimpse of that future. And with our growing cloud business, we are helping our enterprise customers take advantage of this new era of computing as well. Today I want to walk through our progress across Google's key focus areas and the success of our growing advertising business. First, making knowledge and information accessible to everyone, we have long aimed to help people find the information that they want right when they need it and sometimes even before they think to ask for it. We reached an important milestone in that journey this quarter with the launch of the Google Assistant, which allows you to type or talk with Google in a natural conversational way to help you get things done regardless of the device you're using. We first introduced it in our smart messaging app, Allo, which lets you chat with the Assistant. You can even add it to a group conversation to help you and your friends decide where to go for dinner. Early adoption of Allo and Duo has been great and has exceeded our expectations. And the Assistant is core to the Pixel phone and Google Home. With Google Home, you can ask the Assistant to cast a song to your living room speaker or turn on the lights in your kitchen. And with Pixel, by simply holding the home button, you can ask the Assistant to send a text to your mom or pull up pictures of your cat in Google Photos. I hope you all get to try them out soon. The Assistant is simple, easy to use, and it is just the beginning. It's going to get so much better. We are excited to bring new features to you across more of your contacts soon. The Assistant all possible thanks to our years of investments in computer science and machine learning. Our knowledge graph now understands over 70 billion facts about people, places, and things in the real world. And just last month, we announced our latest research on neural nets, which has given us a huge leap in translation quality. This breakthrough will help us provide even more accurate translations for people around the world. And before I finish talking about access to information, I want to highlight the important work that our teams are doing to help American voters stay informed about the upcoming election. We've launched improved search tools to help voters get registered, find key deadlines and learn how to vote early or by mail. We launched these in both English and Spanish. I don't speak Spanish, but I checked Google Translate, and I wanted to remind everyone, no se olviden de votar. [Don't forget to vote.] Second, moving to our efforts to bring more content to more places, key to making information accessible is helping people find more great content across platforms like the web, YouTube, and Google Play. Just recently, one of our key efforts to make the mobile web faster, the open-source Project AMP [Accelerated Mobile Pages] celebrated its first birthday. It's being embraced by a very broad range of publishers and sites around the world, covering more than 700,000 domains. One example, tens of millions of WordPress sites now have AMP pages with page load speeds up to 90% faster than normal in some cases. We are also working on an initiative called AMP for Ads, a new approach to creating and selling ads with speed at the heart of the experience. On YouTube, we continue to invest in bringing engaging content to the platform. We worked with many news organizations to livestream all three U.S. presidential debates, and we saw record-breaking interest from the YouTube community. In fact, the three debates ranked as the three most viewed political live streams of all time on YouTube, with over 8.5 million hours watched live, a 5X increase from the 2012 debates. Elections-related searches on YouTube are also at an all-time high, with searches for U.S. election content up almost 550% compared to this time in the last election. And YouTube originals like the recently released Single by 30 remain incredibly popular and continue to drive subscriptions for the YouTube brand. And in Google Play, earlier this summer we introduced Family Library, a way for up to six family members to share app, game, movie, TV show, or book purchases. Third, powerful computing platforms and hardware; we have long been committed to building powerful computing platforms like Android, Chrome, and now Daydream in VR, so that people can have great experiences regardless of their device. Taking a step back, we have always believed that an open, horizontal, free platform like Android breeds more innovation, more options for users, and better business models for partners. We open-source our code, we build the most open APIs possible, and we work to create a sustainable open ecosystem. With over 4,000 distinct Android devices, we are really proud of how so many partners are having success on the platform. This quarter we began rolling out our newest update on Android called Nougat and shared that we are bringing Android apps to Chromebooks. We can't wait to see all of the incredible experiences that developers will build on Daydream, our newest platform for high-quality virtual reality experiences via smartphones. We also think there's an opportunity for us to more deeply integrate software and hardware together to deliver great experiences that we hope will also contribute to future innovation and development of the ecosystem. Earlier this month, we launched a family of hardware products, made by Google, which in addition to the Google Pixel and Google Home, include: the Daydream View headset and controller; our premium TV streaming device, Chromecast Ultra; and the new connected Wi-Fi system called Google Wifi. This portfolio of products is an example of how we can marry the best of hardware and software to deliver the best Google experience to people. Fourth, our increasing momentum in cloud; as we focus our efforts in the cloud, we continue to see strong customer engagement. Last month at our Horizon event, we introduced a new business unit, Google Cloud, our unique and broad portfolio of products and services that let our customers operate easily in a digital world with the performance they demand. Google Cloud includes Google Cloud platform, our user-facing collaboration and productivity applications, now called G Suite, all of our data analytics and machine learning tools and APIs, and the enterprise-ready Android phones, tablets, and Chromebooks that access the cloud. Our Cloud team has also been busy delivering new capabilities for our customers. We announced plans to expand to eight new cloud regions in 2017, from Mumbai to Singapore to S\u00e3o Paulo to Frankfurt, with more to come. We announced an enhanced media conference experience in Google Hangouts with an updated user interface, instant screen sharing, support for 50 participants, and a seamless integration into Calendar. We've been using the same technology to power meetings at Google, and are so excited to share the improved experience with our customers. We also significantly upgraded Google BigQuery, our fully managed data analytics warehouse, and made Google Cloud Machine Learning available in beta to help businesses easily train quality machine learning models. In addition to building the best products and infrastructure, we are partnering with great companies. This quarter, we forged new partnerships with OCTA [Orange County Transit Authority], Box, and Accenture. Our investments in machine learning continue to be a very clear advantage for Google Cloud, and we are helping customers apply ML in very concrete ways. For example, Ocado, the world's largest online-only grocery retailer, is using machine learning to categorize and prioritize customer emails, which will help their support center respond to customers faster. As we officially move into the Google Cloud era, our goal remains the same. We want to build the most open cloud for all businesses and make it easy for them to build and run great software. The team is firing on all cylinders to create the best cloud products in the industry for our customers. Now moving on to growing advertising business, which is thriving in a mobile world. Our proposition to marketers on mobile is simple and is resonating. Our mobile properties like Search, YouTube, Maps, and Google Play are where people turn when they are actively interested in something. They are using our services because they want to actively watch something they are passionate about or because they want to know, go, do, or buy something. They are super-attentive and engaged. It's just like people used to be glued to their TV screen during prime time. Our services are prime time for the mobile world. This matters for marketers because those prime time moments when people are actively interested and attentive are the perfect time for a brand to place their ads. For instance, hotel chain La Quinta now sees a third of their website traffic coming from mobile, and they use our hotel ads to help them reach travelers right when they are looking for hotel stays. They have found conversion rates to be twice as high with hotel ads compared to regular mobile traffic, which is helping them capitalize on those prime time moments when travelers are on their phones and ready to book. In video, YouTube continues to shine. More than 1 billion monthly users are watching hundreds of millions of hours every single day. YouTube has become the platform of choice for major brands, with a highly engaged audience, the best formats, and industry-leading measurement tools. Recent research found that nearly half of U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 54 say that at least once a month, YouTube helps them in making a decision about buying something. One format that's been working really well for ad prices are bumper ads, which are snackable, 6-second videos that help brands drive incremental reach and frequency. Brands like Universal Pictures have been pairing these shorter videos with their standard length ads on YouTube, and they're seeing great results, especially on mobile. We also recently announced expanded capabilities to show marketers how TV and YouTube campaigns increase Google and YouTube searches for their brand. From early tests, we have seen that YouTube generates almost twice as many searches per impression than TV generates. In fact, across our advertising business, measurement is a critical investment. We want to give marketers the best tools out there to close the loop between television and digital, online and offline. For example, global retailer IKEA, with their agency iProspect UK, used our store visits measurement tools to see how effective their digital marketing campaigns were at bringing shoppers into their stores. By incorporating store visit data, they realized that more than 10% of the people who clicked on their search ads went on to visit a physical store, and that their ROI from online ads was actually five times higher than they had previously estimated. We introduced even more measurement solutions at this year's Advertising Week in New York, helping marketers close the loop with newer tools like location extensions and store visits measurements for the Google Display Network. We have thousands of great partners who are getting terrific results from our products. I'm really pleased with how our business teams are working closer than ever with their advertising partners, agencies, marketers, and publishers. We can't succeed unless they do, and we have made a huge push to develop deeper partnerships and long-term win-win relationships. It's a big focus for us. To wrap up, it's been an incredibly exciting few months and a very successful quarter. We feel extremely confident as we move into a new era of computing and are thrilled to be working with our partners as we embark on the journey together. I want to thank all of the Googlers around the world who work tirelessly to turn ideas into reality for our users and partners. It's an honor to work alongside you every day. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Sundar. We will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question come from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open. Eric J. Sheridan: Thank you so much for taking the question. Sundar, maybe for you, on the enterprise, thanks for laying out all the vision for the medium to long term on the enterprise and cloud. I think one of the big questions we get from investors all the time are where are the key areas you need to invest going forward in both capabilities, go-to-market, and how those might evolve over the next couple years. And then maybe a second question for Ruth, which is more a housekeeping matter, Ruth, with highlighting the increased marketing expense behind the product launches this year, were you referencing quarter-over-quarter or comparing year-over-year when you also launched products a year ago? Thanks so much. Sundar Pichai : On cloud, let me talk about a few areas. We have stepped up our partnering considerably so that we can offer our customers everything they want, and we have more vehicles for going to market. So scaling up through partnerships is a big area of focus and investment for us. We are also establishing a large cloud machine learning group so that we can take advantages of working with our cloud customers and make machine learning more accessible to all of them. I would say other areas are hiring across sales, engineering, and marketing. And as we head into 2017, I expect cloud to be one of our largest areas of investment and head count growth. Ruth Porat : And then on your second question, there were really two parts to the statement. One, the obvious, is that sales and marketing is seasonally higher whenever we go into the holiday season. And so year on year, I wanted just to accentuate the point that we expect this trend to be pronounced this year because we're expanding. We're launching an even more expanded suite of hardware products. So it's really emphasizing the fact that the fourth quarter is higher and even more so this year with the expanded suite. Eric J. Sheridan: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Thank you. I also wanted to ask a follow-up on the cloud. I guess I was wondering, Sundar, if you could share with us. What milestones should we be watching for in this business? And then also, if you had to characterize \u2013 you mentioned a couple different ones, but I'm wondering. What type of workloads are you having the most success with in GCP, and what's on your customers' wish list? What's the top one or two things that your enterprise customers for cloud might be asking for? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Heather. In general, the way we see it is that customers don't want to be locked in and they want to make sure their workloads can work in and be managed by containers that run on any platform. So our virtual machines and containers, including excellent open-sourced container management Kubernetes, which was developed by Google, offers that solution. So Kubernetes manages the provisioning, reliability, and auto-scaling of workloads. So we want to pursue a hybrid strategy, including on-prem and in all public clouds. So from a customer standpoint, they will want to use an open source workload management product, and Kubernetes can work with multiple customers. So that's broadly how we think about it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ross Sandler : Thanks, guys, two questions. Sundar, first on the Alphabet structure high level, so there's been some incredible innovation that's come out of Alphabet and the various businesses. If we look at something like Otto, which was acquired by Uber, or Niantic, which was the old Google Maps team, those were teams that were inside of Google that left Alphabet to start a new company and could have been potentially wholly-owned businesses of Google in a parallel universe. So do you think this structure is ideal for entire companies, or is it just new products and new technologies that you see as the vision here for Alphabet long term? And then, Ruth, the second question is just on \u2013 core operating margins for Google have declined a little bit versus the prior quarter trend of increasing. Can you give us some color on how much of that was due to mix towards cloud and other things that might carry lower margin versus margin compression within the advertising business? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Ross, on the first question, I would say overall when I look across Google and Alphabet, the number of areas where we have been able to build world-class products and achieve scale and success, we today have over seven products which serve 1 billion users each, so I think our track record speaks there. And we generally want to encourage a culture of innovation and that's what we focus on, and I think it is fine that some of them happen outside. So we don't view it as a zero-sum game, and we're very comfortable with how we approach it. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of the margin trends, so overall operating margins year on year are up modestly on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, and that primarily reflects trends in Other Bets. I think your question was probably more within Google. The operating margin on a non-GAAP basis is down modestly year on year. That's primarily to other cost of sales as distinct from TAC. The Google GAAP operating margins year on year and quarter on quarter do reflect the impact of the equity refresh that we called out last quarter that I talked about. I think one of the core things to your question is just how we're looking at it, and our view continues to be that given the breadth of opportunities and our commitment to long-term revenue growth, as we've talked about, quarter after quarter we do remain committed to investing in this growing set of opportunities. And we've spent a lot of time trying to manage that revenue growth, and as I said, manage expense growth with the utmost respect for the resources deployed and getting the best return on those resources. So there are a number of different factors in here. I think I mentioned one of the things as you're looking forward was the sales and marketing. And just to make another point, which I said my opening comments, we do expect ongoing gross margin pressure from higher TAC associated with Mobile Search and with programmatic. That does still result in more revenue and gross profit dollars but at a lower margin, and that's the other really important point with our starting point. We are continuing to invest, and we would point you to the revenue and gross profit dollars that come from that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. With Google Home and the Pixel phones, are you rethinking at all your go-to-market strategy in terms of distribution and marketing? Google over the years has put out different hardware products. Have there been learnings from that that make you approach those two particular areas in Google Home and the Pixel phone lineup differently? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Mark. As you point out, we have done hardware products over the years, but we saw an opportunity to bring all our display hardware efforts together in a thoughtful structure. I'm glad Rick [Osterloh] is here, and we've been very focused on how we approach everything end to end so that we can bring together software and hardware for a great user experience. So along those lines, both Google Home in Google Pixel are important new efforts for us, and I think we will thoughtfully evolve our go-to-market strategy as well. These are important areas. And you already see with Google Pixel we have a deep partnership at Verizon with which we are going to market in the U.S. And so we are constantly thinking about how to do this well, and you will see new approaches as we go through it more. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Sundar. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Douglas T. Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, you talked about a lot of products across advertising and hardware. I think one thing we did not hear about was Maps. And I think you've talked about it in the past as 1 billion-plus users and pretty massive engagement. So can you talk a little bit more about the monetization strategy here and how you can really sell more advertising here but also preserve the user experience at the same time? And maybe talk about a timeframe that we could see more here. Thanks. Sundar Pichai : That's a good question. Today, a big part of what you're seeing with our transition to mobile that's working really well. The reason Mobile Search and mobile monetization works really well for us is because a lot of it is inherently local by nature. And the thing which helps us deliver a great local search experience is Maps. And so that's the direction we have always pointed in. We want it to be a great experience for consumers as Google Maps, but in terms of also really enhancing the local search experience. And I think you'll continue to see us perceive it that way. And over time to the extent there are opportunities to create value within the application itself, we'll pursue that as well. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Peter C. Stabler: Good afternoon, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask one about Voice. Sundar, you talked about the success you've had in improving your natural language recognition, and we know that voice queries are growing quickly. I'm wondering if you could share your thoughts on how the increase in voice queries may or may not impact monetization going forward. Is it a risk, or is the growth of voice queries much more skewed to less commercial activity? Just any thoughts there, thanks so much. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Peter. From my standpoint, I look at it as \u2013 and if you look back in time, all this is \u2013 computing is becoming more and more important to people, and so they are engaging with it more and more. So as we went from desktops to mobile, it's not like one replaced the other. The sum total of all of this, it expanded the pie. I approach this the same way. I think as I see people using Voice, et cetera, they are interacting more with computing and with Google too. So we view this as providing users more access across many different surfaces, many different contexts, being there for them when they need it. So in that view, I think it will all be a big positive for us going forward. Peter C. Stabler: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my question. I have two. Just to go back to the Voice Search question, Sundar, could you just talk a little bit about if we do continue to migrate toward a world of Voice Search, just talk about infrastructure, potential build you think you need to put in place to continue to monetize search in a voice world as well as you do in a phone or a desktop world. And then secondly, could you just talk a little bit about where you are on the rollout of extended text ads? I know you talked about a 20% bump to click-through rates. I was just curious for where you are now, a push-out, and is there any update on the click-throughs? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : On the first question, I think I briefly answered it before. In terms of \u2013 we are thinking about the voice experience deeply end to end. A lot of it is going \u2013 because of how we are approaching our core investments both from a software and hardware standpoint, so we leverage it all to make it better. So for example, even things like TP usage we talked about at Google I/O play a role into something like Voice Search you're talking about. And as we evolve the Google Assistant, I think voice is going to play a major role that way as well. So we are in very early days of all of this in relation to our overall volumes we see, and so I think we will be thoughtful about it. For example, the Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the Voice experience. So it's early days, and I think we will evolve it a lot in the coming years. In terms of your second question around expanded text ads, I would say again it's early. It's being adopted by advertisers across the board. We see both large and small advertisers using it. For us, we find advertisers who actually spend their time being thoughtful about the ad creatives and extensively testing and optimizing for this new format, they find strong performance. So we are pleased with the progress so far, but the transition is going to take some time as advertisers get comfortable with it, but we are excited about it. Brian Nowak : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura. Your line is now open. Anthony DiClemente : Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. First one for Ruth, heading into this quarter's results, you had called out the ad format change in the third quarter of last year, which had driven a step up in the year-ago growth rate. I wonder, is there anything specific on the revenue side that you'd like to call out in terms of comparisons versus the fourth quarter of last year as we try to calibrate our revenue expectations for the fourth quarter, either in terms of Mobile Search, YouTube, or ad tech programmatic? And then my second question is either for Ruth or Sundar. Can you just talk about the decision to pause efforts for Google Fiber? I'm wondering, was that decision more about financial discipline, as you I think explained, Ruth, in your prepared remarks for the Other Bets, or does it more have to do with the shift to wireless Internet technology or point-to-point wireless, which ultimately can take the place of a Fiber or facilities-based infrastructure over time? Thank you. Ruth Porat : Okay, great, two good questions. So in terms of Sites revenue, we are very pleased by the strength. It was broad-based. It had two real drivers, first, our ongoing focus on improving the experience for advertisers and users. And we introduced a number of enhancements, including format changes in ad tools. I think the most important point is that no one enhancement came close to the magnitude of the changes that we made in the third quarter of last year. That's why we kept calling out the 2015 change. And what's been gratifying is in the aggregate the results reflect the benefit of ongoing innovation. But very importantly, it wasn't one particular item. The second contributor is the secular shift to mobile, and we continue to benefit from that, be an important part of enhancing opportunities for engagement. As we look forward to the fourth quarter, I think that was part of your question as well. I think the only thing to point out is that in looking at growth rates, we're obviously at a higher revenue base versus last year, so that to us is an important point. It may be obvious, but important to note there. In terms of Fiber, the impetus for it was really about the opportunities that we see to focus on innovation, and what does that mean if the objective with Other Bets is really these 10X opportunities. And when you go back to the initial impetus for creating the business, it was the founders' view that there's a sizable opportunity given the need for abundant connectivity on networks that are always fast and always open, and we do continue to be committed to that vision. The team had some important breakthroughs in new technologies. You noted the most important in our view, all that we're doing with wireless, but also technologies that are key to implementation. And we believe that both of those, a number of things they're doing enhance both our effectiveness and efficiency. And so we wanted to focus on the potential with these efforts before we reaccelerate deployment. And it was about ensuring that we can take advantage of those before again pushing forth. We were very active in a lot of cities in the third quarter alone. We rolled out four new cities, so that brings us to 12 cities across the U.S. where we're deployed, in construction, or in development, and we're making great progress in those cities. We remain very committed to growth across those cities. And then we also have a presence in six cities with our wireless acquisition, Webpass. So we're pausing for now our work in eight cities where we've been in exploratory discussions. But very much to your question, it's to better integrate some of the technology work we've been developing, and there's more detail on the cities on the Fiber side to the extent you want to go into those. Anthony DiClemente : Great. Thanks, Ruth. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Okay, thank you very much. So, Sundar, it seems like from the outside looking in, the pace of product development and release seems to have accelerated, while at the same time it seems like you're gaining efficiencies with the assets you're deploying to run your business and as your CapEx growth is moderating. So I'm wondering what concrete steps you may have taken to increase productivity or focus at the company and what you're doing now to continue to drive those gains going forward. Then separately, as you called out earlier, you are shipping an unprecedented amount of hardware devices. So as you think about what your product portfolio might look like over the next five years or even the next decade, does the Pixel phone market change in direction for Google to become maybe more of an integrated software and hardware company? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Stephen. On the first thing, I would say we are very focused on our core mission. And we see a huge opportunity to do that in a unique way, thanks to what we view as a point of inflection with machine learning. So refocusing the company on a set of initiatives, recognizing that point of inflection is what has helped us really focus on things. And things like the Google Assistant are a manifestation of that, and you will see us continue to stay focused and innovate that way. In terms of hardware, I think in our vision, computing is becoming more and more integral. It's going to be there for users in many different contexts. And so to really think and evolve it, you need to think about software and hardware together. That's where a lot of innovations happen. And so for us to push the paradigm, push the boundary, we are very committed to doing that. So it's a thoughtful effort from us. But overall, as I said in my remarks, we deeply remain committed to building an open ecosystem because at the end of the day we want Google to be there for every user everywhere. And to do that well, we want to work with partners and build a great ecosystem to make it happen. Ruth Porat : And just to add a bit more to Sundar's first answer or first response to your question about efficiency as it's expressed through CapEx spend, I think it will probably be helpful to add. The pace of spend reflects the ongoing success of the team driving meaningful efficiencies in planning and operations for our technical infrastructure. And that's enabled us to support growing demand but at a stable investment level. We've talked about that on prior calls as well, but I think we're proud of what they've been doing there. Some examples of efficiencies include improvements in server utilization and the use of machine learning that Sundar has talked about, and the deployment of innovations like our Tensor Processing Units that he has commented. So the main thing is we're building greater productivity with existing machines. And what's important to note is that's not only good for Google products generally, but it's also valuable to our cloud offering for our enterprise customers. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Sena of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Kenneth Sena : Thank you. Sundar, you mentioned a point of inflection within machine learning. Can you talk a bit more about the trade-offs in the productization and sale of that inflection through Google Cloud versus leveraging that innovation yourself through Google Assistant? And maybe for Ruth, just any thoughts on potential future disclosures around the cloud business, that would be great. Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On the first one, look, I think we are \u2013 it's a big platform shift, and it has to be available for everyone. So we've always, just like we have done with things like Android, when we see platform shifts, we provide Android to everyone. So that's the way we think about Google Cloud. We want to make sure that all these new capabilities for machine learning and AI are available through Google Cloud to all our partners. We don't see it as a zero-sum game. I think internally, core to our mission, we see areas where we can execute and we will continue to do that, but we want to do both and we can do it thoughtfully well. Ruth Porat : On your second question, we constantly look to assess if or when additional data makes sense given specific performances. And when we went through the third quarter results, that has been our intent with all of the color commentary on cloud. I guess the only other thing to add is that the largest percentage growth year on year in our other revenue line, actually even across all of our revenue lines, was in our Google Cloud platform, and that reflects significant momentum in compute and storage. Kenneth Sena : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Thank you. Sundar, I apologize if I missed it. But could you talk about machine learning in search and how much it's making a difference over the past few quarters and how much you still have to go, how important that is to revenues? And then, Ruth, a couple questions, any thoughts on whether hardware sales could make a difference to margins going forward, and also on the stock-based comp, how Google thinks about that expense internally? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On machine learning, in areas like search and even ads, on search we've had an effort called RankBrain, which is bringing Google Brain in the context of search. And we've made great progress on it, but I would still characterize it as very early stages in terms of the long-term impact we can have. Generally and similarly, we are in very, very early stages of incorporating machine learning, the newer machine learning systems in ads. And again, that's the beginning of a long journey as well. Overall, I think all of these systems are incredibly complex systems, and they are handcrafted systems over many, many years. And so over time, I think machine learning will surface newer approaches and newer insights. And so we see it as a huge area of opportunity, but it will play out over a period of time. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of the hardware family, I think Sundar has given a lot of color on that. It's still early days with the rollout of some of these newer lines that we're super-excited about. And so early to make a call on that, but certainly investing meaningfully in the line given the importance we see in this. And then in terms of stock-based compensation, we've always said we're going to remain focused on long-term revenue growth, and that does require investing in talent. And we do believe equity ownership is a really valuable part of our overall compensation, consistent with alignment of interests. It's something we keep an eye on and we're mindful of the full cost of equity-based compensation and certainly look at that as part of the overall costs that we're investing in, in and across the businesses. Justin Post : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Daniel Salmon : Hey, guys. Good afternoon, thanks for taking the question. Sundar, last month Google was part of the founding group for the Partnership for AI. And I was just curious to hear your thoughts on what your goals are for the group and how you may take lessons back to your leadership at Google. Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Look, I think I'm very, very glad to see the group come together. We are in extraordinarily early days for AI and it's super-important, but we approach it thoughtfully as an industry. I am encouraged to see the commitment across these companies. Our goal is to promote open collaboration, help the public understand AI, and establish best practices in R&D. Without something like this, I think ideas would develop in silos, and so I think it's good to do this to promote an informed dialogue on AI. And so I'm pretty excited all along, just like with TensorFlow, where we are doing this in an open way and all the other things we have done at Google. I think it's important as we work on new technology to contribute and to give back. And so in that context, I think all of this is personally very meaningful to me. Daniel Salmon : Great. Thanks, Sundar. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West (53:46) for any further remarks. Unverified Participant : Thanks to everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter 2016 call. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ellen West : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. While you've been waiting for the call to start, you've been listening to Ingrid Michaelson. In just a decade, she has released six albums, five of which have charted. The song you just heard, Celebrate, is from her latest release titled, \"It Doesn't Have To Make Sense\". Please check out her YouTube channel. Now, I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2015, filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website, located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now, I'll turn the call over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Our revenue of $26.1 billion in the fourth quarter underscores the continued excellent performance of our businesses globally. For the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 24% in constant currency versus 4Q 2015, notwithstanding a challenging year-on-year comparison. Advertising revenue growth was driven by Mobile Search with ongoing strength in YouTube and programmatic. We also had substantial growth in other revenues from hardware, Play and Cloud. Our outline for today's call is first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Given the obvious seasonality in Q4, I'll focus on year-over-year changes in our results. You can find quarterly comparisons in the earnings release. Second, I'll review the results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with a summary of the full-year results and our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take questions. Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenue was $26.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $202 million or $15 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenue grew 24% year-over-year. Alphabet revenues by geography highlight the strength of our business around the globe. U.S. revenue was up 24% year-over-year to $12.7 billion. U.K. revenue was up 7% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, reflecting the continued weakness of the British pound relative to last year. In fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 21% year-over-year. Rest of world revenue was up 24% versus last year to $11.3 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 26% year-over-year. GAAP other cost of revenues was $5.8 billion, up 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $5.5 billion, up 41% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses; specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers including depreciation and content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube as well as hardware. The impact of our Q4 hardware launches is reflected in both revenues and cost of revenues. However, it's important to note the cost of revenues was also affected by approximately $320 million of one-time charges related to equipment and another adjustments, which were unrelated to hardware. GAAP operating expenses were $8.8 billion in the quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $7.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Year-on-year comparisons in part reflect the impact of the expenses from project milestones and Other Bets in 4Q 2015 that we discussed last year. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $6.6 billion, up 23% versus last year. The operating margin was 25%. Non-GAAP operating income was $8.5 billion, up 24% versus last year. The operating margin was 33%. Stock-based compensation totaled $1.8 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Headcount at the end of the quarter was just over 72,000, up 2,100 people from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as Cloud including the addition of employees from our Apigee acquisition. Other income and expense was $218 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 22% for the fourth quarter reflecting the geographic mix of earnings and certain discrete items affecting our U.S. rate. Our effective tax rate for the full year 2016 was 19%. Net income was $5.3 billion on a GAAP basis and $6.6 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7.56 on a GAAP basis and $9.36 on a non-GAAP basis. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $3.1 billion. Operating cash flow was $9.4 billion with free cash flow of $6.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $86.3 billion of which approximately $52 billion or 61% is held overseas. Let me now turn to our segment financial results starting with the Google segment. Revenue was $25.8 billion, up 22% year-over-year which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $18 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year. Year-on-year growth reflects strength in Mobile Search. YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView including buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager. Network revenue was $4.4 billion, up 7% year-on-year reflecting the ongoing strong growth of programmatic and AdMob offset by the traditional network businesses. Other revenue for Google was $3.4 billion, up 62% year-over-year with strong performance from each of hardware, Play and Cloud. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Let me remind you that these metrics are affected by currency movements. Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.8 billion or 22% of total advertising revenue and up 20% year-over-year. The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue, as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenue, reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely Mobile Search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up as a result of an increase in the Sites TAC rate driven by the shift to mobile which was partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites which carries lower TAC. Operating income excluding SBC was $9.5 billion, up 19% versus last year for an operating margin of 37%. Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 29% year-over-year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $7.9 billion, up 17% versus last year, and the operating margin was 31%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.9 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction. Turning to Other Bets, I'll cover results for the full year 2016 because it's most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon as discussed previously. Results for the quarter are in our earnings release. For the full year 2016, Other Bets revenue was $809 million, up 82% versus 2015, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss excluding SBC was $2.9 billion for the full year 2016, a slight decline from 2015. Including the impact of SBC, the operating loss was $3.6 billion for the full year, an increase of 4% over 2015. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $1.4 billion for the full year 2016, up 63% over 2015. Before I move to my conclusion, I'll quickly cover some specific changes to our past practices. First, we are making changes to our non-GAAP reporting. SBC has always been an important part of how we reward our employees in a way that aligns their interests with those of all shareholders. Although it's not a cash expense, we consider it to be a real cost of running our business because SBC is critical to our ability to attract and retain the best talent in the world. Starting with our first quarter results for 2017, we will no longer regularly exclude stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP results. Noncash stock-based compensation will continue to be reported on our cash flow statement, but we will no longer be providing a reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures that reflects SBC and related tax benefits. Second, we are shifting the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle for employees to the first quarter of every year. The next full year equity refresh will occur in the first quarter of 2018. Because the last full employee equity refresh occurred in the third quarter of 2016, we are providing employees with a one-time half grant in the first quarter of 2017. Overall, total SBC for 2017 will be roughly the same as it would have been had we maintained a Q3 refresh cycle. However, given the shift in refresh timing, there will not be the historical seasonal increase in SBC in Q3 and Q4. We do not plan any changes to our senior executives' equity refresh, which occurs every two years with an excellent plan for 2018. Third, to hedge our non-U.S. dollar earnings, we are moving from using options-only to using primarily forwards. We believe they will be a more effective way to hedge earnings. We intend to continue to use options selectively. We continue to believe that constant currency revenue growth provides the best insight into underlying trends by isolating the impact of currency movements on revenue. We will continue to provide constant currency results for consolidated revenues, as well as for revenues by geography. This will give you a view into the effects of currency movements on our revenue. Turning now to our full-year 2016 performance and outlook. 2016 was simply a great year for us. Our extraordinarily talented employees worked very hard and successfully for our users around the globe. That commitment is reflected in the company's exceptional financial results. For the full year 2016, consolidated revenue grew 20% and excluding the impact of currency movements grew 24%. GAAP operating income was up 23%. This performance is a testament to the ongoing innovation that is driving our success in Mobile Search, YouTube and programmatic advertising, each of which we believe has only begun to scratch the surface. We remain excited about the sizable opportunities that have not yet been tapped. Alongside these businesses, we are focused on growing additional revenue streams within Google over the medium and long-term. In 2016, our other revenue line grew 41% on a full year basis, reflecting the growth in our Play, hardware and Cloud businesses. We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube. We're investing in our Cloud and hardware businesses as well as our newer non-ad revenue sources for YouTube in order to accelerate their progress as major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years. We're also investing significantly in the machine learning capabilities and next-generation computing infrastructure that will propel Google's growth over the longer-term. For our Other Bets, we continue to calibrate the magnitude and pace of investment appropriate to their individual execution paths. A couple of our recent announcements demonstrate our approach here. First, in December, Waymo graduated into a standalone business within Other Bets. We did this because Waymo achieved agreed thresholds on the path to commercialization in its technical and business model. Waymo continues to excel at safety, has begun putting its new Chrysler Pacifica minivans on the road and is continuing to drive down hardware costs. Nest delivered an outstanding performance this holiday season with sales of key products more than doubling over the two weeks including Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And just this morning, Verily announced that Temasek has agreed to invest $800 million for a minority stake in the company. Temasek's extensive experience with life sciences and healthcare companies and deep understanding of Asian markets make it a valuable long-term partner for Verily. The internal transparency we've provided to our business leaders across the Other Bets and Google is helping us to allocate resources more thoughtfully across the opportunities that we see. We remain committed to managing for long-term revenue and EPS growth for dollars rather than margin targets, while exercising careful stewardship over the amounts and pace of investment. I will now turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Ruth. 2016 was a great year for Google, and 2017 is shaping up to be even more exciting. This quarter was about the business firing on all cylinders and terrific progress across Google's newer areas of investment. Today, I'm going to talk about three things. First, the key trend powering Google today, machine learning and how it's improving our products and creating lots of opportunities. In particular, how it's underpinning our core mission of providing access to information for everyone, especially via the Google Assistant, which is off to a great start. Second, I want to talk about three of our biggest bets, YouTube, Cloud and hardware, where we are making great progress. And third, I'll discuss the great trends we are seeing across the platforms; our vibrant computing platforms, Android, Chrome and Daydream, strong momentum in Google Play, as well as our thriving advertising platform. First, machine learning and access to information. As I've shared before, computing is moving from a mobile-first to AI-first with more universal ambient and intelligent computing that you can interact with naturally, all made smarter by the progress we are making with machine learning. 2016 was the year that this became central to who we are as a company and the products that we built. We had more than 350 launches powered by machine learning across areas like search, maps, messaging and Google Play. You've heard lots of these examples; easier e-mail replies and inbox, better YouTube recommendations, the incredible cameras on our Pixel phones, and smarter bidding for advertisers in AdWords. A centerpiece of our machine learning efforts is the Google Assistant which allows users to have a natural conversation with Google to help them get things done across their experience. It's off to a great start. You can easily ask it to navigate home, tell you about your schedule for the day, or even play trivia. We reached a milestone last month with our announcement of the Assistant developer platform called Actions on Google. It gives developers like Uber, SongPop and Headspace the opportunity to build conversation actions for Google Home, and we'll expand it even further this year. The Assistant is baked into our smart messaging app, Allo, which we expanded this quarter in languages like Hindi, Brazilian Portuguese and Japanese. This quarter, using neural machine translation, we have improved our translation ability more in one single leap than all our improvements over the last 10 years combined. We'll be rolling neural machine translation out across to more than 100 languages available in Google Translate in 2017 and also for all of our Cloud customers through the Google Cloud Translation API. And Google Photos, which as you know has machine learning at its heart, continues to grow in popularity. Last quarter, we launched PhotoScan, which helps you digitize all of those old printed photos that are probably stored in a shoebox in your closet, to keep them safe, organized and shareable. In February, we are hosting a summit where our machine learning team and other experts will discuss the future of the TensorFlow open-source initiative and share some of their latest demos. Now, I want to spend some time talking about three big bets, YouTube, Cloud and hardware. First, YouTube, which remains the premier destination for online video globally and is seeing tremendous growth. At the heart of YouTube's success is its booming community of creators. Every single day, over 1,000 creators reached the milestone of having 1,000 channel subscribers. We are focused on two main areas of investment. First, creating the best video experience that's fast, personalized, searchable, and that just works. We have rolled out many new features to the platform like 360-degree videos, mobile live streams, and support for videos and virtual reality. In regions with limited connectivity, we introduced YouTube Go, which has transparency and control of data usage. Second, we are focused on delivering content that gives fans exactly what they want through offerings like YouTube Music, YouTube Kids and YouTube Red. We have 27 originals, pairing some of the most popular YouTube creators with the biggest directors and producers in Hollywood. One of our new originals called This Is Everything, Gigi Gorgeous about the courageous journey of a transgender YouTube star, officially premiered at Sundance just a few days ago. The popularity of this original content has been successful in driving new subscribers and retaining existing ones, and we'll do more in 2017. Second, our Cloud business is on a terrific upswing. In 2016, we made huge strides building out our product offerings across all areas of Google Cloud Platform or GCP. We routinely hear from customers that we have now moved well beyond table stakes, and we have truly differentiated offerings in four key areas : data analytics and machine learning, security and privacy, tools for application development, and the ability to create connected business platforms, leveraging our recent acquisition of Apigee. Our product advancements across all of GCP, in addition to our increased focus on how we work with the enterprise customers, have enabled us to accelerate growth with new Fortune 2000 customers while also inspiring our current customers to substantially expand their use of GCP. We have also enjoyed strong growth with G Suite, our cloud-based collaboration and productivity applications. G Suite achieved a significant new customer milestone last quarter. More than 3 million paying businesses are now using G Suite to collaborate smartly and securely in the cloud. Our increased success with enterprise customers relates to the unparalleled security and data protection we can provide by offering an entirely cloud-based solution that enables an extremely strong level of production. For both GCP and G Suite, expanding our partner ecosystem continues to be a big focus. And last quarter, the team announced new alliances including Intel, Improbable, Slack, Pivotal and Red Hat. Our customers and partners are appreciating Google Cloud's dramatically accelerated pace of product rollout, as well as our responsiveness to both their needs and aspirations. We look forward to showcasing customers, partners and all of Google Cloud at our next annual Next user conference in March. Third, hardware. We introduced a new family of beautiful hardware devices in October that are made by Google, led by Google Home and our Pixel phone, which featured a Google Assistant built in. We are thrilled with the reception as well as the really happy customers we saw over the holiday season. In particular, Google Home was a very popular present that many people opened on Christmas morning. We are committed to this for the long-term as a great way to bring a beautiful seamless Google experience to people. The early signs are promising and you can expect us to see us expand our offerings thoughtfully. We will also continue working closely with our ecosystem partners to create the best experiences for our users. So those are three of our biggest bets. We are also continuing to push the platforms that are powering our business and our partners' businesses. First, our computing platforms; and second, our advertising platforms. Building powerful open platforms has always been core to Google and our platforms like Android, Chrome and Daydream are creating more innovation, more choice for users and more opportunities for partners. This was on full display at the CES show. There we saw partners like NVIDIA and AirTV introduce new media players based on Android TV. And Casio and New Balance shared their latest Android Wear smartwatches. We also worked closely with Samsung on a new generation of Chromebooks called the Samsung Chromebook Pro and Plus, which are getting great buzz. And in VR, we recently worked with partners like Huawei and ASUS and others to introduce even more new Daydream-ready devices. CES is just a start and there's a lot more coming from our great partners across these platforms in 2017, and we'll continue working hand-in-hand with them to provide the best experiences for our users. We're also investing in ways to help developers succeed using our platforms. Last week, we announced that we are acquiring the Fabric mobile app development platform. This will work alongside our Firebase platform to help developers build better apps and grow their businesses. Since we launched Firebase at I/O, developers have created over 1 million Firebase projects. That's incredible momentum. Google Play helps bring our platforms to life on mobile and beyond, and it's experiencing great momentum. As a piece of trivia, do you know what 2016's top movie was on Google Play? I'll provide the answer in a second. Play had a great quarter with continued growth in our top markets, as well as in emerging markets where user spend grew by more than 70% year-over-year in countries like India, Mexico, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. As the content hub across our growing platforms, the Play team is working hard to help users get the most out of their devices through apps, games and premium content. In Q4, the Play Store launched on Daydream, Android apps became available on Chromebooks and we announced that the Play Store will soon be coming to Android Wear. The platform is also benefiting significantly from machine learning. We recently introduced a new Google Play music experience that makes music streaming smarter and easier to use with better recommendations and playlists. And the answer to my trivia question, the top movie in 2016 was Deadpool. Lastly, I quickly touch on the highlights across our growing advertising businesses. I'm so pleased with the terrific partnerships we have continued to grow this year. We work incredibly closely and deeply with agencies, marketers and publishers worldwide. These relationships owe a lot to the hard work of our fantastic business teams around the world. Our mobile properties like Search, YouTube, Maps, and Google Play are where people turn when they are actively engaged. They are the primetime in the mobile era. We had another successful holiday season where we saw two clear trends. First, this was the year that mobile shopping went truly mainstream, with shoppers using phones as their door to the store to locate nearby retailers, find promotions and comparison-shopped. We recently introduced promoted places in Google Maps, helping advertisers stand out with branded location icons, showing promotions and live updates of popular times right when someone's looking for it. Gap Inc is one example of a company that understands the importance of connecting with consumers on mobile devices. In December, they increased their U.S. mobile search ad spend with us; and as a result, they saw about four times the mapped mobile traffic to their U.S. e-commerce sites compared to December of last year. Second, we saw this season that measurement really matters, and advertisers want reliable ways of understanding where their sales and traffic are coming from and how their campaigns are working. We saw increased use of our popular store visits technology over the holiday shopping season, helping businesses understand how online ads bring customers into their physical stores. In less than two years, store visits have helped advertisers measure over 3 billion store visits globally. Now, turning to our thriving video ads business, led by YouTube. Marketers are seeing terrific success here. Air France used YouTube's TrueView video ads in order to reach valuable business travelers and new customers around the world. By showing engaging videos, highlighting the unique experiences of Air France, they saw more than 100 million views throughout the campaign. Turner Sports partnered with YouTube and DoubleClick for NBA opening night to try a new way to reach fans for the start of the season. We help them deliver real-time video ads with behind the scenes pregame footage uploaded immediately into a YouTube TrueView ad campaign. Thanks to the campaign, they were able to reach 19 million more people across the web with 17% left in ad recall. Speaking of DoubleClick, many news publishers who are using our Accelerated Mobile Pages are now plugging into our Ad Exchange to drive revenue. We are thrilled that most publishers are getting higher click-through rates and effective CPMs with the AMP pages. Before I end, I want to highlight one area that I'm really proud of that Google is truly leading the way. As you know, our data centers from Oklahoma to Chile, to Finland enable our services to be blazing fast and they are what make it possible for Google Photos to offer unlimited storage. But to do all this, they use lots of energy. In 2012, we set the long-term goal to reach 100% renewable energy for our operations. In 2015, we procured enough renewable energy to cover 44% of our total and in 2016 we increased it to more than 50%. I'm really proud that we'll reach 100% renewable energy for global operations in 2017. This is great for the environment and with renewable energy costs declining, it's a huge win for our business results too. With that, I want to thank the Googlers around the world who help make this another exciting quarter. Over to you, Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Sundar, and we will now take your questions. Operator : And our first question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you. I had a question for Sundar. I was wondering, I wanted to focus on the cloud business. When we speak with CIOs about GCP, they highlight in many cases the need for Google to improve upon its enterprise sales strategy. I'm just wondering if you could share with us the changes you've been making in that organization and the goals that you have for the cloud business for 2017. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Heather. As I said in my opening remarks, I do think we have seen tremendous momentum at our partnerships team and how we are approaching. There are a lot of new alliances which I talked about. So now we have teams dedicated to partnering with GSIs and we have a team focused on technology partnerships too. On the GSI front, we announced a new alliance with Accenture last September to create industry solutions for a number of industries including retail. So for me, I think, overall, everywhere I look at we are establishing a world-class enterprise team. Partnerships has been a big focus and I've seen progress there. I think as I said in my remarks, overall, 2017 I expect to have a lot of momentum because we have moved well beyond the table stakes. Now, we are really competing on areas which we think we have differentiation. I talked about data analytics and machine learning, security and so on. So I think we are well-positioned. The momentum when we look at the numbers internally and as well as the traction we see in competitive situations, I definitely think we are going to have a great year and hopefully in the next conference coming up, Diane and team will share a lot more details. Heather Bellini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open. Eric J. Sheridan: Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe first for Sundar. Now that you have this breadth of device ecosystem out there into the marketplace, wanted to know if we get a little bit more color around what your learnings are about the adoption of the device ecosystem, how you're thinking about the go-to-market strategy over the medium to long-term and how we might see sort of an evolution across operating systems? And if I can, maybe one for Ruth, you called out a one-time charge in \u2013 or one-time impact on the number in the quarter. I wanted to get a little more granularity about what went into that one-time expense so we could just sort of factor that into the financials. Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Hey, Eric. I'm assuming when you said the device ecosystem you're talking about how our platforms are working at scale. The thing which I get excited about is computing is increasingly moving rather than just one device which is a dedicated computing device to being there for users in their context and you'll see computing increasingly embedded in many things, and we have a comprehensive strategy. We do want \u2013 we invest in it for the long run. We're improving our computing experiences with machine learning. We expect to be there for users across a device ecosystem, and we're also building things like Google Play to work across all of this so that users can have one coherent experience. I think we see great momentum both across our partner ecosystem, as well as pushing the cutting edge of the experience which is what we strive to do with our own hardware devices. And so I think the end-to-end strategy is working well for us. Ruth Porat : And in terms of, you noted, the one-time item, there are really two that I'm actually going to call out. One was in cost of revenues, I noted that equipment costs were elevated by some one-time charges, and so there was some pressure there. And then the other item that I noted was with respect to our tax rate. I noted that there was slightly elevated tax rate this quarter. It's always affected by the geographic mix of results but we did have a discrete item that affected the U.S. tax rate to make that clear. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. Two questions, please. Again, Ruth, on that $320 million one-time charge, is there any more detail you can provide on that? It seems like a relatively sizable amount. And then, Sundar, if you could talk a little bit about Voice Search, particularly in the home and in the car, and the importance of getting devices out in the marketplace? And the challenge I'll throw to you is, it looks to me like Google devices are being outsold ten-to-one or something like that in most \u2013 in a lot of homes, and it's immaterial now, but it could see in five years that there's is a new Voice Search interaction interface and it's not Google in the home. That could be a real challenge for the company. Thank you. Ruth Porat : So, on the first one trying to be helpful in giving you dimension and impact on cost of sales, but really not much more to add there. I think the other point is that you're thinking about the hardware business. It was gross margin positive. There were just some other variables in there. Sundar Pichai : And, Mark, on Voice Search, we are really excited about it. I think it's a very natural way for users to interact. We think it will be one mode. Users will have many different base by which they interact with computing. And for voice, as you pointed out, we expect voice to work across many different contexts. So we are thinking about it across phones, homes, TVs, cars, and trying to drive that ecosystem that way, and we want Google to be there for users when they need it. And even with Google Home, we just launched it in Q4. We had a very strong quarter there, and we are going to invest a lot in it over 2017. It's very early days. When I look at what it would take to Voice Search well, our years of progress we have done in areas like natural language processing comes into play, and I think there's a lot of work ahead to make all of this work well for users. And this is the core area where we've invested in for the very long term, and so I feel very comfortable about how this will play out in the future. Mark Mahaney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Douglas T. Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. Ruth, you commented on YouTube and addressed some of the non-advertising revenue streams. I was just hoping you could elaborate there a little bit what the goals would be there for your users. And then just to follow up on Mark's question on Voice Search, I understand, Sundar, it's early, but how do you think about the challenges and opportunities from a monetization perspective in Voice? Thanks. Ruth Porat : So on the first question in terms of YouTube, Sundar elaborated on my opening comments. We're really pleased with the ongoing strength we have there. We talked about on prior calls. It's largely driven by Video, primarily TrueView with a strong contribution from DoubleClick Bid Manager, and we are continuing to invest significantly in the business given the importance of supporting the ecosystem of content creators through partner payments, marketing, YouTube Originals, YouTube Spaces. We're broadening the platform. We're investing in the requisite infrastructure given machines and bandwidth required, and Sundar elaborated on some of the upside we see there on the non-ad side. And really the point I was trying to stress consistent with Sundar's comments is, we've got the non-ads momentum here on the YouTube side, and we're also seeing tremendous momentum with cloud, which we're excited about, and the hardware and investing behind those. So those continue to build out the revenue streams as we're looking in the near to medium to long term. Sundar Pichai : And, Doug, I mean, just like Mark's question on Voice Search, I would encourage you to think about it as from a user standpoint, they are looking for information, looking to get things done. The voice queries are one part of the total journey they are on. So when we think about something like the Google Assistant, we think about it as an ongoing conversation with our users across different contexts. So they may ask a question on voice, later when they pick up their phone, they want continuity, so we think of this as an end-to-end thing. And all of this means users engage more with us, more with computing and look for more information, and I think the trends we see are positive. So we think about it from a long-term perspective, and so I see more opportunity than challenge when I think about Voice Search. Douglas T. Anmuth: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Peter C. Stabler: Thanks very much. Another one on YouTube, if I could. Would it be possible to get any sort of metrics around YouTube Red and how the subscription business has been progressing, realizing you're not going to be providing that every quarter but that you do occasionally give us some sort of benchmarks in the market? Thanks so much. Ruth Porat : Well, at this point, we've launched in five countries. We're pleased with the early success and it's still early days, it takes a while to build a subscription business here. And I'll pass it to Sundar for additional commentary. Sundar Pichai : Look, I mean, I think \u2013 I would think about it as, we are investing a lot in developing this premium experience in a way of YouTube Brand, YouTube Music, and we do offer it across Google Play Music as well. You will see us invest more, more countries, more original content, and we'll bring together the experiences we have over the course of this year. So it's even more compelling for users. But we are seeing tractions with the rate of signups. We're not disclosing specific numbers, but I'm excited at the progress there. Peter C. Stabler: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, just to go back to YouTube, I appreciate the color around the content. I'd be curious to hear about how you think philosophically about partnering with more premium content players to maybe drive even higher engagement and an even better YouTube experience. And then the second one, if you kind of step back in your Mobile Search business and the verticals, the innovation you've had at retail and travel with Shopping and Hotel Finder, I guess I'd be curious to hear about where you see the biggest potential for more improvements in certain verticals for an even more relevant and higher search result experience over the next years. Thanks. Sundar Pichai : On your first question, look, I mean, we think of YouTube again as an ecosystem. We are trying to connect creators with users, form a community. And so, we work hard to bring more premium content. We already work with TV networks and their individual shows, whether it's a late-night show like James Corden or Jimmy Fallon, afternoon shows like Ellen, sports programming like NBA and NFL. For example, sports is one of the most popular verticals. We have hundreds of sports partnership in place, and so we'll continue to invest that way and drive the premium content there. On the second one, we do look at the end-to-end experience, look at what are the kinds of tasks which users are trying to get done. Mobile raises the bar if you want to provide those deeper experiences for users. And so, I generally think local is a big area. We have strong assets there with Maps, and so we think about how we can improve the local experience a lot more for users. So for example, within local areas like dining, we work closely with our partners to make that better. So we get it at a pretty granular level and we try to hit all the areas. And so, I think you'll see progress in all these areas over the next few years. Brian Nowak : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura. Your line is now open. Anthony DiClemente, CFA: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Yeah, just on YouTube, I'd love to hear about the pricing and then also about AdMob (44:47). So, is there anything you could highlight on ad format? And specifically, we noticed that recently you're enabling marketers to target YouTube ads based on search, and so I just want to hear about that strategy. And maybe relatedly, the recently announced non-skippable YouTube ads format. Would love to kind of hear about that. Thanks for taking my questions. Sundar Pichai : Look, overall, I would say there's been a \u2013 been very pleased with how the team has been driving innovation in ad formats and ad experiences. I think video advertising is in its very early days. We see whenever we (45:32) innovation phase, and advertiser response to all these new formats has been really positive. So for example a bumper ads are six second video format that we launched. It's already being used by thousands of accounts, including major brands like Universal Pictures and Netflix. On your question around how we think about the experience across screens, it's really important to understand users consume YouTube across screens, and so they experience consistent experience. And similarly, from an advertising standpoint, we want that to be thoughtful for users, more relevant across screens as well. And so that's the context in which we do this. We give users control over that experience. But I do think as part of these changes, advertisers can get more detailed insights from their YouTube campaigns across devices so they can better understand the impact of their marketing campaigns. So I think it's early days, but I think it's the right direction, and I think we will see good traction from it. Anthony DiClemente, CFA: Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of Moffett. Your line is now open. Michael B. Nathanson: Thanks. I have two, one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, just picking on the YouTube questions, there was a report that YouTube and CBS had agreed on an agreement to distribute CBS on YouTube. Can you talk a bit if that has actually happened? And if so, what's the opportunity to partner with networks and how will that evolve over time? Sundar Pichai : Look, I can't comment on any specific discussions, but I said a little bit earlier we are constantly working with partners across these areas. We work very closely with TV networks on their individual shows. It's a big part of the YouTube experience. And so you will see us work hard to make these partnerships deeper and bring more content to our users. So maybe I'll leave it at that. Michael B. Nathanson: Okay. And then for Ruth, you mentioned programmatic drove the network members' revenue growth this quarter. If you look at fourth quarter this year and last year, there seems to be an acceleration in Q4 and then it comes back. I wonder what's happening seasonally to that revenue line that drives fourth quarter up so much. Ruth Porat : Well, as we've talked about on prior calls, there are obviously a number of businesses within the network line, and a number of things went right this quarter. I wouldn't extrapolate from it. As you know, there can be some seasonality, and Q1 is typically lower than the fourth quarter. I think the main point is that the programmatic business continues to be a strong contributor with significant growth reflecting the ongoing advertiser adoption just given the overall efficiency of programmatic and improved targeting and the benefit of inventory growth. And so the story, it's pretty much unchanged. We continue to see the growth in programmatic offset by declines in the more traditional businesses. And when you're looking at the quarter-over-quarter, we are continuing to see things like the impact of policy changes and timing of product launches. But I just think that there were a number of things that went well this quarter. Q3 was a bit lighter so that's been flatter quarter-over-quarter comparison, but I wouldn't extrapolate from this. Michael B. Nathanson: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Wondering, Sundar, if you can just give us a sense on the Pixel phone hardware opportunity to kind of build direct mobile distribution and capture hardware margin, and how you think about that versus the potential disruption that having your own handset at a bigger scale could cause in the Android ecosystem? Do you think this is something that could get meaningful market share without disrupting the ecosystem? And then a second follow-up related to this would be on the Pixel phones with Google Assistant having been built uniquely into the core of the experience, is there anything you're learning as the usage of that increases? Is it driving a step-function, increasing engagement with the hardware/software integration? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Look, I mean, we are in the early days. I think it's really important when you work on a platform you have to drive it forward as we've always done by putting out the state-of-the-art and I think it especially gets important in the vision we have for computing where users are going to use it across many different contexts. And so to do that end-to-end experience, it spans devices. So I think it's important for us to work at the intersection of hardware, software and services and so that's how we think about it. And I think we invest a lot more in our ecosystem and I mentioned earlier, I'm incredibly excited at the lineup we have for this year from our partners. So we do both and we are very thoughtful about it. I think the scale at which we are doing it shows it's working and I'm confident we'll be able to strike that balance well. In terms of Google Assistant on the Pixel along with how search works, I think definitely it gives us a way to iterate and move faster and make sure it's working better for users. Our thesis is that as we make it easier for users to have Google at their fingertips across what they are doing and including many modes whether they are typing or asking Google a question, we find that it overall benefits. And so it will be a long-term trend but I think our earlier studies (51:44) show that our intuition is right there and so we'll continue approaching it that way. Lloyd Walmsley : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Okay. Thank you. So, Sundar, you called out Google Play growth in emerging markets in your prepared remarks. So I thought from a revenue size standpoint it would be one of the big bets you would highlight but \u2013 so I'm wondering how you view your own Instant Apps as well as the products or their operators to let consumers try apps either in a messenger product or on an HTML5 environment? Do these innovations present an opportunity or a challenge for you at the Play franchise? And secondarily, it seems that the recurring theme in your prepared remarks is how AI is making the consumer products better. Is there anything you can share with us as to how it may be making monetization better? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : So, on Google Play, for me what makes it work well is just with the vision of computing we have been talking about how it works across contexts. You need an ecosystem. You need an apps and services ecosystem to work cohesively across all of this and that's what I like about how we are approaching Google Play and you saw us this quarter \u2013 see Google Play work beyond Android phones. They're coming to Chromebooks. They work in Daydream, they work in Android Wear and so it's an end-to-end thing which works well. And that's the most important thing so that as a user, you know whether you're engaging with a game or a TV show that you can reliably get it across your computing experiences. And we'll adapt and I think we will drive innovation simply to go where what's right for users and developers and so be it Instant Apps or driving better HTML5 experiences. We invest in all that and I think we'll move it all forward. On your second question about how machine learning and AI is improving our monetization, it definitely, I mean, just like we had many, many launches last year which involve machine learning being incorporated across Google including our monetization products. Our monetization teams at Google have always been at the cutting edge of what I would call as machine learning techniques from early days on. And so they are doing it. It is early days now but I think we already have really new insights and so we'll bake it in over the course of the year. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Sena of Evercore. Your line is now open. Kenneth Sena : Hi. Just maybe another question on YouTube. Can you expound a decision this quarter to remove third-party cookie and Pixel activity? It looks as though you're favoring something much more identity-based and maybe you could just think through the \u2013 or explain a bit about the impetus there and maybe the trade-offs for marketers, that would be great. Thank you very much. Sundar Pichai : I spoke about it a bit earlier, but I think it's important that we evolve all of this from a user-centric standpoint, and users have an identity, they have preferences. And so for example, think about it from a user standpoint. If they don't like one particular ad or they don't want to see an ad from a particular advertiser. They want it to work across their experience, across their cross-device experience. So we think about it that way, and so we are working towards a long-term experience that's right for users and which I think will make sense for advertisers reaching users too. So I think we are evolving it jointly and thoughtfully, giving users control. And I think that's the right way to approach it over time. Kenneth Sena : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Thank you. I'd like to ask first a question about ad coverage and click rates. Maybe just your thoughts on potential to increase ad coverage now that you have a fourth link. Is there still room to help ad clicks with coverage increases? And just as you think out to this year, how do you feel about the innovation pipeline in ads? Do you think there's a lot more you can still do in Search? And then two, housekeeping for you, Ruth. Maybe you could just let us know what kind of equipment was written off so we can think about how recurring that might be, and any comment on the buyback activity in the quarter? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On our monetization efforts, our teams always have been very thoughtful about planning not just for the short-term but planning for the long-term. We don't start the year thinking our plan is to increase ad coverage or something like that, right? We have many experiments in the pipeline. We see how user behavior is evolving and in conjunction with that, we evolve our ad experience. So for example, as people use mobile, scroll more, it's to track the user behavior changes, and we adapt to that in a very, very disciplined way. So last year, you saw us maybe increase coverage in a certain way. For example, in desktop, we removed ads on the right-hand side, and so we take a very holistic approach to these things. For me, I do think we have a lot of headroom ahead. I still look at where most of transactions happen and how that secular transformation is underway, and so I think we see we have a lot more headroom left. And Ruth, I'll pass... Ruth Porat : And \u2013 yeah, in terms of your second question, really not much more to add on the first part. In terms of the buyback, we weren't able to commence it in the fourth quarter due to trading restrictions but we do look forward to getting back into the market. Justin Post : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. Ellen West : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2017 call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

Later we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ellen West : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. While you were waiting, you were listening to the infectious song \"Diggy,\" by Spencer Ludwig. Spencer is a new, exciting artist on Warner Bros. Records who is touring Europe this month. You have heard his trumpet stylings when he performed with Capital Cities on \"Safe and Sound.\" Be sure to check out his official \"Diggy\" video on his YouTube channel. Now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2016, filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumption as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Ellen. Our revenues of $24.8 billion in the first quarter demonstrate our broad-based strength globally, with revenues up 22% year on year. In constant currency, our consolidated revenues grew 24% versus 1Q 2016. Growth in advertising revenues was again driven by mobile search, with ongoing strength in YouTube and programmatic. We also had substantial growth in other revenues from Play, hardware, and Cloud. Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Given the obvious seasonality in Q4, I will focus on year-over-year changes in our results. As a reminder, I will review our results on a GAAP basis, which includes stock-based compensation for operating income, net income, and earnings per share. Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take questions. Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenues were $24.8 billion, up 22% year over year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year over year of $304 million or $87 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenues grew 24% year over year. Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, as you can see in our press release, we've enhanced the geographic split to give you more insight into our businesses around the world. We are now reporting our revenues in four regions : the U.S., EMEA \u2013 namely Europe, Middle East, and Africa \u2013 APAC or Asia Pacific, and Other Americas, which encompasses Canada and Latin America. To help you with the transition to our new geographic reporting, we're also sharing the U.K. revenues for this quarter. These groupings align more closely with how we manage our businesses and also with the major currencies that affect our results. The results by region highlight the strength of our business around the globe. U.S. revenues were up 25% year over year to $11.8 billion. EMEA revenues were $8.1 billion, up 13% year over year. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 19%. U.K.-reported revenues continue to reflect the ongoing weakness of the British pound, with revenues up 5% year over year to $2 billion on a reported basis, yet up 16% in fixed FX terms. APAC revenues were $3.6 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 26% in fixed FX terms, reflecting strength of the Australian dollar and yen. Other Americas revenues, which include results from Canada and Latin America, were up 34% versus last year to $1.3 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 29% year over year, with fixed FX growth reflecting strength in the Brazilian real. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, were $9.8 billion, up 28% year on year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.2 billion, up 34% year over year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses \u2013 specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, as well as hardware-related costs reflecting the continued strong performance of our new Made by Google product line. Operating expenses were $8.4 billion in the quarter, up 15% year over year. Year-on-year comparisons in part reflect the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle, with a half-year grant in Q1, which enables us to move to a single annual compensation cycle. As discussed last quarter, this affects the timing of stock-based compensation but does not affect the overall size of the SBC expense for the year. The year-on-year increase is therefore more sizable in Q1 and Q2 compared to previous years, with less of a year-on-year impact in both Q3 and Q4. More specifically, stock-based compensation totaled $2 billion, up 34% year over year. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 73,992, up 1,939 people from last quarter. The growth in consolidated head count was somewhat muted by an internal reallocation of people from Fiber to Google. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count growth was in Cloud, consistent with the priority we place on this business. Operating income was $6.6 billion, up 23% versus last year. The operating margin was 27%. Other income and expense was $251 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 20% for the first quarter. Net income was $5.4 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $7.73. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $2.5 billion. Operating cash flow was $9.5 billion, with free cash flow of $7 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $92.4 billion, of which approximately $55.7 billion or 60% is held overseas. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $24.5 billion, up 22% year over year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $17.4 billion in the quarter, up 21% year over year. The biggest contributor to growth again this quarter was mobile search, reflecting the secular shift to mobile due to the greater utility of smartphones for users and advertisers, but obviously also benefiting from our focus on continuously enhancing features and functionality. YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising. Network revenues were $4 billion, up 9% year on year, reflecting the ongoing strong growth of programmatic and AdMob. Results benefited from a slower rate of decline in the traditional Network business than in prior periods, although it continues to be negatively affected by both the ongoing shift by advertisers to programmatic and our ongoing policy efforts. Other revenues for Google were $3.1 billion, up 49%. Last quarter we talked about our bigger investment areas, and you can see the strong momentum here, reflecting contributions from each of Play, hardware, and Cloud. Specifically, Play benefited from both broad-based app strength but also from all the work we have done in areas such as direct carrier billing, which helps more people globally access and buy their favorite apps and games on Google Play. Hardware continues to have strong growth and remains an important area for us, with our family of products extending geographically. Google Cloud continues to drive sizable growth, with Google Cloud Platform remaining one of the fastest-growing businesses across Alphabet. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.6 billion, or 22% of total advertising revenues, and up 22% year over year. The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenues, as well as Network TAC as a percentage of Network revenues, reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year over year as a result of an increase in the Sites TAC rate, driven by the shift to mobile, which was again partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites, which carries lower TAC. Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 40% year over year. Operating income, including the impact of SBC, was $7.6 billion, up 22% versus last year, and the operating margin was 31%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction. Turning to Other Bets. For the first quarter, Other Bets revenues were $244 million, primarily generated by Nest, Verily, and Fiber. Operating loss, including the impact of SBC, was $855 million for the first quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $170 million, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q 2016. Let me conclude. First, we've benefited from our team's innovations that continually enhance our advertising business, as evidenced by the ongoing growth of Sites revenues. On a dollar basis, the increase in Sites revenues reflects the healthy growth in mobile search. As we discussed in prior calls, even though mobile revenue growth requires an increasing investment in the mobile ecosystem in the form of higher TAC, our strength in mobile search is adding meaningfully to profit dollars. Second, the strong performance in our advertising business allows us to take bigger bets within Google to fuel the growth of additional revenue streams, including those from Cloud, hardware, and YouTube subscription offerings. Cloud is one of our most important strategic priorities given the scale of opportunity in a rapidly evolving sector and the fact that the requirements for success align with many of our strengths. We will continue to invest here for the long-term opportunity. Similarly, hardware remains an exciting growth opportunity for us, and you've seen the early indicators again this quarter. Finally in Other Bets, we're determining the size and pace of investment appropriate to each bet, given their stage of development and achievements against milestones. We expect to increase near-term investment in certain areas while continuing to calibrate the pace of investment in others as they move along a path to commercialization. For example, as I hope you saw earlier this week, Waymo announced it has commenced a trial of its self-driving cars in the Phoenix area. Waymo also announced it is expanding its fleet of minivans to support this trial. These actions reflect the tremendous accomplishment of our team over many years, leading with safety, and now beginning to bring the experience to consumers. I will now turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Ruth. It's been a terrific start to the year. This quarter was notable for the fantastic momentum across our products. Advances for the Google Assistant, the launch of YouTube TV, and lots of new features launched at our Google Cloud Next event. In the next few weeks, there's much more to come. We'll host our annual developer conference, Google I/O; our advertising event, Google Marketing Next; and our YouTube upfront, Brandcast. I hope you'll join us. Today I'll discuss three things. First, how our continued investments in machine learning are fueling innovation across Google, and particularly how it's helping drive our core mission of providing access to information for everyone. Second, progress in three of our biggest bets : YouTube, Cloud, and hardware. And, third, our platforms, such as Android and our advertising platform, which power businesses and computing experiences around the world. Now, turning first to machine learning and access to information. I'm really happy with how we are transitioning to an AI-first company. The Google Assistant is one of our first steps towards that future. This quarter, we brought the Assistant to your wrist with Android Wear 2.0, announced that it'll soon come to Android TV, and began rolling it out to hundreds of millions of people with Android phones running Nougat and Marshmallow. We also continue to announce new integration partners for the Google Assistant, so you can now ask it to do things like dim the living room lights. Stay tuned for more to come. Advances in machine learning are helping us make many Google products better. One example from this quarter is the launch of parking predictions in Google Maps. Beyond that, we continue to set the pace in machine learning and AI research. We introduced a new technique for training deep neural networks on mobile devices called Federated Learning. This technique enables people to run a shared machine learning model while keeping their underlying data stored locally on mobile phones. DeepMind is bringing AlphaGo to China in May, pairing AI with the world's best players at the Future of Go Summit. And it's very exciting to see the incredible things that developers and researchers are building on the TensorFlow platform. There are more than 6,000 GitHub projects and counting. Search remains at the heart of our mission to make information available to everyone, and we are laser-focused on making Search even better. In March, we introduced tappable shortcuts in Google Search to help you easily access topics you care about, like sports, entertainment, and weather. And, earlier this week, to improve our results further, we introduced algorithmic ranking improvements, as well as easier ways for people to provide better (17:28) feedback in autocomplete and Featured Snippets. Last week, we made big improvements to one of our longest-standing and most loved products, Google Earth. It's really beautiful and easy to use. Now you can experience breathtaking locations in virtual reality, like the top of Table Mountain in South Africa. Moving on to three of our biggest bets : YouTube, Cloud, and hardware. First, YouTube, where we continue to see extraordinary growth and opportunities. People around the world are watching more content on YouTube than ever before. In 2016, we passed a big milestone that continues to grow. Every day, users watch over a billion hours on YouTube. YouTube continues to be the most popular destination for online video globally, and we are focused on building awesome experiences. This quarter we announced YouTube TV, which offers live TV from major broadcast and cable networks, a cloud-based DVR without storage limits, and streaming on all of your devices. We have launched in five cities so far, and the positive feedback from customers has been really incredible. Our destination for family and kids' content, called YouTube Kids, also recently celebrated its second birthday. There have been more than 30 billion video views in the app to date. Next, our growing Cloud business. Our Google Cloud Next conference in March was a great opportunity to highlight core areas of differentiation for GCP, like new security products and the recognition that we had the highest cloud availability in 2016, according to CloudHarmony. It was attended by five times as many people as last year. We also demonstrated new machine learning services and announced our acquisition of Kaggle, the largest community of data centers focused on machine learning and AI. We introduced dozens of new products, including Spanner, a database optimized for distributed computing that can reliably update data across multiple data centers. And our G Suite team introduced a major expansion of or collaboration platform with Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. To give you a taste of the kinds of large enterprise customers and partners we are now working with across GCP, we were joined on stage by major companies like HSBC, Home Depot, Schlumberger, and SAP, as well as large G Suite customers, including Colgate-Palmolive. We continue to see tremendous momentum in education, where our products are leading the industry, thanks to their simplicity, security, and low cost. Chromebooks are now used by more than 20 million teachers and students, and more than 70 million people actively use G Suite for Education. Over the last several months, we have noticed a change in the types of conversations that Diane and her team are having with customers. Increasingly, we are being asked to partner for mission-critical projects and full migrations, moving data from on-prem data centers to the cloud. We are seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business. On to our next big bet, hardware. Last year, we debuted a beautiful new family of hardware devices, including the Pixel, Google Home, and Google Wifi, bringing together the best of Google across hardware and software. We are finding that people who buy products like Pixel and Google Home are not only incredibly happy with their purchase but also very likely to recommend it to others. Sales continues to be strong, and we are actively working to bring these great devices to more people around the world. Just a few weeks ago, we announced that Google Home and Google Wifi are now available in the U.K. Speaking of Google Home, last week we made it possible for up to six people to connect their accounts to one Google Home, and thanks to a leading voice recognition technology, it can recognize who's speaking to it. It's really a game changer. And, finally, we are continuing to invest in our computing and advertising platforms. Our platforms have had great success over the years, creating incredible user experiences, as well as real opportunities and economic success for partners, creators, and developers around the globe. To illustrate, in the past three years in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa alone, we paid out more than $15 billion to our publisher, creator, and app developer partners. That's across AdSense, YouTube, and Google Play, and it doesn't even include device sales by many hardware partners who build on Android. There's tremendous momentum in the Android ecosystem, as evidenced by the great reception of the beautiful Samsung Galaxy S8. We'll have much more to say at I/O next month. In March, we introduced the first developer preview of Android O, featuring improvements for battery life, notifications, and picture-in-picture display. The Android platform is also seeing great growth in emerging markets. In 2016, nearly 300 million new users adopted Android devices from countries like India and Brazil. We also announced the public launch of Android Wear 2.0, with two new flagship watches from LG. And thanks to partnerships with major brands like TAG and Fossil, there'll be more than 20 different Android Wear watches available this year, doubling the number from last year. Our virtual reality platform Daydream, which debuted almost a year ago, continues to gain traction with more devices and more great content, like VR video. More than 50% of time in Daydream is video consumption, and YouTube VR is Daydream's number 1 app by time spent. Lastly, I'll talk about the highlights and trends we are seeing across our growing advertising business, where there are still enormous opportunities. As you can see from our results, we continue to experience remarkable growth worldwide. Not only are existing advertisers choosing to spend more as they see the value of our ads, but many more businesses around the world are just getting started on our ad platforms, from India to Brazil and many more. Our momentum continues to be driven by the shift to mobile. Our great properties, like Search, Maps, YouTube, and Google Play, are the prime time for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested. We have increased our investment in machine learning in our advertising business, with efforts like Smart Bidding, where our systems predict the performance of an ad and adjust advertisers' bids in real time to maximize their results. Two areas where we are seeing particular strength are retailers and app developers. Mobile has transformed the shopping experience. In the past year, local shopping queries have increased by 45%, and the number of retailers that provide us with their local inventory feeds has doubled. Our investments in innovative ad formats, include targeting and better measurement, are really helping retailers, who see us as an ally in their corner. Brands like Williams-Sonoma have seen a 70% increase in mobile sales year over year, with Google mobile shopping ads playing a big part. Secondly, developers use us to help their apps stand out from the crowd. Thanks to our app install advertising products, developers have already driven more than 5 billion app downloads. Our flagship product here, Universal App Campaigns, allows developers to easily promote their apps across Google Search, Play, YouTube, and the Google Display Network. It incorporates machine learning to improve campaigns and drive great results for advertisers. We recently announced new innovations at the Game Developers Conference, including an interactive playable ad format in Universal App Campaigns that lets users play a lightweight version of your game right in the ad. It's really effective in driving installs from engaged users. Now on to our growing video advertising business. Brands love the reach and engagement that they get across YouTube, along with the effectiveness of formats like TrueView skippable ads and our new bumper ads, which are snackable six-second videos that drive incremental reach and frequency. We recently did research on more than 120 bumper ad campaigns, and the data showed that they drove a significant lift in brand awareness and ad recall. Under Armour used both bumper ads and TrueView together to promote a new product launch recently, resulting in double the lift in product interest among people who saw both ads compared to those who only saw the TrueView ad. We work incredibly hard to create the best environment for brands on YouTube. The cornerstone of our offering is Google Preferred, which allow brands to advertise against the top 5% of our content. We also announced new safeguards for advertisers through a combination of updated ad policies and enforcement, new default settings around where ads can appear, improved controls for advertisers, and third-party brand safety reporting. Brands and agencies understand how hard we work to create the safest possible environment. We do this by also being very careful to ensure YouTube's innovative creators can earn money to support their unique and popular content. We've been actively engaged in conversations with clients about the new tools and controls we are providing, and we are having very productive discussions ahead of Brandcast next week. Finally, programmatic advertising. As marketers continue to shift towards programmatic ad buying, our DoubleClick platform makes it easy for them to effectively reach the right audiences. We've been focusing on making more inventory available to more advertisers, especially premium inventory. For instance, we recently expanded our Programmatic Guaranteed reservation product to advertisers globally, and we made traditional TV inventory available to buy in DoubleClick Bid Manager. So that's a run-through of some highlights for the quarter. Thanks to every Googler for making Google such an exciting and inspiring place to work every day. Over the last few days, we have had Take Your Child to Work Day at Google, which is one of my favorite events of the year. We have had thousands of excited, screaming kids running around the Googleplex, which is how I feel some days, too. What motivates us at Google is building the technologies that'll be central to all of their computing experiences, to give them opportunities to learn, to be heard, and to succeed. And with that, I will hand it back over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Sundar, and we will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Douglas T. Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. I had two. First, just, you talked about Cloud as a huge strategic priority. Could you just talk more about the go-to-market strategy for GCP and how you plan on building up the reseller channel there going forward? And then secondly, Sundar, on Waymo, I was curious on some of your thoughts. I know it's early, but on the timing for Waymo to become commercially viable. And then what are the key guideposts and requirements along the way? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On the Cloud stuff, talking about go-to-market, as Ruth said in Q1, our largest growth in head count and CapEx was in Cloud. So we are thrilled with the progress we have made there since Diane arrived, building our world-class sales, marketing, and engineering teams. The heavy lifting, I would say, is around how we meet enterprises in the market. We have reorganized so we have one face to the customer. So it's not just sales reps. We've been thoughtful about how we have built out the entire go-to-market organization. So we created two new areas that customers can now take advantage of. One is the office of the CTO, which helps customers solve difficult technical problems. And the second is our Advanced Solutions Lab, where customers can get help from machine learning experts. And on top of that, now we have a phenomenal support team that helps keeps customers' applications up and running. So I think what we have done \u2013 our approach is one Google. When a customer sings up for Google Cloud, they get more than GCP and G Suite. They have access to the ads and analytics teams, YouTube teams, and resources within our organization. So I think it's coming along quite well. Ruth Porat : And then on your question on Waymo, we view Waymo as a great example of a graduate from X that's addressing a sizable problem and builds off of tremendous technology here. We started with safety; we remain a leader in safety. And we continue to view that as the foundation for success. And at this point we're exploring many options enabling ridesharing, personal-use vehicles, logistics, and deliveries, and we also see opportunities to work with cities to address public transportation. So the announcements that we made this week are a continuation of the progress the team has made. We do have a strong relationship with Fiat Chrysler, increased our car order, given the opportunity. They have been our primary partner to date, but to note we're in active discussions with others around the globe. And then I think, importantly, the trial in the Phoenix area is something that's been in the works for some time, and we do look forward for that trial. So it's still in the early days, and we're excited about the upside from Waymo. Douglas T. Anmuth: Great. Thank you both. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you. I also wanted to ask a question about Cloud as a follow-up. I was just wondering, Sundar, if you could share with us what's the feedback been since Next from your Cloud customers? And could you share with us how qualitatively \u2013 something so we can gauge just kind of whether this business is starting to see an inflection in growth or not? Is there anything you could give us qualitatively about how the pipeline is building in this area? And I guess just what I'm interested in is also the types of conversations you're having with customers now versus maybe six years ago. I'm sorry \u2013 six months ago. Sorry about that. Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Time flies fast. Next was \u2013 having done Google I/O many, many times, I was surprised to see the scale and growth of Next from even last year to this year. We had five many times as people. I think everyone really appreciated seeing large customers, very sophisticated customers, like HSBC, eBay, Colgate-Palmolive, et cetera, discussing use of Google Cloud, GCP. Along with Diane, I did follow-up lunches with a set of people, and so the feedback has been very positive. People sense our commitment to the area. They understand the pace at which we are investing. They see that we are committed to machine learning and AI at a deep level. They appreciate how we are open-sourcing things. Facetalk was extraordinarily well-received. They are noticing the acquisitions we are making, Kaggle and AppBridge are a couple of acquisitions which happened around that time. So all that, all those details, I think clearly made an impact. I just spoke about the go-to-market progress, and I think that's beginning to get traction as well. In general, I think there is a very strong recognition that we are have pivoted to being a deep enterprise company, and our conversations are very strategic. We are engaging at the highest levels within companies. And so, overall, I can see qualitative lead and momentum there. When we are in the middle of deals, we find we are very competitive, and there are areas where customers perceive us as best-in-class already. So it's been exciting to see. Heather Bellini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open. Eric J. Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, you mentioned Google Assistant in your remarks. Wanted to know, what have you seen in terms of consumer adoption of Google Assistant, whether at the Pixel level or the Google Home level? What does it give you in terms of sense of how people want to interact with the Assistant? What it might do in terms of putting artificial intelligence capabilities down to the consumer level and improve consumer experiences over the next couple years? Thanks so much for the color. Sundar Pichai : Good question, Eric. Pixel is a good example, because I think it's the place where we do the leading work here. And how we presented Google Assistant and the Pixel \u2013 well-received, both qualitatively in terms of consumer feedback we get, quantitatively in terms of how we see people using voice, how we see people interacting with overall Google Assistant and Search better. So we find that when we drive the Assistant experience well, it works overall in helping people engage with Google at a broader level. It's always surprising to us \u2013 we always said, even with Search, every single day we see so many new types of queries. When you bring the assistant into the mix, you start getting even more different tips of queries, and queries are more casual, more conversational. And so over time I think it starts breaking down the barriers to computing people have, and that's what makes it very, very exciting. Now, artificial intelligence will help us push all that further. Just to give an example, we will make text to speech much, much better over time. Yesterday, we announced our Neural Machine Translation is launching in nine new languages. So all that starts accruing to the Assistant, and I think we'll overall improve the customer experience pretty dramatically. We'll talk about all this a lot more at Google I/O, so stay tuned. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Great, thanks. Two questions, please. One on YouTube and one on Google Maps. Sundar or Ruth, there was some press about some of the pushback or some of the controversy around content and advertising and monetization of that. Are those technical problems that can be solved over time? Or is just the magnitude or the volume of content in trying to keep bad content off the site, however that's defined, and keep it from being monetized, is that an ongoing technology challenge or did you already find a solution? Then did you see any material impact to advertisers' budget interest with YouTube? And then if you could also comment briefly on Google Maps. This is one of those massive properties that you've owned that's highly used by almost everybody, and I think the monetization to date has been really de minimis. Is there anything that's changed for you in terms of your thought about the ability to monetize Google Maps over time? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On advertising and monetization in YouTube, we talked a bit about it. We have taken it pretty seriously, and we are taking significant steps. And obviously as part of doing that, we have brought new technical solutions into place. Machine learning is a great example of it. It helps us enforce \u2013 as we improve our policies, it helps us enforce it better. And we are in early days, so as machine learning gets better, I think we'll be able to do all of this even better and create that virtuous cycle. Overall, I'm pretty confident at the rate at which we have made progress. And we're going to continue investing a lot here. It is super important to us that this ecosystem works well. It matters for advertisers. It matters for content creators. And so we take that responsibility very seriously. I would say advertisers have clearly noticed all the improvements we have made. Our conversations with them are very, very positive, and so I'm pretty optimistic about how we'll continue to make progress here. On Google Maps, your question is \u2013 it's a good question. I get surprised at, for a property which we had launched many, many years ago, even now it's showing strong growth, especially in emerging markets. Maps is an integral part of your mobile phone. And users get more interested in the real world around them with AR and so on, I think Maps will continue to play a bigger role. We take a long-term view. It's already impacting monetization very significantly for us with local search. So today, when you use Google, a lot of the information we are able to do is because of Google Maps. But I'm sure you've noticed changes within Google Maps over the past few months. If you open Google Maps, you're traveling or you're out on a Friday evening, we start surfacing a lot more interesting information about what you can do, places to eat, and so on. So those are beginning to get good feedback from users, and I think that gives us an opportunity to add value there over time as well. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Sundar. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Peter C. Stabler: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to follow up on Mark's question on the local opportunity. Assuming that you agree it's a large one, what kind of steps are you taking to educate the smaller businesses out there on the opportunities you have? You've mentioned increasing take-up of local inventory ads. We understand that. But more generally, a go-to-market strategy on how you reach the millions of SMBs out there in terms of educating them on the growing opportunities on a local basis. Thanks so much. Sundar Pichai : It's a great question. And I think there's a lot of opportunity for us. Today we have many touch points. Obviously people \u2013 we reach out to SMBs, they want to get listed in Search and in Maps. AdWords Express has been a big part of how they want to advertise on our platforms. We obviously provide things like Google Apps to SMBs. So we have a lot of touch points, and internally we are beginning to do a much better job of reaching out and having a more thoughtful go-to-market approach. I think there's a lot more work there, but the rate at which we are seeing advertisers \u2013 small, medium businesses \u2013 on our platform has been growing very, very strongly as well. So indications are that it's already currently working at scale. We have millions and millions of SMBs on our platform, and the number continues to grow very well. But you'll see us invest a lot more here in the years ahead. Peter C. Stabler: Thank you, Sundar. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit more about the retail search category? Any high-level commentary on consumer search-query trends in retail, either an area of strength or otherwise? And then you talked about the real-time local-inventory integration, but, Sundar, I'd be curious if you could talk about any opportunities or areas of innovation in the retail search space that you see to really continue to improve users' retail-search experience. Thanks for the color. Sundar Pichai : I think obviously when we see what users are looking for in mobile, how shopping is evolving, it's an area we're continuously working on. I've been happy to see the evolution in our shopping experiences. Retail overall also happens to be an amazing category for us from a Google Cloud standpoint, so in some ways we are developing deeper partnerships with retailers around the world. And so as we start doing that, and I think as we get a better understanding of their inventory and the data, how we can translate all of that into our core experience is a bit of the work ahead. I think that's what excites us about the longer term. Shorter term, I think it's a space we continue to invest in. We are actually seeing strong trends in that category. Brian Nowak : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Daniel Salmon : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. I've got two questions on YouTube for Sundar. First, this morning on the earnings call, WPP's CEO, Sir Martin Sorrell, noted that the company is being very responsive, I think were his words, to some of the recent concerns that we'd talked about earlier in the Q&A. We've also seen some official policy changes, things like that. I'd be interested, Sundar, to hear a little bit more about some of the softer outreach that you may be doing, thinking of Philipp Schindler's team, maybe the agency relations team, and how your people are reaching out and connecting with their clients, especially as you go into Brandcast? And then the second follow-up on YouTube was, I'd be interested to hear your updated thoughts on the role of the YouTube Spaces. I think Ruth's prepared comments on CapEx mentioned some investments in production equipment. I don't know if that is related to that or something related to Cloud, but it does seem that the Spaces remain an important part of YouTube and continue to grow. And I'd love to hear an updated view on them. Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On the first part, (43:20) one of the things I've noticed is the depth of relationships we have with our advertisers was very evident to me as we went through this over the past few weeks. I would estimate \u2013 I think Philipp Schindler's team has probably made literally thousands and thousands of calls, in-person conversations, and I think that deep relationship is what allowed us to respond thoughtfully. And I think the feedback from our partners were very positive and constructive, and I think we are evolving overall to a better place. And so I think to me that shows the long-term investments you make in these relationships, et cetera, plays well at times like these. And Brandcast is again an important touch point, and the excitement ahead of Brandcast, both internally and from our partners, all has the right indications for us. On YouTube on Spaces, I visited the YouTube Space. I took my family to the YouTube Space in New York, and we had a lot of fun. Our creators love these spaces. They are something we are thoughtfully building out. They have a good return on investment for us, but we are very thoughtful about it. And I don't think that's a major factor in any of the CapEx we talked about here. Ruth Porat : Yeah, Exactly. In the CapEx, when I talked about production equipment, we were talking about machines, and that was the primary driver here. We're investing more machines given both our growing requirements and the higher cost of the new generation of machines and accelerators. So that will be more expensive in the short term, and we are continuing to build our inventory. But it does increase performance, and we believe reduce total cost of ownership in the longer term, so just to clarify that on CapEx. Daniel Salmon : Okay, great. Thank you both for the color. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is now open. Ross Sandler : Great. I'm not sure if this is for Sundar or Ruth, but a question about regulatory. You guys recently reached an agreement in Russia around the Android bundling issue, where you're going to provide options for other browsers and search engines and app stores when a new Android phone is activated. So I was just wondering if this is the right way to think about these kinds of disputes in other areas of the world, where you may be under some regulatory pressure around Android bundles, or if that was kind of a one-off, isolated agreement. Thank you. Sundar Pichai : I think \u2013 without getting into specifics, I think when we deal with regulatory issues, I mean, the concerns vary differently depending on local laws and what the concerns are. I think in the case of Russia, I think there were some specific issues. And I'm glad we were able to work together with the regulatory agencies there, with our partners there, to come to a good solution. I'm not sure that's the right template. But as much as we are very committed to making sure we work with all the right agencies in all the countries we operate in, and I'm confident we'll get to a good place. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Sundar, ahead of this advertising conference I was thinking about Search innovation. And over the last four years, you've had an acceleration with PLAs, a really acceleration with the third ad link. And I'm just wondering, maybe you could talk about what excites you. Or do you think there's still a lot to go on Search monetization or coverage? And then from Ruth, obviously so many areas you can invest in. You could cut price on Cloud. You could really ramp up engineers in the core or Cloud. Just a lot you can do. And just how does the management team think about balancing profitability versus driving market share and long-term growth? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On Search, I continue to get surprised by the kind of things users reach out to us for and how that keeps evolving and changing. And with the Assistant now, too, just exposes a whole new surface area. And so I think there's a lot of innovation ahead. In terms of monetization, I think about it \u2013 it still looks like there is a lot of \u2013 for example, if you just look at retail, 90% of retail is still offline. So there are many, many secular trends like that, which we look at and we see a huge opportunity to help connect users to the information they are looking for. So, structurally, I do think we still have lots of both innovation and growth ahead for the long term, and that's how we think about it. Maybe to Ruth on the second part? Ruth Porat : Yeah, and really actually building on that, to answer the second part of your question. When we look at the ongoing momentum that you've seen here in Sites revenue, it really does go to innovation. No one change tends to drive results, it's really the combined benefit of all that we're doing across the franchise, continuing to invest in the business and the benefits that we see there. And that's the way we look at it, is we have tremendous opportunity continuing in mobile search and in YouTube across the business there. And as we're looking at these newer opportunities, all that we're doing in Cloud, in hardware, YouTube subscription businesses, we analyze each one of those individually, working very closely with the leaders and the milestones that are established there. We do very much across the business have an operating principle that too many resources and too few can lead to suboptimal decisions and execution. And so what we're looking at over a multiyear period is the pace of innovation that's appropriate, given the sizable opportunity. But the key point \u2013 and I've said it on so many different calls \u2013 is that we remain focused on long-term value creation. And we're excited about the growth opportunities, not just within Google but across Alphabet with all that we're doing in Other Bets. And so we're looking at these, again, individually, over a multiyear period, looking at milestones, and appropriately calibrating the pace of investment that is logical. And at the same time, we continue to have a focus on enhancing efficiencies where we can. But overall, as I keep saying, our main priority remains revenue and profit dollar growth. Operator : Thank you. Justin Post : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Michael B. Nathanson: Thanks. I have two for Sundar. The first is, now that you've launched YouTube TV, I wonder if you'd tell us about the advertising opportunity there. And then what are you going to do, given all the assets, to maximize an inventory for marketers? And then secondly, I wonder, with that focus on brand safety you hear now from agencies and the bigger marketers, what's going to be the long-term impact, do you think, to YouTube programmatic from a more focused view on finding the right places to advertise? Sundar Pichai : On your first question about YouTube TV, we're just getting started. I think the product is really intended for the YouTube generation. It's really great to see a take on how to consume TV, which is mobile first for that generation. And I think \u2013 I've been using the product and enjoying it. And I think that gives \u2013 as (50:50) we rethink that experience and make it work better and scale it up, I think it's \u2013 your question is valid. The delivery of ads on TV has also not evolved at the same speed as the delivery of ads and media content on the Internet. So I think \u2013 we think we have a significant opportunity to improve their experience, and especially for advertisers to be able to think across all these surfaces. So I think there's a lot of opportunity, but I think we are very focused on the consumer experience first. On your second question around longer-term impact, look, these types of issues are not new for us. Over the past many, many years, as we've built services, scaled it up on the ramp, (51:37) constantly things evolve. We adapt to it, be it from spam in email or how we do search ranking, and all the efforts we put into it. These are the classes of problems our engineers are really, really good at working. These are large-scale system problems, and especially with machine learning and AI, over time I think we can really put in the right systems in place. And our teams work very thoughtfully with the external ecosystem, with our advertisers, agencies, and partners. And I think that balance will help us get it right for the very long term. Michael B. Nathanson: Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura. Your line is now open. Anthony DiClemente : Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, Sites TAC as a percentage of revenue grew sequentially and year over year. I totally understand that mobile search is contributing meaningfully to the profit dollars, but as we look at the Sites TAC as a percentage, is there a quarter or is there a point in time looking forward where that sort of elevated TAC growth rate will anniversary or fall back into line with Sites revenue growth as a growth rate? Is there anything you can do to proactively manage that TAC growth? And then for Sundar, on YouTube, as the competition out there for video content really intensifies, to what extent is YouTube providing more favorable economics to its content creators in order to ensure that YouTube remains the leading platform and, importantly, in a lot of cases, an exclusive platform for your most popular channels? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So on Sites TAC, as we've often discussed, and as you said in your question, there are a number of factors that affect Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue, and the primary driver has been the strong growth in mobile and the fact that more mobile searches are subject to TAC. The other factors include the mix of paid versus organic, as well as changes in partner, mix, or agreement terms. And when we look year over year, the primary driver of the increase is \u2013 very much to your question \u2013 the strength in mobile search. And we do expect Sites TAC to increase as a percentage of revenues. But, again, our focus continues to be on growing profit dollars. And I think the main point is we're very pleased to have a very strong business in a rapidly growing area. And that's benefiting our profit dollars even as the TAC percentage increases. Sundar Pichai : And on YouTube, when I look at it from a content creator standpoint, I think there are a lot of factors which are working well. So, for example, when we recently invested in original shows, we find that like over half the time people spend watching originals is on their mobile phones. We find that creators who are featured in originals experience a significant boost in YouTube subscribers and watch time on their main channels as well, often from new fans. So all of this shows us that the enthusiasm which is there for the platform, how creators can do unique things which are different from what they can do on other platforms. And I think that's what gives us the differentiation here. And in these areas, we are just getting started, and so there's a lot more to come. And I think that will help us provide better economics for them, better engagement for them, and I think positions us well. Anthony DiClemente : Thank you both. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Your line is now open. Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc. Sundar, when we think about virtual reality and augmented reality, from your point of view, what are the key steps that are needed to see more mass market appeal and usage? And could you help quantify the amount of investment that you are willing to place in this area before you expect to see a payoff? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : So I think obviously you're seeing we are very happy with the progress we have seen with Daydream. Just like we built Android, we are good at building platforms and ecosystems, and I think we are taking the right first steps with VR there as well. When I broadly look at VR and AR, I think all of us clearly understand the potential, and technically we are making the breakthroughs that are needed. And all of it needs to converge, from a hardware, software, services standpoint, to a stage where it has mass-market appeal. And I think that is still some ways away. The thing which gives me excitement is all these changes start happening with a set of early adopters and moves mainstream, and so we're engaging at that level with the early adopters. And that's where Daydream is working well. We are learning how to write great content on top of VR. YouTube, Google Earth VR, Tilt Brush \u2013 these are all great examples. So underlying technology wise, be it all the kinds of sensors and tracking you need to do, the machine learning and AI you need, things like voice recognition, everything \u2013 it's just a computing evolution, so everything we are investing today in machine learning and AI, as well as what we're doing in our computing platforms, transitions well. So I think we're already well-positioned to play this, and so I think we'll thoughtfully approach it. And we'll approach it more holistically. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Colin Alan Sebastian : Thank you. I guess just as a follow-up to the question on voice interfaces and personal assistant, something that Larry also called out in his founder's letter. It appears there are more tests around monetization, including transactions and integration with Shopping Express. I wonder if there's a view internally now as to how best to make that transition in a voice-first world towards monetization, towards voice and less tech spend and video-centric? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : We are very focused, actually, on the consumer experience now, and it's a good question. And we've always had these questions, be it the early days of Search or when YouTube was first built out. How do I see (58:09) experiences created, like will YouTube ever make money? And so I think if you go and create these experiences in a way that works at scale for users, the monetization will follow. And obviously \u2013 and the models will be different than what we have today, but I think we are squarely focused right now on delivering a world-class experience through voice and through Assistant. Colin Alan Sebastian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question and answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for closing remarks. Ellen West : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2017 call. Thank you, and good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Later we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ellen West : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2016, filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumption as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Our revenues of $26 billion in the second quarter demonstrate the ongoing momentum in our businesses with broad-based strength globally. Revenues were up 21% year-on-year, and up 23% in constant currency. Advertising revenues benefitted from the strong performance insights, which was led in particular by tremendous results in mobile search with a strong contribution from YouTube. Healthy growth and network revenues was driven by our programmatic business. We also had substantial growth in other revenues from Cloud, Play and hardware. Our outline for today's call is first I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will review our results on a GAAP basis, which include the impact of stock-based compensation. The European commission fine of $2.7 billion is reflected in our GAAP results with the fine displayed as a separate line item for clarity. In order to assist with comparing this quarter's results to prior periods, we are also providing operating income, net income and EPS results that exclude the impact of the fine. The fine is not reflected in our segment results. Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss our business and product highlights for the quarter after which we will take questions. I will start with the summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenues were $26 billion up 21% year-over-year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $364 million or $361 million after the benefits of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenues grew 23% year-over-year. Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography. You can see that our performance was strong in all regions. U.S. revenues were up 23% year-over-year to $12.3 billion. EMEA revenues were $8.5 billion up 14% year-over-year reflecting weakness in the British pound and the euro. Revenues were up 21% in fixed FX terms. APAC revenues were $3.7 billion up 28% versus last year and up 27% in fixed FX terms. Other America's revenues which include results from Canada and Latin America were $1.4 billion up 31% versus last year in both reported and fixed FX terms. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results were $10.4 billion up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.3 billion up 27% year-over-year primarily driven by Google related expenses. Specifically, costs associated with operating our datacenters including depreciation, content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and hardware related costs. Operating expenses including the impact of the EC fine are $11.5 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fine operating expenses were $8.8 billion up 18% year-over-year. Year-on-year expense growth reflects the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle from the third quarter to the first quarter of each year. As discussed previously, this affects the quarterly pace of stock-based compensation in 2017, but not the overall size of the expense for the year. In order to transition to the new timing, we made a one-time half year grant in Q1 of this year, which is reflected in elevated year-on-year expense growth in Q2. As a result, stock-based compensation totaled $2 billion up 33% year-over-year. Headcount at the end of thank you quarter was 75,606 up 1,614 people from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas the most sizable headcount additions were once again made in Cloud for both technical and sales roles consistent with the priority we place on this business. Operating income was $4.1 billion, excluding the impact of the EC fine, operating income was $6.9 billion up 15% versus last year and the operating margin was 26%. Other income and expense was $245 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 19.5% for the second quarter, net income was $3.5 billion and earnings per diluted share were $5.1. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, net income was $6.3 billion and earnings per diluted share were $8.90. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash, CapEx for the quarter was $2.8 billion. Operating cash flow was $7.4 billion with free cash flow of $4.6 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $94.7 billion of which approximately $57.9 billion or 61% is held overseas. Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $25.8 billion up 21% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $18.4 billion in the quarter up 20% year-over-year. The biggest contributors to growth again this quarter were mobile search and YouTube. Network revenues were $4.2 billion up 13% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing strength of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $3.1 billion up 42% year-over-year, we have been talking about our bigger investment areas within Google and you can see the momentum here reflecting contributions from our newer revenue streams again this quarter on top of the ongoing strength in Play. Specifically Cloud continues to benefit from the ongoing investments in our go-to-market and product efforts. Hardware continues to grow at a healthy pace year-on-year with the extension of our product line geographically, particularly Google Home and Wi-Fi, the dollar impacted growth was more muted than in prior quarters reflecting seasonality. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Total traffic acquisition costs were $5.1 billion, or 22% of total advertising revenues, and up 28% year-over-year. The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenues, as well as Network TAC as a percentage of Network revenues, continues reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year-over-year as a result of an increase in the Sites TAC rate, driven by the shift to mobile, which was again partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites, which carries lower TAC. Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 40% year-over-year. Operating income, including the impact of SBC, was $7.8 billion, up 12% versus last year, and the operating margin was 30%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.8 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction. A couple of Google reminders for the third quarter. Headcount additions tend to be seasonally high in Q3, because that is when we bring on new graduates. In addition, please keep in mind that our marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back-half of the year due to the holiday season, particularly as we promote our made-by Google line of hardware products. Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. For the second quarter, Other Bets revenues were $248 million primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss, including the impact of SBC, was $772 million for the second quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $152 million, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q 2016. We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets, a couple of updates. Nest continues to drive ongoing product expansion, such as our recent introduction of the indoor security camera, Nest Cam IQ as well as geographic expansion both of which support its position as the leading brand in the connected home. In life sciences, in addition to our progress at Verily, Calico has focused its efforts on the basic mechanisms of ageing and three ageing related diseases representing the leading causes of death. Calico has established more than 20 active collaborations with other life sciences companies and academic institutions. With Loon we recently demonstrated the technology in Peru by successful delivering basic internet connectivity to tens and thousands of people affected by the tragic floods there. We worked in partnership with the Peruvian government and Telefonica. And our progress with Waymo continues nicely, as it is reflected in the writer program in Phoenix and our recently announced partnerships with Lift and Avis. Let me wrap up, almost two years after the creation of Alphabet, we see the benefits of our focus within Google and Other Bets and are pleased with the opportunities we have for sustained revenue and earnings growth. We are obviously very happy with the ongoing strength in ads revenue, particularly in Search. Our compelling secular trends continue to drive user adoption and engagement with mobile devices. Our engineering and machine learning acumen enables us to build better experiences for users and advertisers. We continue to see increasing contributions from our growing non-ads revenue businesses, Play continues to be a strong contributor, in addition we have been making big Bets within Google focused on Cloud, hardware and subscription businesses in YouTube in order to better serve customers, while also building additional and differentiated revenue streams. These businesses are consistent with and complementary to our core capabilities and leverage our infrastructure, distribution and engineering. We believe we have a compelling runway here. Longer-term we see great opportunity in the businesses we are building in Other Bets. These businesses reflect the incredible engineering talent across Alphabet most notably in machine learning. Our revenue growth and Alphabet structure give us both the opportunity and confidence to invest in our businesses for the long-term. We are doing that, while being very deliberate about the focus, scale and pace of investment and remain committed to being consciences in our use of all resources. We're increasing investment in areas where we see the most potential scaling back and others and sharpening our organizational effectiveness to make the most of the resources available. Thank you. And let me now turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thanks Ruth. We had a phenomenal quarter. Google continues to lead the shift to AI driven computing. We are working to make this incredible technology available to everyone around the world. It's our focus on infusing our products and platforms with power of machine learning and AI that's driving our success. Today, I'll spend time talking about the areas where we are confidently investing for the future. First the incredible momentum we are seeing in some of our core products followed by machine learning. Next an update on three of our most promising bets, YouTube, Cloud and our Hardware businesses. And I will conclude the strong performance of our computing and advertising platforms. To start our core products and the AI powering them. Google has always been about using deep computer science and insights to solve some of the world's most complex problems. People are no longer only using a keyboard, mouse and multi-touch, but are also using emerging inputs like voice and camera to ask questions and get things done in the real world. We are seeing this in the way people interact with the Google Assistant, which is already now available on more than 100 million devices since launching last year and there is more to come. Since we released an Assistant SDK that will enable a wide range of new hardware devices, which will include the Google Assistant. We now have more than 70 home automation partners on the Assistant on Google Home and Phones, including Honeywell, Logitech and LG. So you can do everyday things around the house using your voice. At Google IO, we announced Google Lens available later this year. Lens is a set of vision-based computing capabilities that can understand what you're looking at and help you take action based on that information. So for example, if you saw a poster for your favorite band, you would be able to take a picture and get relevant information and buy tickets to their next concert. In Search, a great feature we launched this quarter in the U.S. is job search. To make looking for a job easier for everyone, no matter what line of work you are in. Many of these products that make people's lives easier are being powered by machine learning. One focus area for us this quarter has been enabling our machine learning algorithms to learn and improve our products much faster. One such research initiative auto ML enables us to pursue approaches to automate the design of machine learning models. Our ability to rapidly deploy the best machine learning in all of our products enabled us this quarter to launch all sorts of new smart features, to help moderate comments, suggest smart replies in Gmail and improved translations. We rolled out new machine learning features in Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail and Google Photos, which now has more than 500 million monthly users who backup 1.2 billion photos and videos every day. I was also pleased that deep minds AlphaGo team was in Beijing for the Future of Go Summit where AlphaGo played against the number one world player Ke Jie. Since playing AlphaGo Ke Jie has been on a 20 game winning streak. He has said playing AlphaGo as fundamentally changed his understanding of the game. It\u2019s remarkable to see AI have such a profound effect on one of the world's oldest most strategic games. It can have the same impact in so many fields from medicine to science to energy usage and more. Now let's move to some of our biggest Bets. First YouTube. YouTube now has 1.5 billion monthly viewers and people watch on average 60 minutes a day on their phones and tablets. That's incredible and it helps 1000s of passionate video creators make money. The fastest growing stream for YouTube is in the living room. YouTube watch time on TV screens has nearly doubled year-on-year. This quarter we unveiled six new ad supported YouTube originals from celebrities including Ellen DeGeneres and Kevin Hart, and YouTube creators like Rhett & Link. Advertiser feedback on these new shows has been extremely positive. Last week our Live TV service YouTube TV had a ten new metro areas across America tripling the markets where it\u2019s available in just four months. And to our next big Bet with great momentum Google Cloud. Google Cloud Platform, GCP continues to experience impressive growth across products, sectors and geographies and increasingly with large enterprise customers in regulated sectors. To be more specific about our momentum with big customers, in Q2 the number of new deals we closed worth more than $0.5 million is three times what it was last year. Responding to the growth in existing and new customers around the world, we continue to invest in datacenters to provide them the fastest most reliable service. We opened new Google Cloud regions in Northern Virginia, Singapore, Sydney and London. We also continue to build out our partnerships, in Q2 we announced an expansion of our partnership at SAP and a new partnership with Nutanix to integrate their products with GCP. So customers can run workloads in hybrid environments, On-Prem and in the Cloud using containers and Kubernetes. Now let's talk about our Hardware business. Sales of our new family of hardware continue to be encouraging and we are making good progress bringing these devices to more people. Google Home is now available in four countries, the U.S., Canada, Australia and the UK and we have announced its coming to France and Germany in early August. The Pixel phone continues to be really popular and Google Wi-Fi just launched in Canada, Germany and France to glowing reviews. Every day, I hear of people who love this product and how it has made Wi-Fi work much better in their homes. Shifting gears, our computing and advertising platforms are driving great results for our partners. There are now more than $2 billion monthly active Android devices around the world. It's really humbling so many choose Android. We're seeing a number of hardware makers launching devices to positive reviews, including the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6. At Google IO this quarter, we gave developers early access to Android O, which will focus on vitals like battery life and performance. And Google Play continues to be a vital distribution platform for developers. An incredible 82 billion apps were downloaded from Google Play in the last year alone. That's 11 apps for every person on earth. We continue to work on the next generation of computing platforms, virtual and augmented realty. By the end of this year, there will be 11 Daydream ready devices on the market from manufacturers like Samsung, LG, Motorola and Asus. Turning to our advertising platforms. Here to machine learning is critical to helping advertisers and app developers analyze data in real time to reach consumers with more useful ads and measure campaign effectiveness. At Google Marketing Next this quarter we launched Google Attribution, a comprehensive measurement tool that allows marketers to measure the impact of their campaigns across devices and channels all in one place with no additional cost. We also launched new ad formats and bidding features in Universal App Campaigns to help developers grow their user base across Google Play, Search, YouTube, Gmail and the Display Network. At Google IO in 2016, we announced we had driven 2 billion app installs, today that number is more than 5 billion that's amazing growth. With 90% of transactions still happening offline, we want to help consumers find what they are looking for in brick and mortar stores. Our store visits technology is instrumental and understanding customer behavior that starts online and ends in store. Today, our store visits measurement is the largest program of its kind and we have now measured over 5 billion store visits in 17 countries. This quarter it also brought local ads and store visits measurement to video. Speaking of video, we are seeing continued success with bumper ads, our six seconds ad format. Both brands and viewers love the format as it's the ideal length to capture attention. L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, Xbox, Clinique and Neutrogena have all seen great success with bumpers. And Google Preferred continues to grow, we now have 100s of brands buying Google Preferred in the U.S. nearly triple the number since it launched three years ago. We are now just helping large brands, we are also helping millions of small businesses get to online and grow. Every month Google helps drive 100 billion visits to business websites and creates more than 3 billion direct connections between businesses and their customers. These interactions drive huge economic opportunities and growth for small businesses. Last month to increase these opportunities, we launched an easy way for millions of small businesses to create a free simple mobile optimized website. Small businesses can do it on a mobile phone in under 10 minutes, using the listing information already available on Google Search and Maps. And finally helping publishers grow their revenues remains a huge focus for us. We're using the power of automation and machine learning to improve our auction algorithms for publishers. The 50 improvements we have made since 2016 are generating 15% more revenue for publishers using double click ad exchange. Those are the highlights from the second quarter. This week will be another highlight for me, I'm going to Africa for a Google for Nigeria event to announce new products for Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa. I'm looking forward to seeing first time how technology and Google's products can make a real difference in people's lives. I want to express a very sincere thank you to every Googler who work tirelessly this quarter to bring all of our technology and products to the world. And to everyone listening thank you, and I hope you are enjoying starting the week off with us. And now back to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Sundar. We will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS Securities. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan Thanks for taking the question, maybe a big picture question directed to Sundar. As you think about the Google Assistant and what it can do medium-to-long term, maybe talk a little bit about how the Assistant as a product could now roll the gap between consumption and utility inside your products versus monetization over time with this specific focus I would love to hear about local in particular? Thank you so much. Sundar Pichai It's a good question, when I think about, we have, we are very focused over the long-term to making sure the Assistant can actually help people get things done in the real world. And so obviously when you think about it from that standpoint local becomes important. Over time, just like when the transition happened from desktop to mobile, people's bar for what they expect increased. They wanted more answers, they wanted more immediate gratification, right and that's a continuum and I think you'll see the trends. And so over time we are laser focused on making sure we can deliver against those experiences, and I think local and their particular strength over time both in terms of, the expertise we have built in local as well as our investment in Maps is hopefully paying off. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Doug Anmuth : Great, thanks for taking my question. First one for Ruth, I was just hoping you could help us understand at least qualitatively how core margins for the advertising business are trending within the Google segment? And then Sundar just on the Cloud business, I know you talked about four new regions being built out. Can you just talk about your strategy in building out that Cloud infrastructure, how we should think about it in terms of building out extra capacity or whether it's more in line with near-term demand? Thanks. Ruth Porat Thanks. So starting with your margin question like as we've often said, we're focused on revenue and operating income dollar growth and not on operating margins. We have strong positions in healthy growing areas and are adding really exciting additional growth areas and that's what we mean when we discussed driving long-term revenue and earnings growth. To get a little more specific, the gross margin, this quarter obviously reflects our product mix shift and although the cost of sales is higher as a percentage of revenues, these costs are associated with high growth product areas that enable us to create value for all of our stakeholders. And then on the OpEx side, the second quarter reflects a number of factors, first I think really to your question on an overtime point, you can see the impact of the timing shift in the equity refresh which we discussed previously. Now as a reminder that does abate in the back-half of the year, but you can see it here in the second quarter. And then what you are also seeing an OpEx growth is the investments in areas that we've spilled out. So for example in R&D you can see the impact of the headcount increases in our priority areas particularly Cloud and machine learning and marketing spend similarly reflects the strategic priority areas we've delineated particularly hardware and YouTube subscription. But as I said in my opening comments, we're increasing investment in areas where we see the most potential, we are scaling it back in others, we're focused on organizational effectiveness to make the most of all of our resources and all of that really underpins the goal to sustain both revenue and earnings growth over the longer term. Doug Anmuth : Thanks that's helpful. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini Thank you very much. I was just wondering Sundar, you mentioned some of the strength your seeing in GCP. Now I was just wondering if you could share with us, when you do win is there any commonality around the type of workloads that people are choosing you for? And can you share with us any updates on the go-to-market and kind of how you see all about where you've come over the last year, but even more importantly what you need to do to get it where you needed to be over the next 12 months? Thank you. Sundar Pichai All right, thanks, I would also take Doug's question on the infrastructure too and do it together, since they are related to Cloud. Overall, when we think about our infrastructure obviously we are serving Cloud as well as our internal products which are seeing tremendous growth as well. In terms of serving Cloud customers, we are world-class and available being reliable and those are things we want to stay best-in-class. So, we are clearly planning for that and planning ahead of our infrastructure and we have been consistently doing that. And Heather in terms of your question about workloads and stuff, we are actually seeing quite a diverse set of used cases across sectors and industries and geographies and so, I would say the breadth of what we have seen it's really surprised me. In terms of go-to-market, I shared an update on last, on that last quarter not sure there is much more interesting to add, we are continuing to do it well, we are scaling up and all the teams and the structure Diana has put in place is beginning to work well. And we are continuing to hire and scale all of this up, as quickly as we can. Heather Bellini Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney Yes, I have two questions please. First, one on TAC, Ruth the factors that cause, have been causing characterizing relatively structural the outsize growth of mobile and the rise of programmatic. So there is no particular reason to think that, we should see anything other than gradual increase in TAC as a percentage of both O&O and network revenue going forward. So are there any reasons why that wouldn't be the case, next year or two? And then Sundar, another one more interesting innovations, that was, that kind of came out of Google IO was Visual Search, and can you just talk about, maybe a little bit roadmap for that or to the extent that which, how long it will take us actually see that broadly in the market, and what you think the appetite or how do you think that will change the way people search for products in the future they build need to also search visually through your phone? Thank you. Ruth Porat So on the first question, there are obviously a number of factors that affect Sites TAC we've talked about them over time. The primary driver again this quarter, as you noted in question was the strong growth in mobile and the fact that more mobile searches are subject to TAC. But the increase in Sites TAC year-over-year, I think what I would stress is it really provides another lens on just how strong our mobile business is. There are other factors that affect the TAC rate including the mix of paid versus organic traffic as well as changes in partner mix and agreement terms. But I think at the, main point of your question here is we do continue to expect Sites TAC to increase, but our focus remains on growing profit dollars and I go back to my comment which is really pleased with the strength of our mobile business, which is benefiting profit dollars even as the TAC percentage increases. And programmatic, kind of a very similar answer which is we're pleased to have a strong position in the growing area. Sundar Pichai And questions around Visual Search, when we think about Google Lens, we think about it as a set of capabilities which will roll out across many different products. But we will mainly start getting it in the hands of our users in Q4. I think early days we want to make sure works well for used cases where it can and bet on the long-term trends in computer vision as we make progress there. I also think, there are cases where pulling out your phone and looking at it is a bit cumbersome and so over time as form factors emerge, there its more natural for you to look at and input that into computing you will get used more. Overall, for humans the way they see, visual input is a very high bandwidth way of communicating and so, it's important that we bring that in computing. So, long-run I'm very bullish on it, but we're going to roll this out slowly and thoughtfully. Mark Mahaney Thank you, Sundar. Thank you, Ruth. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Peter Stabler Thanks so much for the question. One for Sundar, at Marketing Next your team unveiled new ways that Google is leveraging consumer intense signals across your billion user plus platforms. It seems that some of the walls between product data silos are being lowered a bit, one of the obvious gains that [Street Harp] [ph] highlighted was search personalization. Wondering if you could speak broadly to the opportunity and looking at data from a targeting perspective more holistically across platforms? Thanks so much. Sundar Pichai I think it's important we have always felt as marketers when they spend and try to reach users, the more we can give them visibility about how their spend is working and they can attribute across all the stages of the funnel. I think that will really help make everything work well. So, we have always taken the long-term view. And everything we do be it store versus which we did a while ago or more recently at Google Marketing Next we talked about Google Attribution as well. So, all that starts adding up and I think pushes in this right long-term deduction. And there is more work to be done. But, I think as users use our -- use everything across multiple products and devices in a thoughtful way, I think making all of this work well, we see it as an opportunity ahead of us. Peter Stabler Thanks Sundar. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak Thanks for taking my questions today. I have two. The first one you talked about micro moments throughout the course of the year and micro moments on mobile. I was wondering, could you give us a couple of examples of micro moments or searching verticals where you have really seen an increase in your monetization over the last year. And Sundar, as you look out across all the search verticals, what are the two biggest one or two used cases you still see to improve the overall relevancy of search results and potential monetization? Sundar Pichai On the first one, I would probably be rather than be very specific, any time people are looking to buy, find, go do things, you could be looking for a local pizza or you could be buying -- we see craze like jeans near me and people are looking for jeans next to them. So these are all very, very specific things and in all of these cases, we have found we have been able to impact the experience for both users and advertisers. So, I think that applies generally broadly, in terms of all the verticals, I think there are a lot of opportunities local has been an area of strength for us. We have seen a lot of traction and continue to think as a vertical given the assets we have built over the years we can continue to invest more and do better for our users. Brian Nowak Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is now open. Ross Sandler Great. I have two questions for Sundar. First is, as you mentioned 15% yield improvement on publisher yield for [indiscernible] from machine learning, is there a comparable step inside of Google owned and operated search or YouTube after implementing machine learning you saw yield improvement of x, be curious hear to that. And then, the second question is, if you look out into the future, you guys mentioned 2 billion Android actives I/O and you mentioned 11 apps per user in your prepared remarks. Is Google forced to unbundle their own apps from Android in the future. What's the strategy to ensure that maps and YouTube and search get distribution and Android doesn't kind of go the way of China and other markets, be curious to hear that? Thank you. Sundar Pichai Let me take the first one first. On machine learning, we definitely machine learning we have been using it on search, Rank Brain has become one of the important signals in addition to the many other signals and search. And so, definitely that's had an impact same on YouTube across the board. I don't have any specific metrics to give but we definitely are seeing impact and we think we are in early days of the impact we can see. In terms of Android, we are obviously thoughtfully building Android out and scaling it out and we offer our apps as part of it. OEMs get to distribute other apps as well. We think it's a very open market, open ecosystem works well for everyone involved and I expect that to continue. And a lot of our products which are successful on Android happen to be successful outside of Android as well including on the web. These are products generally used by billions of users and by now we have worked hard to earn that trust and scale and so I'm confident we can continue scaling this up. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Dan Salmon Hey, good afternoon everyone. Sundar, I think the last update we heard publicly on promoted places on maps was in December when you announced that you would be beginning some limited tests. I don't think there has been any public comment from the company since then quite frankly haven't heard a whole lot anecdotally about it either. So, I was just hoping for a quick update on that product? Thank you. Sundar Pichai Overall, I mean it's in the area where we are still like really focused on improving the consumer experience I think. We are evolving maps to be a lot more beyond just driving directions and users are responding to it. And I think we are in the process of making all that work better. And also, we've also focused in terms of what we see as local opportunity within search as well. But, we will continue testing and evolving, I think we want to make sure we get the consumer experience right before we invest before on promoter opportunities on maps. Dan Salmon Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Justin Post Great. A few for Ruth. First, I'm wondering if you could comment at all on the cloud business profitability, medium or long-term, how you are thinking about that. Second, I would go ahead and take a short at the EC decision lately, clearly it is material for financials. How are you thinking about approaching that decision, and does that impact any of your other advertising businesses as far as innovation? And then finally, any thoughts on verticals that were strong this quarter that supported the organic revenue growth? Thank you. Ruth Porat So, on -- as you know, we don't break out by product, just adding a bit more color on cloud. We are clearly excited about the opportunity we have here and it does continue to drive sizable revenue growth as I said in my opening comments as did Sundar and we are seeing momentum in the business. I think the comment that Sundar made about the number of new deals over 500,000 increasing 3x year-on-year gives you an indication of the momentum in the business. It's obviously not a financial forecast but it does display the traction we are having with cloud in the market and GCP remains one of the fastest growing businesses across Alphabet, G-suite continues to have strong growth. So, we are really pleased with what that means for both the longer term trends in the profitability. We do believe that from -- the many years of investment we have already made and things like technical infrastructure and security which operate with tremendous efficiency that provides us with a benefit, but near term we are investing meaningfully in sales and engineering service support -- continuing to expand out regions to make sure that we are delivering the best experience for our enterprise customers and that's what we are really focused on. In terms of I think your second question was the EC there was really not much of an update there, we are still early in our analysis of the decision in the right next steps and we do have time to notify the commission of proposed remedies as well as implement changes. The main thing is, we are very focused on helping users and advertisers and our reviewing our options it's an ongoing matter. So, there is not much more to comment on that one. And then, the third question -- Justin Post On verticals that were strong? Ruth Porat Yes. In terms of -- I think that what you are trying to get out here on what are seeing in particular with sites revenue and there is not anyone thing to call out whether it's by vertical or steps that we are taking. And that's really what I would point you to more. I think it's an important point that we are very excited about the opportunities here given both the underlying secular trends broadly with mobile. Sundar talked a lot about that. But, also all that we are able to layer on top of it just given the engineering acumen here and we talked about this on prior calls, it's true again here this quarter that one change has been driving the results and so what you are seeing is the combined benefit of a number of changes we have made. It's really this maniacal focus on all elements of the user and advertiser experience and nothing to call out by vertical. Justin Post Thank you, Ruth. Ruth Porat Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark May of Citi. Your line is now open. Mark May Thanks for taking my questions. I think this first one is for Sundar. Data of course is a key differentiator and there is a lot of advertising, so maybe you could talk about how you've changed your use of Google search data and recently in areas outside of search and how that is or might impact the effectiveness of advertising on channels like YouTube and others outside of search? And then, Ruth, in your prepared remarks you mentioned tremendous growth in mobile search in the quarter, I think that's a more emphatic statement in recent quarters, hoping that maybe you could provide more color on some of the areas where you are seeing the change and quite trajectory coming from within mobile search? Thanks. Sundar Pichai On your first question, obviously, we do these things with the foremost thing being making sure, we do the right things for user privacy. But, within our own products we are trying to help users get a better experience across on the consumer side and the advertising side and I think there is opportunity there. And so, we will be thoughtful as we move forward. Ruth Porat And then on mobile search, I think what you are hearing is, we are really pleased with the ongoing efforts there and as I just said there was not one change that really drove this, what extraordinary about the team is, with the focus on users and advertisers, what is it that is most useful Sundar has spoke about some of them with local, but it's really again -- it's a lot of small incremental efforts that in the aggregate continue to enable us to benefit from what\u2019s a really nice underlying secular trend here. And that's what we are seeing in the results again. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from -- Mark May Nothing around, are you listening to this? It's something around like geography or platforms or\u2026 Ruth Porat Not sure, if that was directed to me or but in terms of geography I think hopefully one of the benefits the way we recast the data here last quarter was, so you can actually get a bit more insight into what's going on around the globe. And that's why I made the comment that we are having a really broad strength globally. You can see it in each one of the regions here. U.S. continues to deliver strong growth engagement across products, if you look at EMEA on a fixed FX basis up 21%, you can see the same in APAC, the same in other Americas. So, yes, there is broad based strength across geographies and I think -- I'm not calling out one particular area because the -- what you are seeing here is the secular trend I have used that term a couple of times now. And we are continuing to benefit from that around the globe. And we are continuing to benefit from on top of that the efforts of our team. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Steven Ju Okay. Thank you. Sundar, I was just wondering if you could give us some sense of advertiser option particularly among your retail appliance the store visit product, as it seems like there has been a large opportunity to drive offline purchasing. And Ruth, can you give us some sense of any headwinds you might be seeing in your streams of your revenue away from Play or GCP in the LNO revenue line as we have just knocked that across and just seeing a sequentially flat revenue line there. Thanks. Sundar Pichai I think I spoke about it in my opening remarks. But, since [indiscernible] measurement was announced three years ago advertisers have mentioned over 5 billion store visits globally. And I think we are just doing -- we have just badly scratched the surface. But, our marketing next in May we announced that the store visit measurement will also rollout for YouTube TrueView campaigns and we will be rolling out store sales measurement in the coming months. So, advertisers can actually measure in-store revenue, store visits delivered by search and shopping apps. So, we have had good proof points advertisers who have used it, for example, Virgin Holidays used it, factored in store sales measurements and they realized their search campaigns generate double the profit comparatively looking at online KPIs alone. So, I think there is a lot of opportunity there. And so, we will do more by over time. Ruth Porat And then, you asked on the other revenue line it was up nicely again this quarter 42% year-on-year and that obviously includes the impact of FX. It's obviously a mix of businesses including some of our bigger investment areas, most notably cloud and hardware and as I said at the outset Play continues to perform really well. I think if you are asking about the quarter-on-quarter sequentially you noted, we are talking about a mix of businesses that have different characteristics and just state the obvious Play is more hit driven. It's highly seasonal, hardware is also seasonal. So, the year-on-year provides a better sense to the dynamics of the business and that's where you can see in this line up year-on-year really nicely this quarter. Steven Ju Okay. Thank you. Ruth Porat Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Colin Sebastian Thank you. Maybe just one question for Sundar. I wonder if you could update us on your thoughts regarding the conversions of Chrome and Android operating systems. And in particular I'm curious whether the emergence of Google Assistant and Voice as a corollary across devices is a reason to move forward more integration between the two platforms. Thanks. Sundar Pichai Look I'm -- I mean we have been thoughtfully doing it in putting users first and I'm excited at how Android apps are coming to Chromebooks and we see that as a great opportunity and I think that will help us deliver a very compelling experience. And we just have started doing at this year and I expected to really get momentum as we go through to the next year. So, that's an example of conversions and I think that will work really well and so. And in terms of products like Google Assistant and Voice, I think we will make sure for users it doesn't matter and they work across every platform they use including our platforms as well as other people's platform. So, we think about making sure our services free as many users as possible and so we are working on that as well. Colin Sebastian Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of John Blackledge of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. John Blackledge Great. Two questions, so for Sundar or Ruth, within cloud could you talk about your view of G Suites enterprise penetration right now, kind of key drivers of the adoption longer term. And if you view it as a potential differentiator for Google Cloud versus other large competitors. And then, within YouTube 60 minutes per day of viewing on phones and tablets obviously incredible at that scale. Any thoughts on kind of what could drive further material viewing or engagement growth over time? Thank you. Sundar Pichai And maybe on YouTube I would say, YouTube is one of those products which is scaling really well globally just like search did and we are seeing real strong growth on mobile. And we are seeing real strong growth for YouTube on emerging markets as well. And we are seeing real strong growth on television. So, if I look at YouTube on mobile on emerging markets on larger screens, they all look like newer opportunities and so I think there is a lot more growth ahead. And on cloud, I think we have kind of answered it. Obviously, we see differentiated strengths and machine learning, data analytics, security and reliability. And the combination of not just GCP, G Suite working together with GCP, we are seeing increasing win rates and option across enterprise customers. And I also think all the investments we are doing in terms of broadening our ecosystem including the newer partnerships with the companies I mentioned earlier that should begin to payoff. And overall, the return on investment from the hiring and region expansion we are doing. So, I think we are set-up incredibly well and look forward to the momentum ahead. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any closing remarks. Ellen West : Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2017 call. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ellen West : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Alphabet's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now, I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2016 filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update them. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now, I'll hand the call over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thanks, Ellen. We had a terrific quarter. Revenues of 27.8 billion were up 24% year-on-year, and also up 24% in constant currency. Advertising revenues benefited from strong performance in sites, which was powered by tremendous results in mobile search. Healthy growth in network revenues was again led by our programmatic business. We also benefited from substantial growth in other revenues from cloud, play and hardware. Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll view the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. Next, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions. Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenues were $27.8 billion, up 24% year-over-year. We realized a positive currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $255 million or $64 million after the impact of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenues grew 24% year-over-year. Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography; performance was strong in all regions. U.S. revenues were $12.9 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $9.1 billion, up 23% year-over-year in both reported and fixed FX terms. APAC revenues were $4.2 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 31% in fixed FX terms. Other Americas revenues were $1.5 billion, up 33% year-over-year and up 32% in fixed FX terms. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, were $11.1 billion, up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.6 billion, up 25% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. Specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and hardware-related costs. Operating expenses were $8.8 billion, up 11% year-over-year. The year-on-year expense growth in part reflects the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle from the third quarter to the first quarter of each year. As discussed previously, this change in SBC grant timing affects the quarterly pace of stock-based compensation in 2017, with elevated year-on-year expense growth in the first half of the year, but benefits the year-on-year comparisons for Q3 and Q4. Stock-based compensation totaled $1.8 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 78,101, up 2,495 people from last quarter. As in prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count additions were once again made in cloud for both technical and sales roles, consistent with the priority we place on this business. Operating income was $7.8 billion, up 35% versus last year, and the operating margin was 28%. Other income and expense was $197 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 15.6% for the third quarter. Net income was $6.7 billion and earnings per diluted share were $9.57. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $3.5 billion. Operating cash flow was $9.9 billion with free cash flow of $6.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $100.1 billion, of which approximately $60.5 billion or 60% is held overseas. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $27.5 billion, up 23% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $19.7 billion in the quarter, up 23% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by desktop search and strong performance from YouTube. Network revenues were $4.3 billion, up 16% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $3.4 billion, up 40% year-over-year, fueled by cloud, play and hardware. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Total traffic acquisition costs were $5.5 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 32% year-over-year. The increase in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up year-over-year, reflecting an increase in the sites TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 2% year-over-year. Operating income including the impact of SBC was $8.7 billion, up 29% versus last year and the operating margin was 32%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $3.6 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction. Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. For the third quarter, Other Bets revenues were $302 million, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber, and Verily. Operating loss including the impact of SBC was $812 million for the third quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $77 million, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber, due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q 2016. We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates; Nest continues to drive ongoing product expansion with a number of notable launches including the Nest Thermostat E, which is offered at a lower price point than the Nest Learning Thermostat. Nest also announced a home security solution that includes the Nest Secure alarm system, Nest Hello video doorbell, the Nest Cam IQ outdoor security camera and corresponding software and services. Waymo continues to expand its geographic presence and announced this morning that it will commence winter testing in Michigan to build on our progress to-date addressing the challenge of autonomous driving in cold weather, particularly with snow, sleet and ice. Michigan is the sixth state where Waymo is testing its self-driving vehicles. Over the last eight years, Waymo's cars have self-driven in more than 20 cities. With Loon, we were pleased to announce just last week that the team is collaborating with AT&T to deliver emergency Internet service to the hardest hit parts of Puerto Rico. Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. First, in terms of revenues, results this quarter again reflect our relentless focus on innovation, which is growing our advertising revenues. I frequently highlight our culture of innovation. In that regard, the most important point is that we are data driven with an extraordinary team of engineers, product managers and designers, who constantly challenge assumptions and run thousands of experiments annually to enhance user and advertiser experiences. This approach enables us to find new opportunities given that the way consumers seek information continues to evolve. Our teams work relentlessly to anticipate and adapt to the expanding capabilities of both software and hardware. Further, our culture of innovation is building our non-advertising revenue streams in cloud, play and hardware. Earlier this month, for example, we launched our expanded line of hardware products, bringing the best AI software and hardware together and building on the first generation of Made by Google products we introduced last year. Longer-term, we remain excited about the opportunities in our Other Bets with ongoing progress. Second, with respect to profitability, we continue to remain focused on long-term dollar growth versus margins. Pressure in our total cost of revenues reflects our product mix shift with a number of our higher growth businesses also carrying higher cost of revenues. In our advertising businesses, TAC continues to increase as our highest growth areas, mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. We expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenue. As we've frequently stated, we remain focused on profit dollar growth, and these areas are additive to our growth. The other cost of revenues associated with our non-advertising businesses is also affected by product mix. In the fourth quarter in particular, the impact of our growing hardware line will be more accentuated given the early stage of this business and holiday seasonality. On operating expenses, we remain committed to investing to support our growing product areas. The more modest OpEx growth in Q3 reflects both the timing of stock-based compensation and the timing of sales and marketing spend, with the reality that not all investments fall neatly into a single calendar quarter. In particular, we're committed to sales and marketing investments in Q4 for the important holiday season. The most significant uptick in marketing will be to support our new expanded hardware line, which was just announced at the beginning of the fourth quarter. In addition, we are investing to support YouTube and our other platforms. Third, as to CapEx, we continue to invest to support business momentum, including increased compute power from machine learning, which is an asset across Alphabet as well as to support cloud, search and YouTube growth. In conclusion, a great quarter. Thank you. And let me now turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Ruth. We had another great quarter. I've been really proud of the progress this quarter, launching popular new products and continuing to grow our business in new areas. It's been particularly exciting to see our early bet on artificial intelligence pay off and go from a research project to something that can solve new problems for a billion people a day. Even though we are in the early days of AI, we are already rethinking how to build products around machine learning. It's a new paradigm compared to mobile-first software, and I'm thrilled how Google is leading the way. Consumers can already experience how AI allows them to interact with computing more naturally than ever before. Computers are adapting to people rather than people needing to adapt to computers. Fundamental to this experience is Google Search and our Assistant. We introduced Assistant last year and it continues to get better every day, helping people get things done in the real world. Walmart and Target have recently integrated with Google Home, which means you can order everyday items from them much more easily. 500 million people now use the machine learning smarts of Google Photos to manage and share their memories. That billion plus people using Google Maps now get thoughtfully contextual information like how to find parking where they are going. And businesses are seeing how AI can help them grow. Our open-source software, TensorFlow, is allowing anyone to use machine learning to solve problems even in industries like agriculture. Researches recently use TensorFlow to make smartphones able to identify disease in cassava plants, a major food source in the developing world. We made TensorFlow open-source and free because we fundamentally believe in creating computing platforms that developers can customize and build on. I'm really pleased with the way our computing platforms, like Android and Chrome, have continued to grow, enabling great experiences for people all over the world and powering devices for more than 1,000 brands worldwide. This quarter, we released the latest operating system, Android 8.0, and released a preview of ARCore, which brings augmented reality to existing Android phones. Last week, we announced a partnership with Samsung to bring ARCore to all Galaxy devices. Even though it's been an incredible busy few years and technology is moving rapidly, at our core, we remain an information company. Our mission to provide useful information to people in every corner of the world is unchanged. We care deeply about the quality of information we provide and constantly work to get this right. As technology evolves, we have to evolve with it to ensure quality information can flourish. Our teams are making a big effort to support journalists and other people who produce high-quality information around the world. We are supporting publishers as they decide the right approach to free articles and subscription content. We are moving away from first click free to a more flexible model of content sampling. And we are working with publishers to build a frictionless payment solutions for subscriptions that can help them grow revenues and find new readers. As new threats arise, we are committed to protecting journalists and media organizations from hacking and denial-of-service attacks. For example, we just launched the advanced production program for Google accounts, which is designed to protect the accounts of those most at risk of targeted attacks, including journalists and other public figures. To wrap up my overview, I'm thrilled with how Google is solving big problems and making products that billions of people use every day. Now let's review our three big bets, starting with YouTube. YouTube continues to see phenomenal growth as the premier global destination where people go to watch video. Three of the key areas we are focused on are; strengthening the existing community, continuing to drive growth and expanding our subscriptions business. On the community side, we are helping create meaningfully interactions that bring creators and fans closer together. This quarter, we launched a new feature that lets viewers share videos directly in the app. So the minute you see a video from a creator you love, you can share the fun with friends and family. We're also seeing significant growth in other areas. As I mentioned in the last earnings call, YouTube now has over 1.5 billion users. On average, these users spend 60 minutes a day on mobile. But this growth isn't just happening on desktop and mobile. YouTube now gets over 100 million hours of watch time in the living room every day, and that's up 70% in the past year alone. We are continuing to invest in new subscription based monetization models. YouTube Red, our first foray into the subscription market, is on track to release over 40 original shows this year and YouTube TV, our live TV subscription service, continues to expand into new markets. It now covers two-thirds of U.S. households and is available in 15 metro areas. Now on to Google Cloud; we continue to make progress winning over enterprise customers. Customers tell us they are switching to Google Cloud Platform because of our prowess in data analytics and machine learning, our commitment to being an open platform with tools like Kubernetes, which runs in both cloud and hybrid environments and our leadership in security. Just yesterday we announced a new partnership at Cisco. We are collaborating on an open solution that gives customers an easy approach to the cloud, enabling them to run apps that span both on-prem environments and Google Cloud Platform. G Suites, our collaboration and productivity applications are leading the industry. We have made improvements to drive, docs and Gmail launching new features to help teams work better together. Nielsen recently moved to G Suite and said it's a great productivity and collaboration tool for their modern workforce. All of these things are driving momentum with customers and partners. Companies like Kohls, PayPal, Rolls-Royce Marine in Europe and popular messaging app, Hike in India, moved to Google Cloud. We also announced a new partnership with Marketo and expanded our relationship with Pivotal and VMware. To support our growing global customer base, we introduced two new regions in the quarter in S\u00e3o Paulo and Frankfurt and continue to grow our go-to-market team. Next, our hardware business. Earlier this month, we launched our second-generation family of Made by Google hardware products built with AI at the core. Last year, we focused on building the foundation to launch a line of devices Made by Google. This year, we are focused on bringing together the best AI software and hardware to give people a great user experience. For example, the new Google Home Max is a smart speaker powered by the Assistant. It has AI-based smart sound, which adapts the audio experience to the user's environment context and preferences. The new Pixel 2 has the world's best smartphone camera and a useful feature where you can summon the Google Assistant by just squeezing the phone. To get these devices in people's hands, we are also focused on scaling our go-to-market strategy. We are investing more in marketing. We're launching in more countries and we are offering these devices in more retailers, and we are already seeing results. Pre-orders of Pixel on day one this year were more than double what they were last. Also this quarter, we signed a deal with HTC in Taiwan that will help accelerate our hardware business by bringing on a team of talented engineers. This deal lays the foundation for our continued efforts next year. And our advertising platforms continue to drive great results for our partners. While mobile has given rise to an unprecedented amount of data and complexity for advertisers, we think that machine learning will help it make \u2013 will help make it easier for advertisers to reach consumers. But even as we give advertisers incredible scale and reach across our ad platforms, we know consumer attention is scarce. That's why we are pleased YouTube ads continue to deliver the highest viewability rates in the industry. YouTube now has a 95% ad viewability rate, which is significantly higher than the average 66% viewability rate of other video ads. We continue to see the industry shift to six second bumper ads and so greater adoption this quarter from brands like Bear, Ben & Jerry's, Louis Vuitton and Volvo. And Google continues to be the platform of choice to help small business owners get online and grow their business. On our last earnings call, I mentioned a free website builder for small businesses. During the quarter, more than 1 million small businesses used it to build up websites, helping many of them get online for the first time. We also introduced local post, which allows small business owners to easily post their latest updates like upcoming events, special offers and new arrivals, right on Google Search in Maps. Our commitment to both large and small advertisers shows how we build products that all businesses can succeed in. That mission also has a geographical dimension, and I wanted to say a word about the momentum we are seeing in Asia. Our revenues are up significantly in the region, driven by great results we are driving for existing and new advertisers. That holds true across developed markets like Japan and emerging markets like the Philippines and Vietnam, all of which have seen the number of active advertisers grow by 25% or more in the past 12 months. And this growth is bringing tremendous benefits to our partners there. In the past three years, we have paid out more than $24 billion to our publisher, creator and app developer partners in Asia Pacific. And to help millions of people, we are building products specifically designed for local markets in Asia. In India last month, we launched Tez, a mobile payments and commerce app that already has more than 7.5 million users who have made more than 30 million transactions. I'm really excited about the potential this brings for India's mostly cash-based economy. As I said at the start, it's been a great quarter for Google. Just two weeks ago, I was in Pittsburgh launching our new Grow with Google initiative, which provides digital skills to millions of people and economic opportunity to countless businesses. It was amazing to see firsthand the transformative impact that information is having in schools, in the workplace and for local business. As I said then, I remain a technology optimist, not only because I believe in technology, but because I believe in people. I want to thank all the Googlers who continue to work so hard to advance our mission and to help people everywhere. Thank you. Ellen West : Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions. Operator : And our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open. Eric J. Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can. One, we've seen a lot of partnership announcements intra-quarter on the e-commerce side with Google Express and voice assisted shopping on Google Home. Wanted to understand better your ambitions in e-commerce as a marketplace or a platform and how that might also feed back into the advertising business? Second question would be about the cash on the balance sheet and sort of how philosophically you think about deploying that cash against either shareholder returns or some of the big opportunities you laid out today? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Maybe I'll take the first question and give it to Ruth on the cash question. We are very excited about the partnerships we are getting here with large retailers, and we are seeing traction globally. We've obviously partnered with them through our advertising products. But with shopping, especially as we move on to making shopping more seamless across mobile and newer computing categories like Google Home, I think there's tremendous interest here. So we are just getting started. And I think you will see us make a lot more progress and have a lot more announcements. And I think we are going to be relentlessly focused on making the buying experience much more seamless for users. So there's a lot more to come. Ruth Porat : So in terms of your second question. There was really no change from the approach we've talked about previously as we think about capital allocation. The priority is organic, as you said in your question. We have a host of really exciting opportunities and ensuring that we're investing to support long-term growth remains number one. The second is strategic, continuing to add on where it makes sense. We're pleased to have added on HTC this quarter. Acquisitions have obviously been an important part of our history. And then the third is the return of capital and no change or update there in terms of how we think about that. Eric J. Sheridan: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Great, thanks. Two questions, please. Sundar, you talked about APAC. You called out Asia. And we noticed that too, that that year-over-year growth rate was higher than \u2013 it was the highest, at least since you've been disclosing that. And you provided some of whats, but any whys behind why that growth is accelerating? Is that something that has just naturally reached the tipping point? Is there something different that Alphabet/Google has done in Asia to accelerate that growth? And then, Ruth, can I ask you. You talked about the factors driving TAC and you mentioned changes in partner agreements. Is there any way you could give us any more color? Did you just renew some major partner agreements and there's nothing of that magnitude into next year? Or should we just assume that this is just part of operations, there was nothing major recent, you could have major ones coming up? Just something to help us qualify \u2013 I don't you think you'd used that language before \u2013 what that indicated? Thanks a lot. Sundar Pichai : The Asia question, largely, I think we've been laying a foundation for a very, very long time. Our products are very heavily used there. And so we've worked hard to build a user base and then the mobile transformation is a secular shift there. That's definitely driving accelerated growth. And it creates a virtuous cycle. We see new advertisers coming on. We are investing more in Asia as well in addition to our go-to-market teams. We are building out great product and engineering teams. That's what has led us to improve core products like Search, Maps, YouTube, et cetera, to work better in those regions. And also launched region-specific products like Google Tez in India. So I think, overall, that's creating a good virtuous cycle and I'm looking forward to having more momentum there. Ruth Porat : And on your TAC question, as I indicated in the opening comments. There are a couple of drivers here. One is changes in partner agreements. And I think the main point is we're very pleased with our strong partnerships across the mobile ecosystem. And the other was the ongoing shift to mobile, which we've talked about a lot and the fact that it carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. I think the most important point is that what you're seeing is we have a very healthy mobile business, search business and it is growing substantially and our focus remains on long-term revenue and profit dollar growth. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Douglas T. Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. I had two. First, Ruth, you talked about the ongoing advertising innovation, and it's pretty clear that that's happening in mobile, which seems like it probably accelerated in the quarter. So I was hoping if you could comment on that. But then also, how do you think about where you are in terms of optimization on mobile relative to desktop? And then just second on YouTube. I was hoping you could comment on the extent to which you're seeing marketers return to the platform post the brand safety issues of 2Q and for a few of those who may not be back on yet, what are they looking for to fully return? Thanks. Ruth Porat : So it felt like a number of calls talked about the fact that there was no one item that was driving the momentum we saw in our sites revenue, and that was the point of giving you a bit more color here. We are really pleased with the momentum in the business, excited about the opportunities we have given the ongoing strong underlying secular trend, but wanted to give you more color on what do we mean by a culture of innovation, and that's really why I tried to get into a bit more about the rigor of the process. And one of the key points is that we do have the opportunity, and we anchor this indeed, that we're constantly challenging assumptions. We're running a lot of experiments to enhance user and advertiser experience. And the approach continues to be productive, especially because the line of inquiry evolves as user behavior evolves. And so what users wanted in the earlier days of smartphones when screens were smaller is obviously, very different from expectations users have today. Each quarter, the ads team introduces more than 100 enhancements out of a much larger pool of assumptions that they've tested. Machine learning is at the center of our processes and systems. And we do remain excited about the potential. Desktop, I commented on. We are pleased with the ongoing strength of the business. It delivered solid revenue growth that remains an important form factor for certain more complex tasks. We've talked about that in prior quarters. Things like planning vacations or assessing insurance options. And so I think with the strength here underscores the importance of desktop for many users in many task, notwithstanding, the growing utility of mobile for users. And then in terms of YouTube, I think you asked it. Well, we've been doing a lot to protect the ecosystems and do the right things for advertisers and users and content creators and the overwhelming majority of advertisers never left and those who did, many are already back on the platform. Douglas T. Anmuth: Thank you, Ruth. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Thank you so much. Sundar, I was wondering if you could share with us your thoughts on voice search. And I guess, in particular, how do you think about maintaining Google fleet as the way we search changes, and as we see increasing adoption of these voice-enabled digital assistance in the home? And part of it, I guess, I'm also wondering about is how do you think about your relationships with the partners? And if the device base broadens out, does your leverage with the partners change? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : It's a good question, Heather. Voice, it's important to remember, voice is one input. When you look at how customers interact, they obviously are interacting more and more naturally, seamlessly across a set of screens, computing works and context for them. And even then when they asked voice queries, the response always what they need is not voice alone. Think about walking into a store and if you could only ask using voice and the person has to reply in voice what all is in the store. So that model applies. So we expect a lot of continual experiences across screens, across modalities. So it's a big opportunity. I think it's opening up newer ways in which we are working with partners. I spoke earlier about the kind of experiences we are now able to drive at Walmart and Target, which we could have done a year before. Thanks to voice, how we are using it in the Google Assistant and how we are driving these partnerships. So there's a lot of excitement about how we can do all of this differently. So we are using this as a good way to rethink everything we are doing with the caveat that voice still, overall, is an emerging category compared to how users use our products. So there's a lot of room ahead. Heather Bellini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Hey, I like to \u2013 maybe discuss a couple of your growth businesses. First, on cloud. Maybe you could talk about some of the wins you're seeing and why people are necessarily choosing Google and the momentum there? And then, secondly, on the hardware business. It feels a little confusing on what your real goal is there. Is that to build a real independent separate hardware business? And how the Android relationships are going around that? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : First on cloud. Effectively, we are seeing strong momentum. And we already hear from customers that we have outstanding technology. So the reason we win deals in many cases is because we have superior technology and people also see the room ahead, thanks to a lead in machine learning. And that's an area where I think we'll continue to drive advantage. The main area where we need to get better is to scale our go-to-market and be in more places to effectively get more customers. And we are doing that a few different ways, Diane and team have really skilled our global sales force. But more importantly, I think we are striking a lot of important partnerships with leading technology vendors to scale and reach more customers. And so be the partnership at Cisco that we announced or, in this quarter, we also teamed up with Pivotal and VMware. And earlier the year, you saw us partner with SAP. And all of this help customers more easily run their apps, both on-prem and in the cloud. And we are doing this all in a open way with Kubernetes. So that's the overall strategy, and I think that's really beginning to pay off. And you will see us scale across all these dimensions for cloud in the year ahead. In terms of hardware, we are very seriously committed to making hardware. Few reasons. Hardware is \u2013 the intersection of hardware and software is how you drive computing forward. And historically, hardware has been maybe a single device business. For a long while, it was PCs then maybe plus smartphones. But you're clearly entering an era where you going to have different types of computing experiences. And so to do that and to stitch it all together across, I think it's important we thoughtfully put our opinion forward. We're equally committed to working with the ecosystems and we provide the same basis on both sides, be it Android or Chrome. And it's going really well. Our close partnership this quarter across a set of Android partners. You see great momentum at the recently launched Samsung Note 8. We announced ARCore on Samsung devices. So we have strong momentum there as well. So we're committed to pushing forward hard on all these areas. Justin Post : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is now open. Ross Sandler : Hi. I had a question for either Sundar or Ruth. It's just a philosophical question on TAC. So as the mobile search market matures, particularly in the Western markets, the question is, why does Google feel like it needs to pay any TAC to partners at all? Is the lesson learned from the Firefox, desktop partner loss a couple of years ago was that you didn't lose any revenue and you stopped paying TAC on that agreement, why wouldn't the same logic apply to mobile search? If not now, at some point in the future? Sundar Pichai : Look, I mean, first of all, we have a lot of experience in this area. We've been doing distribution deals for our search for well over a decade and I personally been involved all the way from the toolbar in the Chrome days. So by now, first of all, we want to construct a win-win construct. So we always want to construct in which we do better when our partners to better. And so doing TAC well aligns us in that way and, historically, it has driven a lot of growth. And so it's a model we understand. We understand the key economics behind it. And so we are very thoughtful about how we drive it forward. So we are driving it forward in a way in which we know it's going to give strong both revenue and earnings growth. And so I think we are pretty comfortable with how we are approaching it and so we'll continue to do that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just the first one, a little bit on growing Alphabet's multi-app ecosystem. Sundar, how do you think about the strategic importance to drive Chrome and Google Assistant app installs and user growth on non-Android mobile platforms? Maybe talk about how you evaluate, how you're doing there so far? And then bigger picture. You've made large and exciting investment in growth opportunities across Google and Other Bets. I'd be curious to hear philosophically, how do you evaluate these opportunities and talk about some of the ROI thought processes or evaluation you make when making large capital allocation decisions? Sundar Pichai : So, on the first one. One of the unique things about how we approach product development is we've always, at Google, care about building our products for everyone. And be it Search or Gmail or Google Photos or Chrome, we work hard to drive it across all platforms. Obviously, some products, their ability to make it work well on other platforms versus our native platforms, there are differences and so we understand that. It's partly why we are very committed to driving success on our platforms, both through the ecosystem and our hardware efforts as well. So we think about it holistically. But you'll continue to see us put a lot of effort into other platforms as well. For example, over the past couple of years, I think we've meaningfully improved our products on iOS, as an example. On the other part, maybe Ruth, do you want to give color. I would just say, at a high level, we drive our investments because we think about it from a user perspective first. We see areas where there are clear user problems and we think about whether we can use computer science and our technology advantage as Google and Alphabet to give a differentiated offering for users. And we do that and then we think long-term. But that's how we do about it. Maybe Ruth can give more color there, too. Ruth Porat : And then the numbers flow out of that, which is we look over a multi-year period. A lot of the things that we're doing are multi-year investments, and that's why we stress repeatedly that we're looking at what are the long-term needs and opportunities that we could be addressing, if we're doing that well, we're delivering long-term revenue and earnings growth. And those investments need to be seeded early for them to continue to grow and flourish around the globe. Whether that responds to the first question on what's going on in APAC or across Alphabet more broadly, we take a multi-year look. We look at the business, technical, financial milestones along the way, and we allocate resources in order to make sure we're maximizing the long-term potential to deliver as we see is appropriate. Brian Nowak : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Michael B. Nathanson: Thank you. I have two for Sundar, one on HTC. It's kind of interesting thing that you didn't buy the company, but you bought talent. And I wonder, what does that move directly give you? And what did you think was lacking, I guess, from the product side before you made that move? Then I had one on YouTube. Sundar Pichai : On HTC, as we were working on our hardware efforts, we've been working with HTC very closely on the Pixel phones. So across the two companies, we saw a win-win construct, by which we could bring the team and the IP and other assets related to the Pixel business in-house. And it also allows HTC to focus better on their phones and the other products they're working on. So it just made a lot of sense to do it. And I would also think about the overall capability we are getting, not just to make phones, but as we get into other product categories, like Google Home, VR and so on, right? And so it's important to continue to build that out. And the talent we saw there is definitely best-in-class. Michael B. Nathanson: Okay. And then on DIRECTV \u2013 sorry, YouTube TV. It's clear that you guys have pretty good momentum, 50 markets already. I wonder, what has surprised you about the early consumer engagements? Anything you could share about early findings on the rollout of YouTube TV? Sundar Pichai : Yeah, main thing I would say is the consumer feedback, I think there's always been this promise on being able to, just like today on Google Search when you want something, we make it so easy for you to find it. Bringing that kind of a seamless experience on to TV, when you think about something you want to watch, making it seamless. And so, improving that process, I think, is really what people positively comment on. Other things are being able to personalize it, bringing our machine learning-based recommendations over time. So that's how people notice. They get content, in which they are interested in, surfaced much better. So I think given where we are, I'm really excited at the initial reception. And we are gathering a lot of feedback, bringing it to more markets, and I'm going to work hard at making the product better. Michael B. Nathanson: Okay. Thanks, Sundar. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Daniel Salmon : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, I'd like to just follow-up on an earlier question about e-commerce and specifically, a trend we see growing across the ecosystem of applying e-commerce data to targeting advertising. Maybe if you could describe how you view that at a high level and whether that's important to you, and growing that opportunity across all of your platforms. And perhaps, shed some light on areas where you may be able to tap into that. You discussed partnerships with retailers, Android Pay. You're tracking off-line conversions more, even a product like Customer Match would seem like it'd be an opportunity to have your advertisers bring that type of data to the table. Would love to hear a little bit more about your thoughts on that? Sundar Pichai : It's a good question, Dan. You kind of partially answered it. So you're welcome to come and work on our e-commerce team anytime. To us, as a vertical, we see huge opportunities there. There's a lot of flywheel effects we see. Almost all e-commerce providers are really interested in, like, cloud for obvious reasons. So we see tremendous traction by which we are \u2013 we can talk to them about cloud. They're already advertising partners. They're beginning to work with us much more closely on driving a seamless shopping experience. We're working on payments. And so, it creates a nice flywheel effect, and we can do this globally across all the countries we do it in. And so, we are treating it more thoughtfully and investing in addressing the vertical opportunity we see in front of us, and we'll continue working on that. Daniel Salmon : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Colin Alan Sebastian : Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple of follow-ups. First on TAC, wondering if changes in partner agreements, since those are one of the key drivers of the increase in TAC, could we then see the rate of TAC growth moderate as you anniversary those deals? And then, secondly, as it relates to voice and visual search inputs, I know it's still early for Google Lens. But overall, I'm wondering what portion of those search queries are proving to be incremental to search, the search experience, or are they largely substituting for searches on screens? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So in terms of TAC, as I indicated, we've got a couple of things going on. We're pleased with our strong partnerships. We continue to stress the impact from the shift to mobile. And again, both Sundar and I have said it, our focus remains on the profit dollar growth. And we've got a really nice position and a strong growth area. So that's what you're seeing here. But as I also said, we do expect it to increase some from here. And you've got a couple of factors going on. Sundar Pichai : On the second thing, look, I think based on every metric we see users' information needs are only going up. And the amount of information they deal with are increasing. And as we add new modalities, it really drives a better experience for them. Google Lens, there's a long way to go. But today, as humans, visual input is really big for us. I mean, it's a lot higher bandwidth than everything else. And so bringing back to computing, I think, is a really important step in advancing how users can process information. And so I see that as an important step. And thanks to machine learning, we'll be able to do these things a lot more powerfully. All of this I think, overall, adds to the search experience. And so I view that as all incremental, but it'll play out slowly over many years. And so we see this as a big opportunity ahead and we are investing for it. Colin Alan Sebastian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Thanks. Good afternoon. The revenue growth was one of the highest growth rates you've seen in five years. I'm just curious if there was something that surprised you in the quarter or something that perhaps was an anomaly that we should be thinking about modeling going forward? Ruth Porat : So I tried to give you a bit of color going across the major lines. We feel we're really pleased with the sites' revenue growth, the performance in mobile desktop and YouTube. I think if you just go down to the big categories, network revenue also was quite strong. I think one thing to add there is programmatic continues to be a strong contributor. Generate significant growth, we've talked about that on prior calls. Given all the ongoing advertiser adoption of programmatic buying and AdMob continues to see strength. What you're also seeing here is the traditional AdSense businesses. Overall, the pace of advertiser migration to programmatic affects this business kind of quarter-on-quarter as well as the policy changes that we've talked about in prior quarters. And those factors were less of a drag in the last couple of quarters. So you actually saw nicer revenue growth year-on-year here as well. It was up 16%. And then Sundar's talked a lot about the components of other revenues up nicely. We're really pleased with what's going on there and then, on top of that, Other Bets. So we've got a couple of components to it and tried to give you color on each one. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Thank you. So Sundar, can you talk about how Google is positioning in the emerging markets over the longer term can be different versus what we are used to seeing here in the States. I mean, you talked about Tez in India, and that's just type of stuff that we're not even seeing here in the States. So is there a broader opportunity for you to do a larger land grab with more products? And Ruth, should we assume that the relative size of the dollar contribution to the other revenue growth happened in the order you gave out in the prepared remarks, I guess, cloud, play, hardware? And if so, this would make it the second quarter in a row in which cloud is showing up as the largest contributor, I guess, as opposed to the third. So any perspective you can share in terms of the relative growth you maybe seeing recently? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On emerging markets, we do see a differentiated opportunity there partly because the characteristics of how truly many of these markets came mobile first, I think, gives rise to different ways users are adopting our products. And also, more importantly, the ecosystem, which is built around, so for example, if you take e-commerce, the kind of models that are emerging in these countries are also a bit different. So I think we see a way to look at these markets with a lot more thought and address them for the opportunity that they have, not just apply our global products there. So I think that's what led us to do Google Tez in India. And we'll thoughtfully look at the opportunities in that region and invest a lot in the years ahead. Ruth Porat : And then we do \u2013 we did list them in the order in which they're making a contribution. It's obviously a mix of businesses. As we've talked about, we have very strong growth in each of cloud and hardware that was tempered by slightly slower growth in Q3 for Play, reflecting what's the hit-driven nature of that business of gaming. But again, feel really pleased with the progress, momentum that we're seeing in the various businesses. And I guess, the only other thing to notice, obviously, is seasonality on the hardware as we move into the fourth quarter here. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any closing remarks. Ellen West : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ellen West : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now, I\u2019ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2016 filed with the SEC. Undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements and they are made are made based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thanks, Ellen. We had a fantastic 2017 with total revenues of $110.9 billion, up 23% over 2016 and operating income of $28.9 billion up 22% year-on-year excluding the EC fine. Our momentum reflects the relentless focus on users, advertisers and enterprise customers as well as the benefits of our commitment to long-term investing. For the fourth quarter, revenues of $32.3 billion were up 24% year-on-year. The ongoing very strong performance in sites revenue in particular reflects the combined benefits of innovation and secular growth with mobile search again leading the way. Healthy growth in network revenues was again led by our programmatic business. Substantial growth in other revenues, mainly hardware, cloud and Play continues to highlight the benefits of our investments. Our outline for today\u2019s call is, first, I\u2019ll view the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. In order to facilitate comparisons of this quarter\u2019s results to prior periods, we have also provided the tax affected line items, excluding the impact of the U.S. tax legislation enacted at the end of 2017. You can see the components in our earnings press release. Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. I will then conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions. Starting with the summary of Alphabet\u2019s consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenues of $32.3 billion were up 24% year-over-year and strong across all regions. U.S. revenues were $15.4 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $10.3 billion, up 24% year-over-year. In fixed FX terms, EMEA grew 22%, reflecting strengthening of both the euro and the British pound. APAC revenues were $4.7 billion, up 30% versus last year and up 32% in fixed FX terms, reflecting weakening of the Japanese yen. Other Americas revenues were $1.9 billion, up 31% year-over-year and up 30% in fixed FX terms, reflecting strengthening of the Canadian dollar. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I\u2019ll discuss in the Google segment results, was $14.3 billion, up 34% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.8 billion, up 34% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically, costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, hardware-related costs for our expanded Made by Google family of products and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube. Operating expenses were $10.4 billion, up 19% year-over-year, in particular, reflecting an increase in marketing spend, given the holiday season. Stock-based compensation totaled $1.8 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 80,110, up 2,009 people from last quarter. As in prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count additions were once again made in cloud for both technical and sales roles, consistent with the priority we place on this business. Operating income was $7.7 billion, up 15% versus last year, and the operating margin was 24%. Other income and expense was $354 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our provision for income taxes on a reported basis includes $9.9 billion for items associated with the U.S. tax legislation, resulting in a reported net loss of $3 billion and loss per diluted share of $4.35. Excluding the impact of the U.S. tax legislation, our effective tax rate was 15%. Our net income was $6.8 billion and earnings per diluted share were $9.70. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $4.3 billion. Operating cash flow was $10.3 billion with free cash flow of $6 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $102 billion. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $31.9 billion, up 24% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $22.2 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by solid growth from desktop search and strong performance from YouTube. Network revenues were $5 billion, up 13% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $4.7 billion, up 38% year-over-year, fueled by hardware, cloud and Play. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release. Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.5 billion or 24% of total advertising revenues and up 33% year-over-year. The increase in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up year-over-year, reflecting primarily an increase in the sites TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The underlying trend affecting the network TAC rate year-over-year continues to be the shift to programmatic which carries higher TAC. Google\u2019s stock-based compensation totaled $1.7 billion for the year, up 1% year-over-year. Operating income was $8.8 billion, up 11% versus last year and the operating margin was 27%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $3.8 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction. Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. I\u2019ll cover results for the full-year 2017 because it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon, as discussed on prior calls. Results for the quarter are in our earnings release. For the full-year 2017, Other Bets revenues were $1.2 billion, up 49% versus 2016, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber, and Verily. Operating loss was $3.4 billion for the full-year 2017 versus an operating loss of $3.6 billion in 2016. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $507 million, down from $1.4 billion in 2016, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber. We\u2019re pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates. Nest turned in a strong holiday performance in the fourth quarter across an expanded family of products in energy, safety and security. In 2017, Nest products also became available in 12 new countries, more than double the number in 2016. Verily wrapped up its first field study seeking to reduce the transmission of the diseases through mosquitoes with positive results. And just last week, Onduo, a joint venture between Verily and Sanofi began a limited commercial launch of its diabetes management platform. At Waymo, progress is accelerating. For example, Waymo surpassed 4 million miles of driving in the real world, taking only six months to achieve the last million miles compared to that 18 months for our first million miles. And in November, Waymo announced that it is the only company to have a fleet of driverless cars on public roads that are completely autonomous without anyone in the driver\u2019s seat. Let me close with some observations on our priorities and longer term outlook. Our 23% revenue growth in 2017 was powered in particular by the ongoing extraordinary performance of our sites business. Both mobile and desktop search continue to grow and benefit from our approach to innovation with strong momentum as we identify additional opportunities to enhance the user and advertiser experience. As we\u2019ve consistently emphasized, alongside the continued momentum in our advertising business, we are focused on building a second wave of growth within Google over the medium and long-term which includes the rapidly growing revenue businesses in Google, cloud, hardware and YouTube. With respect to cloud, we\u2019re seeing the benefits of a fully featured enterprise offering and an expanded go-to-market team, bringing our advantages in infrastructure, data analytics, security and machine learning to more customers. And we are pleased with the momentum in our hardware business in 2017, driven by an expansion in both our product line and geographic availability. Finally, as we look further into the future for our third wave of growth, we remain excited about the longer term potential for our Other Bets businesses. Overall, operating income was up 22% year-over-year in 2017, excluding the impact of the EC fine, although there was obviously fluctuation in the rate operating income growth quarter-to-quarter. Within cost of revenues, the biggest component is traffic acquisition costs, reflecting our strong revenue growth in mobile search and the fact that mobile search carries higher TAC than our desktop business. While we expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenue, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, we anticipate that the pace of year-over-year growth in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue will slow after the first quarter of 2018. Within OpEx, we are keenly focused on prioritization in order to optimize the resources we\u2019re investing for longer-term growth. As I discussed on last quarter\u2019s call, marketing spend in the fourth quarter is significantly elevated, in particular supporting hardware but also across cloud and YouTube. For 2018, we remain excited about the investments we are making to drive the next phase of growth in our big bets in Google in cloud, hardware and YouTube, and our machine learning efforts which are powering innovation across our businesses. You will see us continue to support our priority areas with increased headcount which will remain concentrated in R&D. With the closing of our deal with HTC earlier this week for example, we\u2019ve added 2,000 employees to support our hardware business. With respect to SBC, we\u2019ve completed the transition to a single annual compensation cycle for employees with a full year equity refresh grant to employees in the first quarter of 2018. Our biannual grant to SVPs will also occur in the first quarter and you will see the combined step up in our first quarter results. For our Other Bets in 2018, we will continue to calibrate the magnitude and pace of investment appropriate to their individual execution path. Finally, our framework for capital allocation is unchanged from our prior discussions. The primary use of cash continues to be to support organic growth in the business. We are excited about the significant opportunities we\u2019ve identified in our businesses and continue to invest appropriately. We then layer in a sensitivity analysis regarding potential M&A as well as CapEx, in particular computing infrastructure, to support the needs of these growing businesses. The most sizable catalyst for added investment in compute power include the expanding application of machine learning efforts across Alphabet as well as additional requirements for Google\u2019s Cloud, Search and YouTube businesses. This framework further considers complimentary uses such as the share repurchase. After taking these potential investments into account, our Board has decided to extend our share repurchase program up to an additional 8.6 billion of Class C capital stock. In conclusion, 2017 was another great year and we are very excited about the opportunities ahead. I will now turn it over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Ruth. Our teams are off to a great start in 2018. This year is special as it\u2019ll mark 20 years since Google was founded. A lot has changed but our mission organizing the world\u2019s information and making it universally accessible and useful remains the best guide for the next 10 years. Technology is an incredibly dynamic industry. We\u2019ve been laying a foundation for the next decade as we pivot to an AI first company, powering the next generation of Google products like the Google Assistant. And we have been making substantial investments in our three biggest bets, cloud, YouTube and hardware. These bets have enormous potential and already they are showing real momentum and gaining traction. Today, I\u2019ll start by sharing some of the exciting progress in these three big bets. First, Google Cloud. Google Cloud, which includes Google Cloud Platform and G Suite, has reached meaningful scale, and I\u2019m excited to share today that it\u2019s already $1 billion per quarter business. In fact, we believe that Google Cloud Platform, based on publicly reported data for the 12 months ending December 2017, is the fastest growing major public cloud provider in the world. We are also increasingly doing larger, more strategic deals with customers. In fact, the number of deals worth over a $1 million across all cloud products more than tripled from 2016 to 2017. The strength of our products and the value of working with Google is increasingly clear to partners and customers. In the fourth quarter, we forged new and deepened existing partnerships with industry leaders including Cisco for open hybrid enrollments, Salesforce for customer insights and productivity, and SAP for AI and data insights across their products. These collaborations span our entire company from engineering integration to marketing programs to joint sales, and they cover Google Cloud Platform, G Suite and Google Analytics. We also saw accelerating customer traction on our wins [ph] included global brands like Bed Bath & Beyond, then to Dentsu Aegis Network Aegis Network, Keller Williams, Mattel and Tyco Retail Solutions. And underscoring the increasing importance of Google Cloud to the enterprise, we surpassed another new milestone, 4 million paying customers on G Suite. Next, YouTube. Every month more than 1.5 billion people come to YouTube to watch their favorite content on channels ranging from the Ellen Show which has more than 22 million subscribers to the NBA with over 8 million subscribers to SciShow, a really popular educational channel with more than 4.5 million subscribers. In fact, there are over 1 billion learning related video views everyday on YouTube. I learned that this week. With all this great content, people are thinking of YouTube more as a key part of their TV viewing experience. For Tuesday night State of the Union, more partners used YouTube to live stream the address than ever before, generating 5 million live views. And just yesterday, we announced a partnership with Major League Soccer\u2019s LA Football Club, YouTube TV will be the exclusive home to watch all locally televised English language matches in addition to their original programming and content. YouTube TV is now also available on Roku. There is great momentum around the world with localized versions of YouTube now in 90 countries in 80 different languages. Just this morning, we announced that we are expanding the popular YouTube Go app to over 130 countries around the globe. The app has great data usage transparency and controls built in, which is especially useful for people living in regions with limited connectivity. In the fourth quarter, we also strengthened our relationship with the music industry, signing new licensing deals with Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. We also partnered with Ticketmaster to help fans by tickets to see their favorite artists perform live. Third, our growing hardware business. Our Made by Google hardware products were very popular this holiday season. Device shipments in the fourth quarter have more than doubled year-over-year. Our retail partners also saw strong performance. Our devices are available in stores like Best Buy, Target and Walmart. I\u2019m especially excited about the popularity of our Google devices for the home like the Google Home, Mini, Max and Chromecast. In the last year, we have sold tens of millions of these devices and counting. I want to call out the great work of our marketing and design teams. Our hardware is beautiful individually and as a family, and people love discovering the unique features like the built-in Google Assistant. Earlier this week, we officially closed our deal with HTC, which will bring great talent to drive even more innovation in the years to come. Turning to our efforts in machine learning. Our AI research and innovation leads the world. Our mission to better organize the world\u2019s information has been transformed by these technologies with our Search products and the Google Assistant at the heart. There is great momentum around the Google Assistant as we bring it to more people on more devices. It\u2019s now available on more than 400 million devices including speakers like Google Home as well as Android phones and tablets, iPhones, headphones, televisions, watches and more. People love to use the Assistant on all these devices. There was a lot of excitement around the Google Assistant at CES from partners and consumers where we brought the Assistant to new surfaces like smart displays from brands like JBL and Lenovo as well as Android Auto which is now available in more than 400 car models from brands like GM, Hyundai and Volvo. One area that\u2019s really benefiting from our advancements in AI is photography. The Pixel 2 phone is the leader in video rankings by industry standards, with smoother and clearer videos, thanks to machine learning and our video stabilization technique. And Google Photos continues to grow from strength to strength. On New Year\u2019s Eve alone, over 3 billion photos and videos were uploaded to Google Photos. More broadly, we want everyone to be able to use machine learning for their own needs. We recently gave Google Cloud customers, access to AutoML which makes it far easier to build complex new enrollments. Since it launched a few weeks ago, over 10,000 customers have already signed up to try it. Lastly, I\u2019ll give a quick update on our computing and advertising platforms. First, Android. To provide a better, more tailored experience for our next billion users, we made Android Oreo Go edition available for our device partners. This year, we expect to see Go devices from dozens of manufacturers and with great support from mobile operators and app developers around the world. I\u2019m confident that this will bring the power of smartphones to many more people for the first time. Google Play is also growing well. Just last week, we introduced audiobooks, so you can now catch up on your favorite books any time on multiple devices. And in Latin America, number of unique monthly buyers on Google Play grew by over 50% year-over-year in 2017. Chromebooks also continue to gain momentum and traction. Third-party research tells us that fourth quarter sales of consumer Chromebooks in the U.S. grew by over 70% year-over-year. Moving to our advertising platforms which help large and small businesses. As shoppers turned to their mobile phones this holiday shopping season, Google was central to helping them discover new brands, compare products and find the best deals. We redesigned the mobile shopping experience on Google, brining more product information to the forefront like reviews and ratings. We are also making the payments experience simpler, safer and more consistent. We brought our payments efforts together as a new Google Pay, which shoppers can use to pay online, in stores and across Google products like Chrome and the Play Store. Companies like Airbnb and Instacart are using Google Pay to speedup mobile checkout. And HotelTonight found that customers using Google Pay are 65% more likely to complete their bookings. We also have really strong momentum in app promotion ads. The majority of our app promotion campaigns are now using Universal App campaigns which is part of our focus on simplifying the advertiser experience. Additionally, we introduced a new playable ad format in Google Play that allows users to sample games before they install. Ads in Google Play are performing really well for developers. And our app promotion business on YouTube is flourishing. We launched major initiatives such as store visit measurement and location-based ad formats to drive online to offline commerce. We are focused on making sure YouTube is a great place for users and advertisers while helping creators earn money from popular content. In addition to the significant work we are doing to product users and stop abuse on the platform, just a few weeks ago, we announced changes to advertising on YouTube, including stricter monetization criteria, new manual reviews for all videos in Google Preferred and simpler controls for marketers. The feedback we have received from advertisers and creators so far has been really positive. So, as you can see, we are making great strides in our biggest bets, and I\u2019m proud of the work we are doing across the Company. I\u2019m also incredibly proud that as Google grows, we are making significant contributions to our partners, the economy and our local communities. Our business continues to benefit our partners around the world. This includes news publishers, app developers and YouTube creators, who we share revenue with. Over the last four years, our partners have earned over $100 billion; that\u2019s incredible and we are working on new ways to drive even more value to our partners. In the U.S. specifically, we have offices and data centers across 21 states and we plan to hire thousands of people across the U.S. this year. Last year in the U.S., we grew faster outside the Bay Area than in the Bay Area. To support this growth, we will be making significant investments in offices across nine states including Colorado and Michigan. We will also be building or opening five big new data centers in the U.S. And with digital skills and high demand by employers, our Grow with Google initiative will have job seekers and small businesses gain education and skills to help them succeed. Just a couple of weeks ago, we announced that we are creating an IT support certification program that will give thousands of people scholarships and job opportunities. More than 10,000 people have already signed up, which is amazing. I want to thank all our employees, Google users, partners and advertisers around the world. I couldn\u2019t be more excited about what\u2019s in store for all of us this year. With that I\u2019ll hand it back over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe two, one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, coming out of CES and the success you had with Google Home and the Google Assistant during the holiday period based on the blog post you guys put out, can you identify some of the key investments in either partnerships or hardware or capabilities that you\u2019re targeting over the next one to two years to make sure the momentum around Assistant is sustained? And then, Ruth, looking at cost of goods sold that came in quite a bit higher than we thought, and you were lapping one-time charge, if we have it right, versus the year-ago period. Maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the pressures in cost of goods sold that were either seasonal or maybe a new normal in terms of higher level, going forward? Any color there would be really appreciated. Sundar Pichai : On the Google Assistant and Google Home we are very excited about the momentum we saw in CES. It actually reflects work we\u2019ve been doing for a while. Google Assistant in some ways brings together all the technology we\u2019ve been building for years, and it\u2019s an extension and it\u2019s supported by Google Search as well. We are also thinking about our capabilities broadly beyond just one device alone, and that\u2019s what we are doing here across phones, across all surfaces. So, that\u2019s something big we\u2019re focused on. And the second is we have always built ecosystems, be it Android or Chrome or Chromebooks. We work with many, many partners and scale up things, right. And so we are leveraging those best practices and trying to build this in a way in which the entire ecosystem can ship products with the Google Assistant and generate value. So, I think the framework is great, and long-term, our investments in AI will directly manifest its capabilities for users through the Google Assistant. So, I\u2019m very bullish on it. Ruth Porat : And then, in terms of gross margins, it obviously reflects our product mix. And as you know well, the TAC rate for each of sites network as a percentage of revenue lines, that\u2019s continued to increase because they\u2019re our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic and so carry higher TAC. But, as I indicated in my opening comments, we do estimate that the year-on-year increase in the sites TAC rate will slow after the first quarter of 2018. And then, the other thing to note, other cost of revenue does reflect the seasonality of hardware, having increased both the number of products and the Made by Google family as well as continuing to expand geographically in western Europe and APAC, you can see that reflected here. Operator : And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Two quick questions, one for Ruth, and Sundar. I guess, Ruth, just to follow up on your comments there, the partner agreements which you just cited.. Is there any color you could give us on how these typically work? And what I mean by that is are they typically multiyear deals on average? And how do we think about these impacting the rate of change in TAC, since you are talking about the pace of growth in TAC as we look out, call it in year two if these are multiyear deals? And then, for Sundar, I guess, I wanted to follow up a little bit with what we saw at CES. But, how do you think about voice? And given the significant number of devices in the market, how do you think in the future about traffic acquisition strategies on these devices, as you look five years down the road? Is there any reason to think that the strategies might be different that you are going to follow as you look ahead, than what we\u2019ve seen over the past, call it since the advent of the iPhone? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So, on your first question, there is not much really that I\u2019m going to be able to add there. I mean, given the ongoing momentum in our mobile search business, this does continue to be relevant, as you look forward, given mobile carry\u2019s higher TAC. But, the rate, as per your question, has also reflected changes and partnership agreement. So, all factors considered, we expect the year-on-year increases will slow after the first quarter of \u201818. And as I\u2019ve said on many of these calls, we are very pleased to have a very strong position in a rapidly growing market and that momentum does continue. I guess, the only other thing to add is that Q4 TAC as a percentage of revenue does benefit from the fact that the fourth quarter is a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube. So, quarter-on-quarter changes are less insightful because CAC is distinct from TAC. It\u2019s not in this number but not much more to add there. Pass it to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : And Heather on voice, we are very excited by voice. We obviously see it being adopted strongly in countries like India; it\u2019s actually a significant part of just mobile search queries in general. And things like Google Assistant and doing Google Home kind of really accelerates the trend. But, we definitely see more multimodality. So, as you saw, we also announced many smart displays at CES. And I think that will be an exciting trend as well. So, we will bet on all of that. In general, I think about -- we want to be there for users when they need us and we want to serve everyone. This is why we work across the ecosystem, we do first party devices, we do it globally, and so, we are committed to doing that well. So, I think, it will be an extension of how we have approached search from day one and trying to serve everyone. And so, I don\u2019t overall see a big shift. Operator : And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Douglas Anmuth : Some big news earlier this week just in terms of Waymo with FCA talking about delivering thousands of minivans to Waymo later in the year. So, I was hoping Ruth, you could just talk to us more about the timing for that business and how we should think about the economic model there, as you move to operations and deployment phase. And then, secondly, the cash now obviously much more accessible in terms of what is held overseas, could you just talk more about your plans there? Obviously, the bigger buyback there but still not meaningful in terms of the overall size of the company. Ruth Porat : Sure. So, first on Waymo, we do remain very excited about the opportunity with Waymo and our continued progress on multiple fronts, in particular the rider program in Phoenix we\u2019re excited about and we\u2019re expanding our testing to more states. In November, we announced that Waymo\u2019s self-driving TAC reached a major milestone, becoming the only company to have a fleet of driverless cars on public roads that are completely autonomous. And that builds on our more than 4 million test miles driven in the real world in seven states, 25 U.S. cities, we\u2019re currently driving, self-driving I should say, 10,000 miles every day with billions of miles in simulation and robust testing at our private facilities. So, to your question, we do continue to explore a range of options beyond the program, we\u2019re piloting in Phoenix including ride sharing and personal use vehicles, logistics, deliveries and working with cities to help them address public transportation objectives. That being said, our first commercial application is the ride service that we will launch in 2018 that would be open to members of the public in Phoenix and riders will be able to use the Waymo app to have one of our fully driving -- self-driving cars without a driver at the wheel. So, we are very excited about that. And then, in terms of cash, I think the main point as we think about it is there is no change in our approach to our capital allocation framework. We\u2019ve consistently been focused on long-term investing. We talked a lot about that already on this call and our framework has been therefore very consistent. The priority, the first use is organic, it is investing in the many opportunities that we have. And the second is strategic. And we do remain active with smaller M&A deals, in particular to support our cloud business and hardware. The HTC deal which we just closed is a good example of that. Third is CapEx. So, we continue to invest in machines to support growth we see across Google but in particular supporting Cloud, Search, YouTube and all that we are doing in machine learning. And then, finally that leads to return on capital. And when we considered all of that that\u2019s led us to extend -- have the Board extend share repurchase program which we announced a couple of years ago. And we will let you determine what that number represents in true Google fashion. But it\u2019s just a modest increase to what we have been doing previously. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : I have two. The first one, Ruth, you called out desktop search, I think the second straight quarter as being relatively strong. Could you just talk about some of the drivers of the strength in desktop? And how do you think about the sustainability of continued strong desktop growth in the 2018 and beyond? The second one kind of a question on search query volume. There is often speculation and question marks around how consumer behavior is changing in ecommerce and weather Google is still capturing as many ecommerce searches. Could you just talk to what you are seeing in retail search query volumes and search user growth within ecommerce in the United States? Sundar Pichai : Overall, look, we -- obviously Search is very broad. And even when you talk about commercial thing, we serve across many, many categories including things like from travel to hotels and to services to products and so on. So, we are very, very comprehensive. And obviously, ecommerce is evolving a lot and we continue to invest there. Google shopping is doing well. And we work hard to make sure we bring the best experience possible, which is why I said [ph] they were also Search and Assistant we partner with companies like Walmart for example to make it much easier to buy products and so on. So, we invested a lot there. You are right, consumer behavior is changing but we are comfortable given the breadth of how we do things and how we are focused on user experience there. Ruth Porat : And on your question on desktop, there really isn\u2019t one particular item to call out here. And that\u2019s why last quarter, I tried to walk through the process that our team goes through and the way they look at innovation, really stepping back and recognizing that the way we all use smartphones and desktop is continuing to evolve. So, therefore, there is utility and challenging assumptions about evolving user behavior and advertiser preferences, and that opens new lines of inquiry which benefits not just mobile but also desktop. And desktop did deliver solid revenue growth. It does remain an important form factor for certain more complex tasks such as planning vacations or assessing insurance options. And we are pleased with the ongoing strength. I\u2019ll leave it to you to do any of the forecasting. But, we just view it as yet another valuable form factor and are really pleased with the performance there. Operator : And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore. Anthony DiClemente : Thanks for taking my questions. One for Sundar and for Ruth. Sundar, on YouTube, you mentioned that 1.5 billion people come to YouTube. Any other information you can give us there on user growth or engagement trends would be great, anything on time spent, I mean particularly as YouTube becomes more mature and mobile video particularly in North America gets more competitive. And then, also on YouTube, anything around new products or features driving the monetization or ad business? And then, Ruth, just a question on the growth in marketing spend in the fourth quarter. I think you said that the 4Q was significantly elevated. Should we interpret that to mean that the growth rate in selling and marketing year-over-year should decelerate off the 4Q? And then, just related to that, you\u2019re getting a good return on investment from this marketing spend, particularly when you think about media mix and all the spend that we\u2019ve seen on TV as compared to digital marketing? Sundar Pichai : Look, on YouTube, we are continuing to see great momentum. Maybe one area which for example highlights how well it\u2019s doing is if you think about YouTube on TV, people actually want watching YouTube on the big screen, our growth has been significant there. And so, increasingly people use YouTube for -- we see it being used to across every possible use case. And I said it earlier in the call. Every day, we get over a 1 billion user on educational content alone. People use it to go, catch upon sports, music, entertainment. And so, you can think about the breadth of -- historically, YouTube has been very strong on mobile and continues to strong on mobile. It\u2019s doing particularly well in the next billion user markets. Our growth last year was very strong there, which is why we supported it with investments like YouTube Go. And we are seeing it now grow well-beyond mobile, especially in the leaving room. So, a lot of momentum there. Ruth Porat : And then, in terms of sales and marketing, as I said, it particularly supported hardware but was also supporting Cloud and YouTube. And as both, Sundar and I\u2019ve said, these are important Google growth areas for us and we are investing to support growth in the business. The elevated levels this quarter did reflect both seasonality and strategic decision to invest in these brands. And so, view it as a very important part of the overall investment and what we view as very sizeable opportunities. And it\u2019s both supporting the brand and the momentum therefore going into 2018, but this is very specific product focus as well. Operator : And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Daniel Salmon : Sundar, I\u2019ll go with the European theme. First, curious to hear your thoughts on the potential impact of GDPR, maybe both on your own sites and properties and how any business practices may need to be adjusted for that but also for tools like customer match that you are advertisers may use. And then, second, I\u2019ll take a shot at it. Any updates on your dialogue with the EU officials and regulators on the proceeding there? Sundar Pichai : Good question. I was just in Europe last week, it was exciting to be there. There is clearly momentum we feel in terms of how Europe is doing. And we are very committed to the region. We are opening new offices there. We announced AI center. We are committed to hiring more engineers and supporting staff there. So, it\u2019s an important market for us. On things like GDPR, we want to be -- we have been thoughtfully engaged there. I think it\u2019s important to put privacy first for European citizens, and we are very supportive of the work that\u2019s underway there. And we are committed to complying with GDPR across all the services that we provide in Europe. There is still time. As a reminder, it doesn\u2019t go into effect until May or so. And we are working to make sure all our products are ready. And we will work hard to make the transition well. In terms of -- again, with the European Commission, we have long had constructive conversations. We are understanding their concerns and responding with thoughtful changes, and we will continue engaging in a thoughtful way. Operator : And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Colin Sebastian : First, Sundar, your comments on Google Cloud were upbeat. And I wonder how much of the momentum there is related to machine learning capabilities offered as service. If you could frame just how important that is for the cloud business overall? And then, as a follow-up on Google Home or the voice-based assistant. If there is any update in how you are thinking about monetization from a transactional perspective, transactional model with perhaps retail partners or do you see an ad-based model emerging there as well? Sundar Pichai : On the first thing calling on cloud, particularly last quarter, we obviously brought AutoML to our Google Cloud customers. To me that shows the rate at which we are bringing our internal advances. It\u2019s just a year ago, I remember reviewing with the team and they first showed me the AutoML work, we spoke about it at Google I/O, and it\u2019s pretty cutting edge work. And to turn it back around and to provide it for everyone in the world, I think that shows the power of what we can do with Google Cloud and get our state-of-the-art and get it to everyone. I think the momentum there obviously is due to our strength in machine learning, the kind of open agile development environment we provide security, and then the combination with G Suite. But above all, I think what -- we\u2019ve always -- we\u2019ve been doing cloud now for 19 years because Google itself was built on a cloud platform. But where the momentum is really coming from is over the past two years, we\u2019ve put a lot of effort to make sure we are enterprise scale ready. So, now we can handle any type of enterprise, any kind of regulatory complexity, security complexity and so on. And that\u2019s evident in the business wins we are seeing. So, we are signing customers who are very large across-the-board, globally. And I think that\u2019s driving a lot of momentum there. On your question on Google Home and voice-based assistant and how we are thinking about monetization. There are a lot of interesting ideas internally. So, teams are excited about trying new things. We see a lot of potential. But the guidance I\u2019ve given the teams is to be squarely focused on user experience. We are really getting started. I think these are going to be powerful technologies. But, there are areas where we clearly feel all of us fall short for doing right by users and getting their expectations -- matching their expectation. So, you\u2019ll see us focused on user experience there for a while to come. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Michael Nathanson : One for Sundar and one for Ruth, both on YouTube. So, first question was as Google Preferred kicks up a little heat on types of qualities that makes the cut for your videos. Do you feel you have to take a more active stance and looking at what is in Google Preferred -- sorry YouTube Preferred and how are you going to go about that? And then for Ruth, the past year was one where we heard a lot about brand safety. And I wonder when you look back at the YouTube results in 2017, is there any noticeable signs of maybe a shift in ad spending from some of the brands who were making those complaints? So, those are my questions. Sundar Pichai : I probably can talk about both as they\u2019re related. We obviously want to make sure YouTube has a great experience for users, content creators and advertisers because it supports content creators. And we took a lot of steps last year but particularly in December we adopted a new rigorous approach. And that\u2019s a much more stringent standard for creators. For example, they need 1,000 subscribers to be eligible for monetization. We are manually reviewing Google Preferred videos. We obviously use machine learning to support that a lot and they both go hand in hand. We have provided improved controls for marketers and we are also working with trusted third party vendors to assist brand suitability. So, it\u2019s a comprehensive approach to make sure all of this works well. And so, while there have been concerns but we are working really hard to address them and respond strongly. And so, I think we\u2019re focused on the long-term opportunity here and I think we are setting ourselves up well for the years ahead. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Sena of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Ken Sena : So, just a question, searches seem to be coming more qualified through travel as far as filtering the price that people want to pay, locations, amenities et cetera. Is there any trend that goes along with that in terms of maybe depressing search volume growth to some extent because of the more filtered aspect? And then, secondly, does the higher qualification trend tie in at all to the shifts towards programmatic and in terms of other parties that might be involved or the discussion that we had around TAC? And then, maybe two, just as a follow-up, if you can provide just a little bit more color on Google Pay in terms of what might be different in this round versus previous attempts? Sundar Pichai : Maybe I\u2019m not fully sure I understood all the specifics there. But, at a high level, as people are on the go, they are travelling et cetera, if anything, I think search is more invaluable than ever before. All the work we do in local searches applies incredibly when you travel, the properties we have like Google Maps et cetera, go along with it. So, overall, I think they all add up to a better user experience and hence a better opportunity for us. Google Pay turns out to be an important part of all of this. As we move from just answers to helping users complete actions about time including transactions, the ability to complete the transaction is an important part of it and which is why making sure Google Pay in a unified way works as seamlessly as possible is a big part of our long-term strategy. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Stephen Ju : So, Sundar, I think Ruth cited hardware in the prepared remarks as the largest contributor in the fourth quarter for the other revenue line. As you look at the roadmap going forward, you acquired the HTC engineers to bring that team in-house. So, looks like for the first time you have an integrated hardware and software team under one roof. So, how do you think your product development pace and strategy will change for smartphones and other devices going forward? And also, does it make sense to bring the Nest team to be more integrated into core Google as well given the drive to increase the touch points for all the Google products to other form factors? Sundar Pichai : You are right that part of the reason we are so excited about being able to bring this world-class team in-house is while we have been working together already, we have had to straddle a company boundary to do that. But now, having them as Googlers, will really make that integrated development, which is so critical for us to do it better. We bring a unique approach to hardware, the combination of AI plus software plus hardware. So, being able to get those teams working together, I think would really drive the pace forward. And the best example of that is you see the advances we have made with both still and video photography on our phones. And the Nest team is very, very closely aligned with the Google hardware team. They work hard to realize a lot of synergies there. We already shared a lot of our go-to-market efforts. And we increasingly are collaborating on product development as well. So, we collaborate closely, and I\u2019m excited at the possibilities there as well. Operator : And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Justin Post : First for Sundar, it didn\u2019t feel like there is many visible search changes this year as far as coverage or ad formats? So, I would love to hear your thoughts on search innovation pipeline as you look at the 2018 and key growth drivers going forward? And then, Ruth, in the prepared remarks, there was a lot of comments on investment in your medium-term business growth drivers, offices, data centers and other areas. And I\u2019m just wondering if you view 2018 upcoming as an investment year or kind of more of the same of what we have seen over the last couple of years? Sundar Pichai : Justin, when you think about Search, one of the ways I\u2019d encourage you to think, we think about user journeys. So, a lot of the innovation that we are doing has gone on to not just an individual query and how we respond but how we think about what our user is trying to accomplish over a series of successions. Are you trying to plan a trip and how do we do it better; do you have a health-related area where you are trying to learn more about it, and how do we help you through that. And so, it\u2019s not always just changing a specific format but understanding context better and bringing you that information through a journey. And I think so, there is a lot of innovation that\u2019s happening in that direction. And also underlying is what I said earlier, it\u2019s not just providing the answers, how do you help them get to that information and act on it. And so, maybe you found something and you want to call, call that place or maybe you are trying to order a birthday gift and we actually want you to -- want to go a step further and help that -- help you buy that gift. So, that\u2019s along the lines. And the innovation is happening across search and assistant in integrated way. Ruth Porat : And then, in terms of your investment question, we\u2019ve consistently been investing across Alphabet and we have tried to be very clear about our investment priorities, all with a view to supporting healthy, long-term growth that goes back to the inception of the Company. Year-on-year op inc growth that you have seen does include these sustained investments for all the areas that both, Sundar and I have talked about, for the year up 22% versus last year. Obviously a lot of variability in growth quarter-to-quarter. And that we just continue to be focused on doing the right things to support growth of the business. The fourth quarter does reflect the obvious seasonality. And again, we continue to look across various, their needs and try and prioritize that we can remain committed to long-term growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Ben Schachter : Just a couple of questions. Can you discuss the evolution of the business model for Waymo? You are launching the ride hailing service in Phoenix, you\u2019ve worked with manufacturers. You talked about other models. But, when you think about the sort of 5 to 10-year view of that, what will the primary business model look like? And separately, can you talk about what is interesting from a strategic point of view about the video game business? You are making some key hires there and just wondering what you think Google can bring to that industry that would be innovative. Ruth Porat : So, on Waymo, really not much more to add. We\u2019re really pleased after years of work on technology where it was really about safety, safety, safety and developing the technology and the platform. And now we are in a position where we have this opportunity to let people use and benefit from what we\u2019ve developed. So, I think that safety has been a key driver and the opportunity for cities has been really exciting what it means about optimizing resource base that they have. So, it\u2019s still very early days and we\u2019re just -- we\u2019re pleased with all the progress the team\u2019s made. But, it would be getting out of ourselves to go further out than what we\u2019ve laid out here. Sundar Pichai : On the video gaming side, I think, look, we are -- maybe today have a lot of momentum in these areas, both with YouTube as a platform, Google play. So, these are assets that really worked well, and we will continue investing there. Nothing new or interesting to share with you at this time. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any closing remarks. Ellen West : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ellen West : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's First Quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2017 filed with the SEC. Undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, and they are made based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Ellen. We delivered ongoing strong revenue growth, up 26% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency. The sustained outstanding performance in sites revenues, in particular, reflects the combined benefits of innovation and secular growth, with mobile search again leading the way. Robust growth in network revenues was again led by our programmatic business. Ongoing substantial growth in other revenues, namely cloud, hardware and Play, continues to highlight the growing contribution of our non-ads opportunities. Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. As we highlighted in our earnings press release, our results this quarter were affected by a new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. I'll highlight the impact on particular line items as I review the quarter. I will then conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions. Starting with the summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $31.1 billion were up 26% year-over-year. We realized the positive currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $1.3 billion or $1.1 billion after the impact of our hedging program. Turning to Alphabet's revenue by geography. You can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $14.1 billion, up 20% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $10.5 billion, up 29% year-over-year. In constant currency terms, EMEA grew 21%, reflecting strengthening of both the euro and the British pound. APAC revenues were $4.8 billion, up 33% versus last year and up 30% in constant currency, reflecting strengthening of the Japanese yen and Australian dollar. Other America revenues were $1.7 billion, up 36% year-over-year and up 35% in constant currency. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $13.5 billion, up 37% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.2 billion, up 39% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were, first, costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which was affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses primarily from G&A second, content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube; and finally, hardware related costs. Operating expenses were $10.7 billion, up 27% year-over-year, with the biggest increase in R&D expenses reflecting our continued investment in technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects advertising investments in cloud and hardware as well as the Assistant. G&A expense trends were affected this quarter by a number of factors, in particular, performance fees accrued in connection with the recognition of equity security gains, which were partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A, primarily the other cost of revenues and the benefit of the Uber litigation settlement. Stock-based compensation totaled $2.5 billion. The quarter-on-quarter step-up reflects the full year equity refresh grant to employees at the beginning of the quarter and the biannual grant to SVPs. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 85,050, up 4,940 people from last quarter, including just over 2,000 people who joined at the end of January when we closed our previously announced deal with HTC. As in prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were the additions from HTC followed by hiring and cloud for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $7 billion, up 7% versus last year, and the operating margin was 22%. Other income and expense was $3.5 billion, which includes $3 billion of primarily unrealized gains in equity security investments recognized under the new accounting standard. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 11% for the first quarter. As outlined in our earnings press release, this includes a 5 percentage point reduction from the release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which offset the income tax expense on the equity security gains. Net income was $9.4 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $13.33. As indicated in the table in our earnings press release, these results reflect an increase in net income of $2.4 billion and $3.40 in earnings per diluted share due to the impact from the gains in equity security investments we've already discussed. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $7.3 billion, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $11.6 billion with free cash flow of $4.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $103 billion. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $31 billion, up 26% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $22 billion in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year, led again by mobile search complemented by solid growth from desktop search and strong performance from YouTube. Network revenues were $4.6 billion, up 16% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $4.4 billion, up 36% year-over-year fueled by cloud, hardware and Play. As a reminder, the hardware revenues in this line now include our Nest business, and prior periods were restated. We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. As we previously announced, we made a change this quarter to impression-based monetization metrics for our network business given the ongoing growth of programmatic. Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.3 billion or 24% of total advertising revenues and up 36% year-over-year. This year-on-year increase in sites TAC, as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up year-over-year, reflecting primarily an increase in the sites TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC. The underlying trend affecting the network TAC rate year-over-year continues to be the shift to programmatic, which carries higher TAC. Google's stock-based compensation totaled $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Operating income was $8.4 billion, up 12% versus last year, and the operating margin was 27%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $7.7 billion, reflecting investments in facilities, production equipment and data center construction. Facilities was the largest component of CapEx of this quarter due primarily to the $2.4 billion purchase of Chelsea Market that we announced in March. Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. For the first quarter, Other Bets revenues were $150 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. As a reminder, Nest results are now reported as part of the Google segment, with revenues reflected in the Google other revenues line. Operating loss was $571 million for the first quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $55 million. We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates. At Waymo, we have achieved 5 million miles of driving on city streets, adding the latest million in just 3 months. We also announced a long-term partnership with Jaguar Land Rover for their fully electric I-PACE vehicles. Verily is seeing good progress with Onduo, its joint venture with Sanofi. The companies made its diabetes management platform commercially available in 3 states with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arkansas and South Carolina and Anthem's health plan in Georgia. Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. First, with respect to revenues. The opportunity set ahead of us is quite extraordinary, and we remain focused on investment to support long-term revenue and profit growth. We have both the business confidence to invest appropriately in the next phase of innovation as well as clarity about some very compelling opportunities that, in our judgment, will enable us to create shareholder value. We're pleased with the continued momentum of our revenue growth again this quarter, reflecting strong underlying trends across our business, which are amplified by our relentless focus on innovation, not only in our newer businesses, like cloud and hardware, but in our sites business. Specifically, we're excited by the still sizable opportunity in search advertising led by mobile. At 26% year-on-year revenue growth in our sites business, we continue to benefit from our investments to enhance the user and advertiser experience. Second, with respect to profitability. Within cost of revenues, the biggest component is TAC. While we expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenues, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, we continue to anticipate that the pace of year-over-year growth in sites TAC, as a percentage of sites revenues, will slow beginning in this second quarter. Within OpEx, as I said last quarter, we are continuing to support our priority investment areas. Within R&D, this is reflected in increased headcount, particularly for technical roles. Sales and marketing is similarly elevated to support these areas, both in the quarter and for the full year, and we expect expenses to remain more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year to support the holiday season. As you've seen in prior quarters, G&A can be a more difficult line to forecast. In particular, this quarter, we had the impact of the accrual for performance fees related to the equity gains previously discussed, partially offset by the reallocation of some expenses to other cost of revenues and the Uber legal settlement. We appreciate the importance of prioritization and are keenly focused on the steps we can take to make the right investments with the proper intensity while being diligent about long-term plans and returns. For our Other Bets, we remain focused on moving toward commercial applications in a number of areas with a continued focus on calibrating investment to metrics for success. Third, with respect to CapEx. Our commitment to growth is evident in the trend in CapEx investment, almost equally split this quarter between compute capacity and facilities. Our facilities spent in Google dominated by the Chelsea Market acquisition reflects that we favor owning rather than leasing real estate when we see good opportunities. With respect to compute capacity, the largest component of CapEx is for machines that incorporate the latest technologies. We are also investing in data center growth and increased network capacity through undersea cables. These combined investments will expand our compute capacity to support our growth outlook across Google, including machine learning, the Assistant and cloud. In many respects, these investments underscore my opening comment about both our confidence and clarity about future opportunities with our focus on proprietary solutions that enable us to deliver the secure, reliable, high-performing compute infrastructure to support new and emerging products and services for our users, advertisers and enterprise customers. I will now turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Ruth. The end of Q1 is always an exciting time as we prepare for our annual developer conference, Google I/O. Computing is evolving at a rapid rate, and we can't wait to share what's next and how we are tackling important issues. I want to call out an important highlight from Q1, the Google news initiative that we unveiled in March. Over the years, we have worked closely with the news industry to address key challenges through projects like Accelerated Mobile Pages. We are building on that partnership with the $300 million investment to elevate and strengthen quality journalism. As part of this effort, we announced more than a dozen new products, including Subscribe with Google developed in close collaboration with publishers, which lets you use your Google account to buy a subscription on participating news sites. We've had overwhelming interest. Since the launch, we have heard from more than 300 news publishers who are interested in Subscribe with Google. We also introduced new tools for journalists and improvements to our platforms to ensure that we are surfacing accurate quality content where it matters most. Today, I'll quickly talk about how machine learning is helping us advance that mission, then I'll highlight progress in our 3 big areas, cloud, YouTube and hardware, and share updates on our computing and advertising platforms. First, machine learning and making information accessible to everyone. Our own ML-powered products like Google Photos and Google Lens gets better every day. The Google Assistant is a great example of this. In the home, we have added over 200 new device partners that work with Assistant just on the last 4 months alone. We now partner with all major manufacturers of connected devices for the home in the U.S. All told, the Google Assistant can now help you with over 1 million actions, including new things like reminding you to buy bread when you get to the store or sending money to friends or if you want to get a ride share home. For a concept we unveiled at I/O less than 2 years ago, this is great progress. AI is also unlocking new opportunities for everyone. Just in the last few months, we have seen some amazing applications from dairy farmers in Georgia using TensorFlow to improve the health their herds to our own Google researchers who figured out how to use ML techniques to assess a person's risk of a heart attack. The possibilities of AI in health care are truly exciting. At our recent TensorFlow summit, we introduced TensorFlow hub, making it easier for developers to share and reuse models so that we can work together to tackle even more problems and get to better ideas faster. Our investments in this area are helped because of our specialized Tensor Processing Units, which are specifically designed to be highly efficient for machine learning applications. Of course, we continue to advance Google's core mission in other ways, too. We recently launched our Google Go app in 26 African countries. This app reduces the amount of data needed to display search results by 40%, and we continue to invest in ways to give people granular and easy controls over their information across all our products. Every single day, nearly 20 million people visit My Account, which gives them options to review their Google security, privacy and ad settings. Additionally, tools like security checkup and privacy checkup prompt people to keep their account secure and control their data settings. Now turning to our three big areas, cloud, YouTube and hardware. Last quarter, we shared some exciting metrics about the progress of Google Cloud, including that we passed $1 billion per quarter in 2017. In Q1, we saw increasing momentum. We are growing across the board and are also signing significantly larger, more strategic deals for cloud. Our security capabilities, the easy-to-use advanced data analytics and machine learning solutions and the secure and industry-leading collaboration platform, G Suite, are winning customers over. Google Cloud is growing well. Some examples of new technologies announced in the quarter include Cloud AutoML, which makes it easier for companies without machine learning expertise to build complex neural nets and more than 20 new security products. Our global infrastructure continues to expand to support demand. We commissioned 3 new subsea cables and announced new regions in Canada, Japan, Netherlands and Saudi Arabia, bringing our total of recently launched and upcoming regions to 20. G Suite has reached a point where it can serve all the needs of a large enterprise, and as a result, grow at a certain inflection point. The Suite is growing from strength to strength. We believe our secure environment is an important factor in driving enterprise customer wins. G Suite customers like Colgate-Palmolive Company tell us that no one offers a better combination of hardware, network and data security. In Q1, we also signed agreements with customers like Airbus and Thailand's Krung Thai Bank. As a result, G Suite revenue growth accelerated in Q1. Next, YouTube. The platform continues to grow as millions of creators build communities and find opportunity on YouTube. Over the last year, channels earnings 6 figures annually grew more than 40%. This quarter, Dua Lipa's video for New Rules became the 100th video on YouTube to reach 1 billion views. We are also investing in new experiences like life content, where we see tremendous momentum. One recent example was our exclusive Coachella live stream, which had more than 41 million live views from all over the world. Coachella was YouTube's most viewed live music festival ever. And no surprise, Beyonc\u00e9 was the most viewed Coachella performance ever on YouTube. Even as we invest in new experiences, we stay very focused on making sure that YouTube remains a safe platform with great content. We are aggressively combating content that violates our strict policies through a combination of user and machine flags. Over 6 million videos removed in Q4 were first flagged by our machine systems, and over 75% of those videos were removed before receiving a single view. We also changed our monetization requirements to better identify creators who contribute positively to the community and drive more ad revenue to them. Moving to hardware. This quarter, we welcome Nest of the Google hardware team to supercharge our efforts. Nest is building industry-leading products for the home, including new additions like the Nest Hello doorbell and Nest temperature sensor. In 2017, they sold more devices than the previous 2 years combined. They are an incredibly talented team with fantastic momentum. Google Home continues to be super popular, and we are making it available in many more countries. Just recently, we launched Google Home in many -- in India and Singapore, and the response has been terrific. Our early 2018 Net Promoter Scores rank among the highest in the industry across all product categories. This shows how much love people have for Made by Google consumer hardware devices and makes us even more excited for what's ahead. There's great momentum across our computing platforms, like Android and Chrome. At Mobile World Congress, a new generation of Android partner devices was introduced, including Android One phones like the Nokia 7 plus. Android One pairs high-quality hardware with a secured and streamlined software and experience from Google. This quarter, we launched the Acer Chromebook Tab 10, the first Chrome OS tablet designed specifically for education. It is a secure and easily shareable tablet equipped with all the Chromebook features that educators and students love. And finally, our advertising platforms. We continue to make Google Search and Shopping the best places for people to find and buy products from a range of merchants. We recently announced shopping actions, allowing customers to easily buy from their choice of participating retailers on the Google Assistant and Search with the universal card across mobile, desktop and even Google Home. The results are really helping retailers. Early testing showed that participating retailers see an average increase in basket size of about 30%. YouTube is delivering great results for our advertisers. To help brands reach broad audiences on YouTube with even more flexibility, we introduced TrueView for Reach, which optimizes in stream ads to reach a wide audience. In beta testing, 9 out of 10 campaigns drove a significant lift in ad recall, with an average lift of nearly 20%. We are also helping small businesses take advantage of video with the expansion of YouTube Director onsite to over 170 U.S. cities. This gives SMBs access to a professional filmmaker to create and edit their video ads. Finally, we remain focused on investing in our publisher partners. Last year, we paid $12.6 billion to publishing partners in our ad network. We recently announced AdSense Auto ads. This uses machine learning to analyze ad placements on a publisher's page and show ads when they are likely to perform well while providing a good user experience. Google's success depends not just on the success of our partners but also on the community's very work. We recently announced the Rolling Study Halls program for rural areas across 12 states. It equips school buses with Wi-Fi devices and onboard educators so that students with long commutes can get their homework done during the trip. We are also making long-term investments in our offices and data centers around the country. Last month, we announced the purchase of Manhattan's Chelsea Market building. And in Tennessee and Alabama, we broke ground on 2 new data centers, which will have a big economic impact on the local economies. These investments are made hand-in-hand with our commitment to sustainability. In 2017, we officially met our goal to purchase enough renewable energy to match all electricity consumed by our operations around the world. I want to close by saying thank you to our employees. It's been a particularly tough few weeks for the Google family, especially at YouTube. I'm so proud of the resilience that our employees have shown, and I'm so grateful for the support we have gotten across the industry and from the community. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : Ruth, just first on the accounting change, I was just hoping you could clarify. If we're trying to normalize that, is it right that we would be adding back about $632 million to operating income and then reducing EPS by $3.40, and then just on the EPS side, perhaps adjusting for the tax rate? And then just in terms of the business, I just wanted to ask about Waymo. If you could talk a little bit about just the latest timing for the commercial launch in Phoenix and how quickly you'd look to expand to other markets, and then just how you're thinking about the technology and whether you'll license it to others going forward or keep it more proprietary for Waymo services? Ruth Porat : Sure. So on the accounting standard, we try to lay out all the component parts clearly on the cover of the earnings release so that you would have it all in one place. I think you summarized it right, but I'll just direct everybody to the earnings release. The net of which was the gain from the equity investments was $2.4 billion to net income. That is net of performance fees as well as the release of a deferred tax asset that we have, so it does reflect $3 billion in gains. And I think you know this, but this quarter, the accounting standard requires marks for everything where there is an observable raise. So these are unrealized -- the majority of them are unrealized, not actually monetized by Alphabet, and then the performance fees are calculated based on investment returns. They're accrued but not paid until an exit event occurs, and they do appear in OpEx. And as you noted, there is also, therefore, the benefit that flows through on the tax line, and that is 5 percentage points of benefit offset to the effective tax rate for the quarter. As it relates to your Waymo question, there was a lot in there. We do remain very excited about the opportunity with Waymo and our continued progress on multiple fronts. It is still very early. In terms of our progress, this year is about offering a service that is safe, that works, that delight users in the Phoenix area. The rider program in Phoenix is open to members of the public, and riders will use a Waymo app to hail one of our fully self-driving cars without a driver at the wheel, and will pay for the service. We've also had progress on the vehicle partnerships, as I mentioned in my opening comments. Last month, Waymo announced it signed a long-term strategic partnership with Jaguar beginning with a collaboration to design and manufacture self-driving I-PACE vehicles for Waymo's transportation service. These are all electric cars. This new partnership in the vehicles adds to our strong position with FCA, and the production of the cars begins in 2020. And then we are expanding our testing to more states. We're also working on additional areas like applying the technology to logistics and deliveries and working with cities to help strengthen public transportation and for personal use vehicles. And as we've talked about on a bunch of calls, the opportunity is here for us because we started with safety, and we remain a leader in safety, and we do believe that's the foundation for success, and it builds on the -- all the testing miles that we've done. So we keep coming back to when you create vehicles that drive themselves faithfully, we think there's a lot of potential uses and business opportunities, and that's what we're focused on. Operator : And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : I wanted to ask two quick questions. One, just one on GDPR then one on cloud. On GDPR, just wondering if you could share with us kind of any impact you're thinking about as the implementation occurs later in May, and so any thoughts you could share there would be great. And then on cloud, Sundar, you had mentioned you're seeing a lot of momentum. You said G Suite, I believe, accelerated in Q1. I was wondering if there was any color on the GCP side that you could share from a growth perspective if that business accelerated or not and kind of how were the deal sites trending for that business in particular. Sundar Pichai : Great. Maybe I'll do the GDPR first. GDPR, I realize, is a fairly new public OPEC. But for us, it's not new. We started working on GDPR compliance over 18 months ago and have been very, very engaged on it. It's really important, and we care about getting it right. And overall, we have long had a very robust and strong privacy program at Google, too. So we are committed to meeting requirements on May 25 and also long term. We are working very closely with advertisers, publishers and our partners. And we will also update all the privacy policies and controls we provide to users worldwide. So it's a big effort. We are very committed to it. We are very focused on getting it right by our users and partners, and that's where our focus is now. On -- Heather, on cloud, I guess your question was about overall growth, and we are continuing -- the momentum has been very strong on cloud as well. We haven't talked about G Suite much, and so we highlighted it the moment I'm there, but cloud is continuing its great growth. We are seeing it across the board. Things worth I would call out is we are seeing larger deals as well. We are seeing good synergies between G Suite and cloud. Areas where we have done acquisitions like Apigee, they are beginning to work in terms of driving synergies to cloud. And the efforts we are beginning to put particular with our partners, that is beginning to bear fruit as well. So we have go-to-market programs now with SAP, Cisco and Salesforce. And I think we are beginning to see early results from that, and hopefully, that translates into more momentum going forward. Operator : And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Eric Sheridan : Maybe two for Sundar, if I can. One, on mobile search, continue to call that out as a point of strength in the results. What are you most excited about in terms of either the product innovation or the ability to get consumers to adopt mobile search more broadly on devices globally, which could lead to more ad budgets moving it to mobile search? And then on hardware, you've now been through 2 years of sort of Pixel devices. You've made the aqui-hire of ETC engineers. Can you give us a sense of what you've learned so far from your hardware efforts and how that might evolve product innovation or go-to-market strategies long term? Sundar Pichai : On mobile search, for me, mobile obviously raises the bar. And if you look at the evolution of Search, we gave from -- we evolved to stay ahead of user expectations, and we evolved from just providing links to answers. I just feel at a high level the next big evolution we are doing as part of mobile search and assistant is to actually help users complete actions, to help get things done. And it's really hard to do at scale, and that's the work we are doing. And as we do that, it'll impact just -- not just the Assistant but mobile search more broadly. And obviously, that has a commercial impact as well. So we continue to be very excited about the opportunities there. On hardware, the exciting part for us is now, I think we have all the end-to-end capabilities of a world-class hardware organization, along with the quality of the software organizations we have always had. And in this area, it truly takes long-term planning. And so for example, if you think about silicon, et cetera, the longer you can do it, the more advantages you have. And so I definitely feel we are taking the steps towards being able to do this well for the long term. Part of that obviously involves scaling of our go-to-market strategies both in the U.S. and internationally so that we can drive adoption. I said earlier, our Net Promoter Scores show that we are right up there with the best-in-class devices and across all the products we have, not just our Pixel, across our Nest family and everything we do. So the opportunity is clearly there. We're going to lean into it, and it takes two to three years to really get to the scale where we want to see it and -- but we are committed to getting there. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney : I want to follow up on Heather's question on GDPR, and the question I want to ask is, I understand that you're -- been working for a long time to make sure that you're compliant. But do you think that GDPR or other regulation that you see on the horizon is likely to impact materially the targeting capabilities about that advertisers have on Google? Is there something in the regulation that's going to make Google and its properties less attractive to advertisers? That's the action question I want to ask. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Mark. Above everything else, as we are working through GDPR, we are making sure we are focused on getting the user experience right for our users and our partners. But to clarify your question further, first of all, it's important to understand that most of our ad business is Search, where we rely on very limited information, essentially what is in the keywords to show a relevant ad or product. And so we've been preparing this for 18 months, and I think we are focused on getting the compliance right. It'll be a year's long effort, and we are helping not just us but our publishers and partners. But overall, we think we'll be able to do all that with the positive impact for users and publishers and the advertisers and so our business. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have two. The first one on desktop search. So it's nice to hear that your oldest business is still growing. Just curious, could you give 1 or 2 tangible examples or products that are still driving the desktop search growth? And Sundar, I understand you're always focused on user experience. At a high level, what do you see is the biggest areas potential further improvement in desktop search? And let me ask you the same question about YouTube. What are sort of the biggest areas of tension that you're focused on improving from a user perspective on YouTube right now? Sundar Pichai : So on desktop search -- sorry, is your question on the user experience on desktop search, how do we see improvements? Look, I mean, the same. First of all, users are having cross-device experiences, cross-screen experiences, right? So I think your desktop search experience, mobile search, everything goes hand-in-hand. And every -- all the work we are doing to make mobile search better translates to desktop search as well. Areas where desktop search historically has been a bit behind is in terms of things like identity and payments and having all that work well to enhance the user experience. And with Chrome now, we are investing a lot in those areas as well, and I think that will contribute overall to improvements there. On YouTube, there are many, many areas we are focused on YouTube. They're always very focused on making sure they are supporting emerging formats, be it mobile live streaming or emerging formats like VR, and so that's an area of focus for us. We are also really looking at what are all-new monetization options for creators beyond advertising. So be it subscriptions, features like super chat, which we have launched, are very popular. We have beta testing sponsorships, merchandise, merchandising and concept, ticketing and et cetera, right? So these are all areas by which we are improving. And obviously, there are additional areas like Music and YouTube TV, which are seeing great momentum as well. Operator : And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Ross Sandler : Just two questions, please. Americas revenue accelerated nicely on a currency neutral basis. It's a geography that rarely comes up on your calls. So any color about what's driving that acceleration and the sustainability of what's going on in the Americas region? And then, Ruth, a question on sites TAC. So I know you said the pace of deleverage is going to start to improve next quarter. Is this something that we should expect to happen for a year and then kind of normalize back to pretty steady pace of deleverage? Or is this -- are we over some critical threshold, and we should see this trend of moderating deleverage continue for several years into the future? Ruth Porat : So on your first question, other Americas. I would say, like the other regions, really pleased with the strength we have. Across the regions, it is obviously one of the smaller ones, so growing at a slightly faster clip and really pleased with the broad strength there. It starts with the sites revenue strength. But on top of that, they benefited from hardware devices launching in some additional markets over the past year. And then in terms of TAC, I would say there's not much to add to what we've already said after some -- a kind of sustained period of stronger increases. We were pleased last quarter to be able to signal that this quarter that pace of change is slowing, and just leave it at that for now. Operator : And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore. Anthony DiClemente : I have two, one for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, on CapEx, even if we exclude the Chelsea Market one-timer, the gross in CapEx, is it really substantial even on a kind of recurring basis. Should we expect that sort of dramatic growth or step-up in the growth of rate in ongoing CapEx to continue throughout the year? Or other than the Chelsea Market one-timer, were there any -- do we have any reason to think that it was timing in terms of the timing, front-end weighted, it's the first quarter for CapEx? And then secondly on -- Sundar, just a question on YouTube and your media strategy at a higher level. In view of the success of other competitive subscription TV products out there, Internet video products, can you just talk about YouTube Red and any thoughts on ways you can accelerate growth for your YouTube subscription video products, whether that may be organic investment and content original production or even via acquisition? Ruth Porat : So in terms of CapEx, it's about equally split between facilities and our technical infrastructure. And as you know that we have the $2.4 billion purchase in New York as well as discontinued ground-up development projects. Facilities does tend to be lumpier over time. We are continuing with the ground-up development projects. And as a reminder, we do favor owning rather than leasing real estate when we see good opportunities, and that has served us well over the years. But I think more to your question with respect to technical infrastructure, that reflects investments in compute power to support growth that we see across Google, and the largest component is on machines. It's also on data centers and undersea cables. And on machines, the biggest contributor is the demand that we're seeing. So in particular, it's the expanding application of the machine learning efforts across Alphabet, plus the requirements for cloud and Search and YouTube, and then secondarily, the increased cost of newer technologies, CPUs, memory, network. So I think, really, to answer your question most directly, it reflects the demand that we're seeing, so I wouldn't want to suggest a one-off in terms of the investments we're making in technical infrastructure. And then in terms of the data centers, we are investing globally. We currently have over 20 sites on 4 continents, and that's under different stages of construction, as Sundar noted. And it's across the U.S. Tennessee, Alabama, South Carolina, Iowa. So we're really building out to support the growth that we're seeing. Sundar Pichai : Sorry, on the second question on YouTube, for sure, the adoption and feedback across both YouTube Red and YouTube Music has been great to see. We are doing a lot more work there. You will see us continue to invest further and develop those offerings better, and as part of that, further drive adoption. So for example, YouTube Originals end up playing a big part in YouTube Red subscriptions. And so far, we have launched in a handful of markets, and we'll continue to roll it out to more markets there. And on YouTube Music, we are working on enhancing the product, and I think this definitely create opportunities there as well. Operator : And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Daniel Salmon : Sundar, I had two for you. First, during the quarter, where there were some reports of changes in leadership that your Search and AI divisions functionally sounds like separating leadership over those 2 very large, important businesses for the company. Could you talk a little bit more about that and how that may impact broader strategy for the company? And then second, a little bit more technical one on your advertising business you launched, shopping actions during the quarter with a pay-per-sale model, pricing model. And I was just curious to hear what type of feedback you were getting from advertisers that led to a product with that pricing model in particular, any other features of shopping actions that you think are important to highlight. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Dan. Search has been leading the company in terms of how they have been adopting machine learning and AI, and it's really working well through Search and Assistant. We sense that, obviously, as an AI-first company, AI cuts across everything we do in Google. And so as an organization, it's a horizontal organization, which needs to serve all our areas and in some ways, the change reflects that. And we have very capable leaders. Jeff, who runs -- was the Founder of Google Brain and really well positioned to lead our AI efforts. And Ben has been at Google since the early days of Search, started in Google in 2000 and has been driving Search for over 18 years. And so we are very excited, and we think the changes will serve the company well. On your second thing, the question was on shopping actions? Daniel Salmon : And in particular, the price per sale pricing model. Sundar Pichai : So I think we announced the -- this new service in March, and the feedback has been very positive. I mentioned earlier, which is for retailers, when they are testing this, they see it drives an increase in basket size. So that means users are interacting with the product well, and that's all I have to share for now. It's still early days. Operator : And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Colin Sebastian : A couple for me, please. First, on the cloud business. I was wondering if you could provide any color, at least in the relative momentum you're seeing in that segment from infrastructure services compared to platform or software services. And then related to the adoption of AMP. I guess, a key question we get asked is whether that ultimately changes usage, and maybe you have some perspective on this from Android. But in the ecosystem between mobile web pages and app usage, if you're seeing any shift among users between those formats. Sundar Pichai : On the first question of cloud, look, I mean, I think the main thing I would say is the fundamental drivers of adoption of Google Cloud based on what we hear back from customers is our advantage in data analytics and machine learning. The fact that we really support open, agile development environment. Kubernetes has literally become the standard for workloads and the fact that we are open in terms of how we approach this space. Security is becoming a big differentiator for us and something we've been leading for a while, and I think that's driving it. G Suite, as I called out earlier, is a good synergistic driver. G Suite is doing well, and clearly, a very unique offering, and it's gotten very comprehensive. And so I think overall, it comes together well. On your second question around AMP, AMP has been definitely very successful. It's really made publisher content much more friendly for users in terms of latency and the user experience, and hence, that option has been great. For sure, AMP has definitely helped the mobile web, and that's part of the big reasons we did it. Mobile web is still a big part of how users consume content, especially around news, and so us investing there clearly makes a difference. I guess, for example, when we look at, I don't know, J.Crew adopted AMP, their mobile page loading times are now over 90% faster. And now they are integrating the Google payment request API. That reduces checkout times from 2 minutes to 30 seconds or so. So things like that. We are going to constantly stay on improving the mobile web, and that plays a big part in how our ecosystem works. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Michael Nathanson : I have two, one for Sundar, one for Ruth. First, Sundar, can you give us any sense of how Google Home consumers are using Search in these devices differently than maybe the traditional ways of Search? And you're finding in those homes, is it additive to overall search activity? And then for Ruth, if you look at the last page of press release, where you've shown the new monetization metrics, you see a real increase in the cost per impression on network sites. So can you talk about maybe what's happening there? Is there a mix shift types of publishers, types of products? Or is that just market inflation? Sundar Pichai : Look, for sure, Google Home gives rise to a lot of new and unique use cases, actions that are a big part of it. Call mom is a good example of something you say to Google Home a lot. I can -- which is different than what you would say to Search. We see this as a good complementary thing. You will see Search embrace some of the capabilities you find in Google Assistant and Google Home and vice versa. And so overall, I view this as additive in the long term, and we are definitely just getting started there. Ruth Porat : And then on the network monetization trends. First, just to give people a bit more color. When we launched the AdSense businesses, our network revenues were largely click-based. And over time, there's been a meaningful mix change in our business given the strong growth in programmatic, which is impression-based. So as a result, the shift now covers more of the business. And then in terms of the question on impression growth versus CPM growth, as we've discussed on prior calls, the network business is actually a number of different businesses. And then within that, we have flat year-on-year growth in the number of impressions that was driven by efforts to improve user experience through a reduction of less relevant ads and AFC. And so these changes had a positive impact on the year-on-year growth in CPMs. And then the trend and impressions in CPMs can clearly be volatile from quarter-to-quarter as we're optimizing for the user publisher and advertiser, but it really goes to the efforts that we make. Operator : And our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Brent Thill : Just as a question regarding any changes on your framework for growth versus operating margins. The last few quarters, you've seen steady top line acceleration, yet the margins were down. Can you just talk about how you think about it at a high level for this year? Any changes from the past? Ruth Porat : Yes, it's an important question. As we've talked about on many, many calls, we have been and remain focused on supporting long-term revenue and profit growth, and we think the opportunity set ahead of us is quite extraordinary. And as I said in opening comments, just given our confidence and as we're looking forward, we want to make sure we're investing appropriately in the next phase of innovation, and we have clarity about some very compelling opportunities. And then our judgment, that enables us to maximize shareholder value. So we're taking the steps really to put in place the support for long-term -- longer-term growth. Part of what I'm saying, you can see in our sites revenue growth, try to make that clear in opening comments, we see this consistent, strong momentum globally, and we're really excited about the still sizable opportunity led by mobile search. And so we're continuing to invest to enhance the user and advertiser experience, and thereby, extend the growth in our ads business. You can see this also in the trend on the CapEx spend. As I noted in our opening comments, the investments we're making there really provide the compute capacity to support our growth outlook, and that's supporting the opportunities that come out of machine learning and the Assistant. And then we also see extraordinary upside in the newer markets, as Sundar has talked about, most notably cloud computing and hardware. And so we're investing to support the long-term growth opportunity there. And then finally, when we look at the market opportunity in both self-driving cars and life sciences, our judgment is it makes sense to place the kinds of investments that we are. And with all of this, what also hasn't changed is we appreciate the importance of prioritization and picking our spots, and we're keenly focused on steps we can take to both make the right investments with the proper intensity while being diligent about long-term plans and returns. So at a high level, the approach hasn't changed. You're seeing the investments here. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Stephen Ju : So Sundar, I think one of the themes that you as a management team has talked about has been to, I guess, democratize advertising with AI to help SMBs who may have found advertising across Google's ad products to be perhaps overwhelming. So can you talk about the rate of uptake among the smaller advertisers and whether or not this is helping to catalyze growth in new budgets and where these guys might otherwise have not been able to advertise before? There's SMBs and then there's local also. So what will be the plan to get this technology into the hands of folks who will want to use them? Sundar Pichai : Look, I mean, there's a big focus for us. And today, SMBs are -- play a big role in our ecosystem, and we are doing a lot of stuff to support them across the board, right, and from things like in our offerings to help SMBs get an online presence, create a website, be discovered in local, search and Google Maps. So we do a lot of detailed work to make sure SMBs are working well. We are also doing a lot of stuff on local as well, including efforts that are even around local services. So we have very specific initiatives. This is going to be -- I mean, it's actually -- to us, it's bread and butter of what we do here, and so there's a lot of effort underway, not to mention the fact that we provide G Suite for businesses as they scale up as well. So it's an end-to-end offering, and we'll -- you'll continue to see us invest more here. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any closing remarks. Ellen West : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to turn the conference call over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ellen West : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now, I\u2019ll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2017 filed with the SEC. Undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, and they are made based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Ellen. We delivered another quarter with strong operating performance, reflecting our focus on building great experiences for users, advertisers and enterprise customers around the world. In aggregate, we had substantial revenue growth, up 26% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency. Sites revenues continued to exhibit strong year-on-year momentum, benefiting from innovation and secular growth with mobile search again leading the way. Our network adverting business maintained a healthy growth, led by AdMob and programmatic advertising. The businesses comprising other revenues, namely Cloud, Play and Hardware again had substantial growth. Our outline for today\u2019s call is I\u2019ll begin with results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. There are two items to note in our earnings press release. First, we provided a table to highlight the impact of the European Commission fines on operating income, net income and EPS results in the second quarters of 2018 and 2017. Second, as discussed last quarter, our results are affected by the new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. This new standard continues to result in greater volatility in OI&E. I\u2019ll highlight the impact on particular line items, as I review the quarter. I will then review results for Google followed by Other Bets and will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions. Starting with the summary of Alphabet\u2019s consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $32.7 billion were up 26% year-over-year. We realized the positive currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $768 million or $665 million after the impact of our hedging program. Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography. You can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $14.9 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $10.8 billion, up 26% year-over-year. In constant currency terms, EMEA grew 19%, reflecting strengthening of both the euro and for British pound. APAC revenues were $5.1 billion, up 36% versus last year and up 34% in constant currency, reflecting strengthening of the Japanese yen and Korean won. Other Americas revenues were $1.8 billion, up 31% year-over-year and up 34% in constant currency, reflecting strengthening of the dollar relative to the Brazilian real. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I\u2019ll discuss in the Google segment results, was $13.9 billion, up 34% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.5 billion, up 41% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which continued to be affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, followed by hardware-related costs. Operating expenses, including the impact of the EC fine, were $16 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fines, operating expenses were $10.9 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year. Once again, the biggest increase was in R&D expenses, reflecting our continued investment in technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects increases in sales and marketing headcount, primarily for Cloud, followed by advertising investments in Cloud and the Assistant. G&A expense trends in the second quarter were affected by a number of factors, in particular, performance fees accrued in connection with the recognition of equity security gains, which were again partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A, primarily the other cost of revenues. Stock-based compensation totaled $2.4 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 89,058, up 4,008 from last quarter. As in prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were in Cloud for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $2.8 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fines, operating income was $7.9 billion, up 15% versus last year, for an operating margin of 24%. Other income and expense was $1.4 billion, which includes $1.1 billion of gains in equity security investments. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 24.2% for the second quarter, reflecting a sizable impact from the non-deductibility of the EC fine. Net income was $3.2 billion and earnings per diluted share were $4.54. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, net income was $8.3 billion and earnings per diluted share were $11.75. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $5.5 billion, which I\u2019ll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $10.1 billion with free cash flow of $4.7 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $102 billion. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $32.5 billion, up 25% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail. Google Sites revenues were $23.3 billion in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search with strong contributions from both YouTube and desktop search. Network revenues were $4.8 billion, up 14% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and programmatic. Other revenues for Google were $4.4 billion, up 37% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud, Play and Hardware. We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.4 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 26% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year-over-year, primarily reflecting an increase in the sites TAC rate, which was offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC. This quarter, we experienced year-on-year decline in the network TAC rate as a result of the favorable mix shift within our problematic business. Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 21% year-over-year. Operating income was $9 billion, up 17% versus last year and the operating margins was 27.6%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.3 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction, and facilities. Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. Other Bets revenues were $145 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $732 million for the second quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $10 million. We\u2019re pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates. Waymo expanded its partnership with Fiat Chrysler with the option to add up to 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans to its self-driving fleet. And lastly Waymo announced that it has driven more than 8 million fully autonomous miles with most of those on city streets. A couple of weeks ago, X announced that Loon and Wing have graduated to become independent companies under Alphabet. Graduation from X signals that these companies have reached certain technical and business milestones and that their focus is shifting toward commercialization. And just last week, Loon indicated that it is partnering with Telkom Kenya to launch commercial service in regions of Kenya by early 2019. Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer term outlook. First, with respect to revenues. We\u2019re pleased with the ongoing momentum in our advertising businesses. As discussed previously, we continue to identify new opportunities through innovation, including the benefits of applying machine learning to create more useful experiences for users and advertisers. Looking ahead, our hardware business is seasonal, typically experiencing lower growth in the third quarter in anticipation of the launch of new products for the holiday season. Second, with respect to profitability. Within cost of revenues, the biggest component is TAC. As we\u2019ve discussed for the past couple of quarters, we expected the pace of year-on-year growth in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue would slow after the first quarter of 2018, and you can see that clearly in our results of this quarter. As frequently discussed, we do expect the sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, albeit at a more moderate pace relative to the year-on-year increases experienced over the past several quarters. Within OpEx, we continue to take a disciplined approach to setting priorities as we invest for the long-term growth. The majority of our headcount growth continues to be in technical roles and engineering and product management. In terms of business areas, the largest number of headcount additions were in our cloud business with hires for engineering, sales and marketing. As a reminder, headcount additions tend to be seasonally higher in Q3 because that is when we bring our new graduates. As I mentioned last quarter, regarding sales and marketing, we continue to expect expenses to be more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year to support the holiday season. Another factor to consider in year-on-year comparisons next quarter is the timing of two expense items in Q3 last year. As we called out last year, there was a meaningful benefit in the third quarter of 2017 from the shift in timing of our annual equity refresh and also from the timing of sales and marketing spend which was more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. For our Other Bets, we remain focused on making progress on a number of commercial opportunities across the business, while continuing to manage investment against achievement of key milestones. Third, with respect to CapEx. As I discussed with you last quarter, our commitment to growth is evident in the ongoing trend in CapEx investment. We\u2019ve been investing meaningfully in search and ads consistent with the opportunities we see to benefit the user and advertiser experience. And we are investing in the additional compute power required to support growth in the number of YouTube users globally. We\u2019re also investing in new businesses that are growing at a rapid pace and have sizable compute needs, most notably Cloud. The investment pace also reflects the importance of machine learning across all of our products including search and ads. Although machine learning is more compute-intensive, it is increasingly core to businesses across Alphabet, and opens up the possibility of accelerated innovation in products and services. And keeping with our approach across Alphabet to invest thoughtfully for long-term value creation, we remain focused on both performance and cost effectiveness. I will now turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thanks Ruth. It\u2019s been a busy few months at Google, and we showed a lot of what we are working on at events like Google Marketing Live, Brandcast, and of course our annual developer conference, Google I/O. It was exciting to have millions of people join us in person and via live stream. Tomorrow, I hope you\u2019ll tune in to Google Cloud Next where the great momentum and innovation in our cloud business will be fully on display. The common thread you\u2019ll hear on today\u2019s call is the benefit of machine learning and AI, and how it\u2019s improving our products and generating great results for our users and partners. I also hope that everyone enjoyed the World Cup as much as I did. I know our French Googlers were very excited. I loved the competition and was extremely proud to see positive feedback about how useful Google Translate was for people who traveled to Russia. The app translates about 143 billion words a day. And during the World Cup, we saw a huge bump in volume. In the simple moments when you\u2019re in an unfamiliar place or you don\u2019t know the language, Google is there to help with the right information at the right time. This is what we aspire to best at, and it\u2019s why billions of people continue to put their trust in our products. Today, I\u2019ll start with how AI is enabling us to advance the mission of making information accessible and useful to everyone in new ways. Then, I\u2019ll share updates on our computing, video and advertising platforms which are helping our partners succeed and grow. And finally, I\u2019ll talk about our growing cloud business. Let\u2019s begin with AI helping our mission. We revamped the Google News app in May to create reviews. It uses machine learning to highlight top stories organized for users, explore topics more deeply with articles from a range of clustered news sources. We believe in the need to deliver high-quality information and news to users, and to support the news industry as we do so. The Google Assistant is another the great product based on machine learning. By the end of this year, it will be available in more than 30 languages and 80 countries. We have worked with partners to expand the number of smart devices that are now compatible with the Google Assistant like doorbells, dryers, refrigerators and more, and connect with more than 5,000 devices in the home. At Google I/O, we also highlighted how AI is improving Google Maps, including enhancing the experience with Assistant and AR features. Through our improvements in machine learning, we have seen a 25x increase in our ability to build maps algorithmically, and we have added 110 million algorithmically drawn buildings to Maps, since the beginning of this year. And with over 1 billion users, we\u2019re continuing to see tremendous growth in maps with especially strong growth in countries like Indonesia, India and Nigeria, each of which are growing over 50% year-on-year. There are many more great AI powered features we rolled out this quarter including the new version of Gmail with Smart Compose, a new features that helps users craft emails faster. And Google Photos now suggests actions to help you brighten, share, rotate or archive a picture. Next, our computing, video and advertising platforms. These platforms are providing real economic opportunities for developers, creators and publishers in every corner of the vault. Last year, I announced that in the three-year period from 2014 to 2016, we paid out over $15 billion in revenue to our creator, publisher and app developer partners in Europe, Middle East and Africa via AdSense, YouTube and Google Play. Our contribution is accelerating. In 2017 alone, we generated an additional $7 billion for these partners. First, our computing platforms. 10 years ago, we launched the first Android phone with a simple idea to build a mobile platform that\u2019s free and open to everyone. Today, there are more than 24,000 devices at every price point from more than 1,300 different brands. The Android ecosystem supports thousands of phone makers and mobile network operators who build and sell Android devices. Millions of app developers around the world who have built their businesses of Android and billions of consumers who can now afford and use cutting-edge Android smartphones. This is all supported by a business model that encourages and enables this open ecosystem to thrive. Continuing this momentum, at I/O, we unveiled a plethora of new features throughout the Android platform, like battery saving features in Android P, new Google Assistant capabilities on Wear OS, the new Android model to help developers optimize for a variety of devices and form factors, as well as tools to help users understand and control how they are spending time on their device. Our investments in our computing platforms, as well as in AI and design are also helping us generate great momentum in our made by Google hardware business across Pixel, Home, Nest, Chromecast and more. We brought Google Home and Mini to Ireland, Australia, Spain and Mexico. Additionally, bringing the Nest and Google teams together is showing early results. The products can more seamlessly work together and our product development and go-to-market are benefiting from the new alignment. There is a lot more to come here in the next few months. Second, our video platform, YouTube is growing tremendously. We launched our revamped YouTube Music service across 17 countries, and it\u2019s receiving great feedback from users and artists a lot. This quarter, YouTube rebranded its subscription service, YouTube Premium, featuring originals like our hit series Cobra Kai, which got 41 million views to first episode alone. While advertising on YouTube is an incredibly strong and growing source of income for creators, we are also investing in new ways for creators to generate revenue on the platform, including paid channel memberships, merchandise shelves on YouTube channels, and endorsement opportunities, through a company we acquired in 2016, FameBit. In fact, half of the creators that used FameBit in the first three months of 2018, doubled their YouTube revenue. And third, our advertising platforms which are firing on all cylinders, as we put the power of machine learning into marketers\u2019 hands. At Google Marketing Live, we introduced our newly rebranded advertising products, our core product Google Ads, Google Marketing Platform which provides analytics and ad serving for large marketers and agencies, and Google Ad Manager, our monetization engine for publishers. We also announced a new ad format powered by machine learning, called Responsive Search Ads. It automates the manual process of building text ads and optimizes them in real time to show the best performing ad for each search query. Advertisers also got a first look at local campaigns and smart campaigns. Local campaigns are designed exclusively to drive foot traffic to local businesses and smart campaigns are now the default for new SMB advertisers. Small business owners love the simplicity and the results. This quarter, we announced shopping and commerce partnerships with leading global retailers like Carrefour, designed to give people the power to shop wherever and however they want. Carrefour is a great example of how we can partner deeply with companies, bringing our shopping and ads and cloud products together for them. They recently chose to migrate from Office to G Suite for their more than 160,000 employees and have selected us as their main cloud provider, based on our ability to support the Company\u2019s digital transformation. Speaking of our efforts to help businesses succeed in the cloud, our cloud business has great momentum. It\u2019s a natural extension of our long time strength in computing, data centers and machine learning. We have developed these over many years and they power our own services in the cloud and are now helping others. This week\u2019s Google Cloud Next event will have more than 20,000 SMBs, up from over 2,000 at our Cloud Conference in 2016 with over 250 customers speaking. I won\u2019t spoil any of the surprises, but I do want to call out Google Cloud\u2019s momentum. Success of our vertical strategy and customer centric approach was illustrated by key wins including Domino\u2019s Pizza, SoundCloud and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Target is migrating three areas of its business to Google Cloud platform. Financial institutions are increasingly turning to the cloud to modernize their systems, explore new business models and improve customer experiences. New customers include Banco Ita\u00fa in Brazil. We also have our rapidly growing business for our specialized cloud AI services. AirAsia expanded its relationship with us to use machine learning and data analytics. We are seeing an acceleration in business adoption of Chromebooks, the most secure and cost efficient way for businesses to enable their employees to work in the cloud. In Q2, unit sales of managed Chromebooks grew by more than 175% year-over-year. And we saw deployments at customers like Veolia. And to support our growing global customer base, we continue to invest in new cables, open new regions in Finland and Los Angeles, and announced the Zurich region. We now have 17 open regions with three more on the way. Before I close, I want to give a quick shout out to the work that we are doing to build great specialized products for the next wave of people coming online for the first time in countries like India, Indonesia, Brazil and Nigeria, many of whom experience the web only through their mobile phone. This is a big area of focus for us. Through a great partnership with Indian Railways, and RailTel, we have hit our goal of enabling high-speed public Wi-Fi in 400 train stations across India. We\u2019ve also rolled out this Google Station model in Indonesia and Mexico with more to come soon. And to help spur AI innovation in Africa, we recently announced the new Google AI research center in Ghana with the goal of bringing together top machine learning researchers and engineers to explore AI research and applications in Africa and beyond. Of course, our commitment to help communities and people benefit from the digital economy, expense beyond the products that they use. Last month, as part of our broader growth Google effort, we expanded the Google IT Support Professional Certificate program to more than 25 community colleges in the U.S. This will give students an opportunity to learn skills needed to jump start their carriers in IT support. I want to thank Googlers for their hard work which helps us create products that billions of people love and use every day. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan : Thank you very much. Two questions if I can. Sundar, for you, following upon your comments, we\u2019ve seen all of these partnerships announced in the commerce space. I want to understand how those partnerships might evolve over the next couple of years? What Google brings on table for those partners, what it might do for the advertising services business as we thing long-term? And then, we\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions on Waymo, in the quarter. Is there any you can give us of some of the key investment milestones or how we should be thinking about capital allocated to the Waymo business in the coming years? Thanks so much. Sundar Pichai : Great. On the commerce front, obviously, it\u2019s a natural sector I think for us to drive partnerships. We already have deep advertising relationships with many of these providers, increasingly. Shopping is an area where we are beginning to work together. And finally, I think cloud is another important way by which we can start working together. So, I do think we are seeing a lot of traction there. I gave the Carrefour example. We also announced strategic partnership and significant investment in JD.com, the second largest ecommerce company in China. Today, we are already, for example in Google Express we\u2019re partnering with over 100 merchants including national retailers like Walmart, Costco, Target, Walgreens and PetSmart. So, there is a lot of traction. I think we are building upon these relationships, trying to have more holistic conversations across the breadth of our offerings, and I think I see all being very synergistic. Ruth Porat : And then, in terms of Waymo. We remain very excited about the opportunity with Waymo. You\u2019ve seen us talk about our progress on a number of fronts. I think the main point is, it is still very early. But, in terms of our progress. So, 2018, the focus has been to launch the commercial rider program in Phoenix that we\u2019ve talked about, looking to do that by year-end. We do view that as a first step in building a more fully rolled out rider program in the future. And as we\u2019ve discussed on prior calls, we continue to trial the program in Phoenix with an emphasis on delivering a safe experience that delights users. We\u2019ve also continued to build out our vehicle relationships. You saw announcements regarding FCA and Jaguar. We\u2019re expanding our testing to more states. We\u2019re also working on additional areas such as logistics and deliveries. We talked this past quarter about licensing the technology for personal use vehicles, and we\u2019re also focused on working with cities to help strengthen public transportation. More specifically, you\u2019re focused on CapEx. As I said, we\u2019re excited about the long-term opportunity but creation of a new market does take time. and then on the CapEx versus OpEx, the way it works is once the commercial program is up and running beyond what\u2019s viewed as more of a development or R&D phase than much of the investments or CapEx versus OpEx. And that\u2019s for car sensors and any other spend. So, yes, we\u2019re excited. We do think it\u2019s really an important market, but it is still very early. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heather Bellini : Great. I just had two questions. One, I was wondering if you could talk about what you\u2019ve seen thus far with the rollout of GDPR? Anything you could share with us, and just how that\u2019s played out versus your expectations at this point? And then, Sundar, as you mentioned, with Google Next upon us, and you\u2019re obviously -- you guys are talking very positively about the business. But, are there anymore stats you can share with us, even about the growth rates in G Suite or GCP or combined? And then, when we think about this business scaling over time, is there any reason to think that the pace of gross margin progression would be materially different than say Azure, AWS at similar revenue levels? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Heather. On GDPR, obviously something we\u2019ve been working on for a long time well over 18 months, but the rollout just happened towards the end of second quarter. So, it\u2019s a bit early to us to say anything. But for us, it\u2019s been super important to get it right, and we\u2019ve always been focused on user privacy. But, it\u2019s been a big change for a lot of our partners as well. And so, we are working closely with our partners and regulators and committed to doing it right, but it\u2019s too early to tell. And on Google Next and Cloud, obviously the conference is tomorrow. So, I will hold for the announcements there. Couple of things, G Suite has definitely I think seen a lot of momentum, definitely have noticed in the -- now I think it can definitely serve the needs of a large enterprise, it\u2019s clear I gave the Carrefour for example. But increasingly, we are seeing big companies take on the migration. So, that\u2019s been four sure a positive development. And on Cloud, I think we are investing for the long run. We are definitely seeing traction. A lot of our effort, from a product and technology standpoint, we are definitely there and differentiated. It\u2019s been a lot about investing in our go-to-market efforts. And as we do it, both developing our in-house strength but as well as partnering, those things are beginning to pay dividends. And hopefully, you\u2019ll hear more details at tomorrow\u2019s conference. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my question there. I have two. The first one, the Google Assistant and the Hardware and Google Mini. I was curious, if you could just talk about sort of early learnings and differences in consumer behaviors, how they interact with those devices as opposed to mobile search and the phones? And they\u2019re always very focused on the long-term value proposition for users and advertisers. Maybe talk about the focus, and the hardware is long-term for users and advertisers. And Sundar, I appreciate your color on India and Indonesia and emerging markets. Talk about how you\u2019re strategically trying to position yourself for business potentially beyond advertising and payments or other areas in the countries, if you could, please? Sundar Pichai : So on Google Assistant, obviously, we see Google Assistant as an important evolution. And obviously, it\u2019s early days, but it\u2019s already exciting to see. People definitely are pushing the boundaries of what they can do with these devices, and home control and automation is a good example of the kind of use case that\u2019s very, very different consumer behavior and which is why our assets in Nest et cetera end up battling over time. So, there is a lot more actions, people are trying to get things done, which is definitely areas we are focused on. But, I think it\u2019s important to understand that experience not just in the context Home and Home Mini, but also your core mobile experience, how it evolves on the phone and across the streams, you\u2019ll have in your life. So, we\u2019re taking the end-to-end user experience in mind, and that\u2019s where all the investments we have done over many, many years I think will come into play as the product evolves. On your question about emerging markets, the user growth there is extraordinary to see. And we\u2019re seeing it across all our products. So, all our major products, products which have over a billion users each, they are all doing well in these markets. And so, that\u2019s where most of the growth is going to from. And so, it\u2019s an important area of focus. And we do see unique opportunities in these markets, which are different from the markets we are here in here in our more mature markets. You highlighted payments as a good example. And you\u2019ve seen us address that exclusively with Google Tez in India. And so, we will look to do more like that. And beyond just getting our products working better, we\u2019re going to opportunistic, we are investing in talent in these countries. And there is a lot of innovation, which is going to happen from these countries, both for their own markets and for the world beyond. And we want to be in a position to do that well. Operator : And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Doug Anmuth : Two, if I could. First, for Ruth. You talked about the higher cost, as you shift to machine learning driven business and then also your tech upgrade cycle around machine? Can you give us a sense of where you are in making those transitions and absorbing those investments from a cost perspective? And then, Sundar, mobile strength, clearly in the quarter. Can you just help us understand better how machine learning and AI or driving the stronger growth in mobile search and if there is any specific innovations or products you can point to that are driving that outsized growth? Thanks. Ruth Porat : So, in terms of your first question and kind of machine learning, and I think you\u2019re kind of getting at cycle. You\u2019re really seeing it in two places, and part of that is they called out is with respect to OpEx. We\u2019re hiring and what you\u2019re seeing is the investments we\u2019re making across the board, it\u2019s ads, it\u2019s cloud, it\u2019s hardware, it\u2019s the Assistant, but this is also very much in machine learning and we are really proud of the team that we have and given the opportunity set that they are able to address. And I think you were getting more broadly at CapEx. The way we\u2019re focused on CapEx, as I said last quarter as well, we view this as it lands into our outlook for growth and the required additional compute capacity. And there are number of growth drivers there. And part is really to support growth that we are seeing in our search and ads business that\u2019s really consistent with the momentum that we\u2019ve commented on today and the exciting opportunities that we see to further enhance the user and advertiser experience. It\u2019s also for our newer businesses, as I noted in opening comments. And then very importantly, it reflects the importance of machine learning across our products including search and ads. We\u2019ve talked about this in the past, machine learning is more compute intensive, but it also opens up more services and products across Alphabet, and that\u2019s what we are investing in to make sure that we\u2019ve got the capacity with best-in-class compute capacity. And so, the build is really machines, data centers and network infrastructure, and just to make sure and put a fine point on it, while we\u2019re ensuring that we\u2019re well positioned to support the growth we see. We do constantly remain focused on efficiency per unit of compute. We\u2019ve talked about that on many prior calls and are investing here for long-term value creation thoughtfully in order to be able to pursue the opportunities that we see ahead of us. Sundar Pichai : And Doug, on your question on how is machine learning driving the mobile search experience. The key thing is, it\u2019s doing it at a deeper foundational level. We\u2019ve obviously used machine learning across the board, be it our ranking, actually understanding the intent, the context around the query, and getting you the right answer. I think, the experience is -- I mean, the improvements are happening continuously. And so, we are -- I would just say we are getting deeper in terms of what we are able to do. In terms of specific innovations of products, it\u2019s super important to understand, I gave the Translate example earlier. While it may seem like a specific use case, it\u2019s obviously -- obviously, we can do translate well because of machine learning. But where it helps us is, we want Google to be the source you think of when you run into a problem. And the fact that the data shows that during the World Cup in Russia, our usage spiked up. To me it shows that when people are running into new things, new experiences, when they have questions on their mind, Google is what they are reaching out to. And I think the way we continue to do that well is by increasingly by using machine learning. So, that\u2019s the depth to which we think about this. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore. Your line is now open. Anthony DiClemente : Thank you very much. First for Sundar. You talked about Android in your prepared remarks. In your blog post you said that you are concerned that the Android ruling from the EC sends a troubling signal in favor of proprietary systems over open platform. So, I wonder how are you thinking about the possible business impact from this Android ruling, specifically on tying the Play Store from Search and the Chrome browser. And does it in any way change your strategic approach for Android going forward? And then, for Ruth, on the theme of OpEx investment trends, if we isolate just the other revenue businesses, Cloud, Play and Hardware, all growth drivers, but clearly structurally different in terms of the competitive landscape and profitability. You said, most of the headcount additions are in Cloud, but would love to understand more about how you prioritize investment across Cloud, Play and Hardware, those three? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On Android, I said in my blog post, Android has really worked well, I think globally for users for everyone in the ecosystem. You can clearly see there is robust competition. There is a lot of innovation, lower prices that has made Android possible at every price point. And so, I think overall, it\u2019s created more choice for everyone, not less. We are analyzing the decision, and I think it\u2019s too early to comment or speculate beyond what you\u2019ve already said. But we will -- we will always take a constructive approach. We\u2019ll appeal the Commission\u2019s decision and take the due process available to us. But, we are also looking forward to finding a solution above all that preserves the enormous benefits of Android to users and so on. So, there is small work to be done, and I think it will become clearer as we go along. But I\u2019m confident that we can find a way to make sure Android is available at scale to users, everyone. Ruth Porat : And in terms of your question, on investment priorities, I think one of the most important points to underscore is that one of the biggest opportunities for investment, continues to be in our ads business where we are continuing to investment meaningfully, given the opportunity set that we see there. Sundar commented on some of them, as did I, looking at opportunities to enhance the user experience, to continue to improve tools for advertisers, and both of which extend the growth there. And that\u2019s for mobile and what we are increasingly seeing, is, as we focus on mobile, the benefits are across platform and help explain the growth we\u2019re seeing in desktop and YouTube. So, we are continuing to invest here. I don\u2019t want to leave with an answer, with the notion that the investment is just pointed to the new business sets. And then, more specifically to your question, what we look at is the opportunity set, the -- each one of these is different. When we start with cloud, as Sundar commented, given the core capabilities that we are building upon, our technical infrastructure, security app, machine learning, analytical tools, our view is that we\u2019re addressing a rapidly growing market with the core pillars that are needed to win. And what has been the recurring theme that we\u2019ve talked about on these calls is the need to further build out our go to market capabilities and ensure that we\u2019ve got the functional requirements that enterprise customers deserver. So, it\u2019s really looking at the scale of the opportunity, the pace of investment that can be done effectively and therefore position us well. Our hardware business continues to deliver significant growth, particularly with the sales as a home family of products, and you\u2019ve seen us invest there. We talked about the HTC acquisition last quarter because this is a scale business. And the ability to operate as effectively as possible underscores the types of investments we\u2019re making. Play continues to benefit from broad-based app strength, it\u2019s been a long standing strength of ours, and we\u2019re continuing to invest as needed there. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Great, thanks. Two questions. It seems like your commentary on cloud is very positive. It seems like that\u2019s also what we\u2019re hearing from Microsoft. And my guess is from Amazon what they are seeing. Do you think we\u2019re just at a broad industry inflection point in terms of cloud adoption, and any thoughts as to why we\u2019re saying it now? And then, a question on advertising, there is just big bucket of ad spend called trade promotion spend, that\u2019s largely been offline I think, and it\u2019s almost as big maybe on a global basis as kind of traditional TV brand advertising. Any thoughts on that as an opportunity, whether there\u2019s an ability for that to really migrate heavily online and Google\u2019s ability to tap into those dollars? Thank you very much. Sundar Pichai : On the first question on cloud. For sure, I do think there is an inflection point. And that\u2019s why, it feels far from zero-sum game. I think all the major players are definitely seeing traction. And to me, the reason is, typically when you look at enterprises, once you\u2019ve deployed and you have an architecture, you try and stay on it as long as you can in many, many cases, but this change is hard. But, this is a case in which the benefits are super clear. And over time, I think, there is a tremendous cost to your business of being on the wrong architecture, especially if you need to digitally transform yourself, thinking through the cloud architecture becomes an important way by which you are improving your business. So, I think at a foundational level, it\u2019s clearly there on everyone\u2019s mind. It\u2019s not just on CEOs are asking questions about cloud. Almost all businesses I deal with, I can clearly see the question is on the mind of their CEO. And so, I think it\u2019s important. I also think it\u2019s going to be -- businesses are going to embrace multiple clouds over time too. So, I think not only is this early, but I think it is going to transform. And there is a lot of opportunity here. And our goal here is, it\u2019s something we view -- this is something we have built experience over 20 years. And we are thoughtfully gaining strengthen and committed to it for the very long term. Ruth Porat : And then, in terms of kind of trends in advertising, to your question. We have talked about this quite a bit in the past, over 90% of commerce is still offline, and we do see a great opportunity for digital to play a bigger role in that and tap into our budgets, into other budgets that have traditionally been there. And so, we are quite focused on the advertising opportunities, as said. And the fact that ad budgets are offline, and as we focus on, these are opportunity and the tools for advertisers, we see view that as another opportunity. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Dan Salmon : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Sundar, you mentioned in your prepared remarks or highlighted at least the launch of local campaigns at Marketing Live a couple of weeks ago. I recognize that\u2019s an initiative that will help drive demand across a number of Google properties. I\u2019m curious in particular about Maps, and with it being a product aimed at driving store visits, one would assume Maps would play an interesting part in that. And in the past, when we\u2019ve asked you about Maps, it was focused more on getting the user experience right. So, my question is, do you see local campaigns as something that drives a bit of incremental level of monetization of Maps. Sundar Pichai : Okay. I think it\u2019s a good question. Local is an extraordinary use case in mobile. Local mobile searches are growing faster than mobile searches for us and have increased by almost 50% in the last year alone. And we are continuing to invest in building a local experience that benefits merchants, users and advertisers. And local campaigns is something new which we announced at Google Marketing Live a couple of weeks ago. It\u2019s a new campaign where if you are a local business, it\u2019s designed to drive foot traffic to you. You provide us with your budget, business locations and creatives, and we use machine learning to automatically optimize the ads to appear across our properties. Right? And along with that, you\u2019ve rightly noticed that we are beginning to experiment with new ad format, which we have had in beta, but we\u2019re pushing on them a bit more in Maps itself, both promoted places and place page ads. So, these are important ways by which we are exploring the commercial opportunity around Maps. I\u2019ve always felt Maps is a tremendous asset we have. And we\u2019ve really focused on the user side of things. And we will continue to do so, because the growth is very, very high. So, we see a lot of headroom. But as that experience is -- as we get a better understand of it, we are developing our views on how we can bring monetization experiences. And so, these are all steps in that direction. But, we\u2019ll take it\u2019s slows and we\u2019ll continue to evolve it here. Operator : And our question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Ruth, the U.S. and Asia business has accelerated sequentially modestly, but Europe was down a touch. And I think there have been many questions around did GDPR have any impact, and Sundar said it was too early to call. But, is that just completely unrelated to what happened or maybe there is something else that\u2019s going on that resulted from the small downtick? Ruth Porat : Yes. I mean, the way we look at it is, we\u2019re pleased with the strength in each of the regions at 19% year-on-year growth in EMEA and a fixed basis where we\u2019re pleased with the strength in the business. And as Sundar said, I think it\u2019s too early to comment on GDPR. We then hope that that\u2019s geographic split gives you better sense of what\u2019s kind of the dynamics in each of the various region. And as we both commented on, as long as you raise the regional question, I\u2019ve got to comment on APAC here, really pleased with the growth, 34% on a fixed FX basis and it underscores Sundar\u2019s comments about terrific products and rapidly growing markets, as well as the superb leadership group. Mobile strength is the key there as well, and we\u2019re very pleased about the breadth by the country that we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re very focused on the region. So, as we look across the globe, pleased with the fact that it is -- all regions are contributing nicely. Brent Thill : And a quick follow-up for Sundar. You mentioned on the cloud business that you\u2019re getting strong traction among some of the big fundamental institutions. One of the big questions we get is around the heavily regulated industries like healthcare, financial. It feels like you\u2019re starting to get better referenceability there. Are you happy with where you sit across the more heavily regulated industries now versus the tech-focused industries where you sit right now? Sundar Pichai : Definitely, and I think that\u2019s where a lot of our investments have gone in, right, getting certifications needed, depending on the industry and building the features that you need. And that\u2019s clearly starting to have an impact, and both on GCP, but as well as G Suite. And so, we definitely are going to continue to build out our capabilities. And we\u2019ll be going after the opportunities in these areas very seriously. Operator : And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Colin Sebastian : I have a couple, maybe first going back to the commerce theme. I wanted to ask about Shopping Actions and level of adoption you might be seeing with that formats. And more generally, what do you envision monetization for Google Assistant, if we should still expect to see more of a transactional event to that platform? And then on TAC, in wonder if it\u2019s worth adding a more color perhaps in the tiny or how much of the second quarter benefited from the moderation in growth in sites TAC just so we can get a better sense as to how to model that expense item over the next few quarters? Sundar Pichai : Colin, on Google Assistant and Shopping Actions, there I do think it\u2019s been exciting to see the improvement there, but I still would like that experience they\u2019ve all a lot more before we play around with monetization. And in all of these areas, we always set a high bar to make sure the user experience is working well. You have seen us do that with Maps or something like that. And I think today while we have taken promising steps with Shopping Actions for all of us to really work well and to delight users. I still feel we have some work ahead of us and that\u2019s what we are focused on. So, we will stay focused there, get the experience and then that will give us new avenues to monetize it. I've seen this with YouTube now, beyond ads we are experimenting with a lot of new formats, and the same thing here. So, I am pretty confident of our ability to do that well, if we get the user experience right. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of TAC, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past TAC as a percentage of revenues is affected by quite a number of factors. The main point is that we do continue to expect the TAC rate to increase on a year-on-year basis. And the primary reason is when we talked about really in the past that it\u2019s the underlying shift to mobile which carries higher TACs than desktop. So, on a year-on-year basis, that\u2019s the trend that you are really seeing as the ongoing strength in mobile. Over the past four quarters, changes in partnership agreements have also been a driver of increases in the TAC rate and then there are host of other factors that we\u2019ve talked about they can have an impact in any quarter like device mix or partner mix or mix of organic and pay distribution points. And so, as we called out last quarter, we did expect the pace of year-on-year growth in the sites TAC rate to slow beginning in this quarter, the second quarter, and you can clearly see that in the data. And as we\u2019ve repeatedly said, it is most effective to focus on year-on-year changes given the significance of this shift to mobile and mobile growth. And so variations in quarter-on-quarter move are less instructive. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Michael Nathanson : One for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, firstly. You went through a lot of your initiatives in your opening comments, but didn\u2019t mention Verily. So can you talk a bit about what the bottlenecks are then to be solved by you or your clients before you can scale the Verily opportunity? And then for Ruth, you\u2019ve been clear on the CapEx ramp is due to you are investing ahead of growth. What is usual timeframe do you think, do you see where those investments to pay off? And what factors would make the CapEx to sale ratio start growing even faster from here? Those were my questions. Sundar Pichai : Broadly, Verily is clearly set up us an other bet, and they are doing really important work on healthcare, if we look at the recent progress on their diabetes monitoring and so on. So they\u2019re in deep work and they have a lot more talk about. Across healthcare, we see a big opportunity for both Google and Alphabet. It\u2019s a vertical, which is very important for Cloud. And we are obviously helping a lot of healthcare partners across their needs. And Verily is definitely doing a very specialized solutions in this area. And we\u2019ll have a lot more to say on all of this over the course of time. Ruth Porat : And then, with respect to CapEx, look, I think, our view is that what you are saying here is an aggressive piece of investment, given our outlook for growth. And as I said the required additional Compute capacity, we are quite focused on the kind of full resource utilization across businesses. If I go back to couple of years when we incorporated stock-based compensation into the way we are talking about the businesses, I made the point that that is helpful, both externally and internally, and looking at resource utilization, the same is clearly true of CapEx. And we are quite focused on long-term value creation, focused on ensuring that we\u2019re pursuing attractive opportunities in a prudent, appropriate way to capture the opportunity while making sure that we\u2019re looking at the full again resource requirement. So, at this point, that\u2019s an interesting way of framing the question, how does it grow even faster from here. We\u2019re quite focused on this thing, an aggressive piece and an appropriate one, given the opportunities that we see, and it is a class data centers, machines and network infrastructure as I said. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Thank you. I just want to get into website growth. First, maybe you can help us a little bit understand strength in mobile search. Are there new any ad formats or ad changes? You mentioned local, anything to call out there? And then, just wondering, given the YouTube controversies last year, did YouTube accelerate this quarter? And what are some of the big content areas that you are investing in? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So, in terms of sites revenue, I think, our view is ongoing strength reflects our focus on improving the user experience and enhancing tools for advertisers. And both Sundar and I have spoken about them. We\u2019ve got an intense focus on innovation that we\u2019ve discussed previously that\u2019s enabled us to deliver over a 100 innovations each quarter. And really exciting area is the benefit of machine learning. It\u2019s a valuable driver of our growth, not only enhancing experiences for users but the tools that we talked about for advertisers and for app developers, certainly helping them find the right audience, to be able to optimize campaigns at scale, to deliver more relevant and higher quality ads. Sundar talked about a number of them. The Google Marketing Live, we\u2019ve really highlighted what we\u2019re seeing there and the benefits, whether we\u2019re talking about responsive search ads or local campaigns, smart shopping campaigns, another great example is universal app campaigns. So, across the board. And again, I made this comment previously about the benefit we\u2019re seeing on mobile is extending to the growth opportunities across platforms. Sundar Pichai : Yes. And I\u2019d add that a good way to think about it is, today, there is a lot of complexity you need to deal with to have advertiser, and increasingly we are using machine learning to do all the hard work and get them to focus on the business problem they are trying to solve. And that turns out to be a big driver overall. On YouTube, we definitely are continuing to see great product momentum, it\u2019s the user adoption and interest and our metrics are very strong, continues to grow and the growth is global. And we see it across many, many verticals. And overall, we\u2019ve invested a lot in making sure we are delivering the content responsibly. And it\u2019s been a big area of focus across Google. We are investing a lot in people to review the content that\u2019s going, improving the policies. And again, using machine learning to make all of this work better. And I think people are noticing it including our advertisers and they\u2019re engaging with the platform more. So, I would say overall, there is a lot of momentum there. And I\u2019m excited about it. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any closing remarks. Ellen West : Great. Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today. And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Ellen. Our revenues in the third quarter continued to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, cloud and desktop search, resulting in consolidated revenues of $33.7 billion, up 21% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency. For today's call, I will begin with the results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google followed by Other Bets and will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights after which we will take your questions. Starting with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter, our total revenues of $33.7 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $385 million or $305 million after the impact of our hedging program. Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, you can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $15.5 billion, up 20% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $11 billion, up 20% year-over-year. In constant currency terms EMEA grew 19%. APAC revenues were $5.4 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 30% in constant currency. Other Americas revenues were $1.8 billion, up 19% year-over-year and up 28% in constant currency, reflecting weakening of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $14.3 billion, up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.7 billion, up 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation which continue to be affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube. Operating expenses were $11.1 billion, up 26% year-over-year. Once again the biggest increase was in R&D expenses, reflecting our continued investment in technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects increases in sales and marketing head count primarily for cloud and ads followed by advertising investments in cloud, Chromebooks for the back-to-school season and the Google Assistant. G&A expense trends in the third quarter were affected by a number of factors. In particular, the performance fees accrued in connection with recognition of equity security gains which were again partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A primarily to other cost of revenues. Stock-based compensation totaled $2.2 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 94,372, up 5,314 from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count increases were in cloud for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $8.3 billion, up 7% versus last year for an operating margin of 25%. As discussed in the previous two quarters, both operating income and OI&E are affected by the new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. This new standard continues to result in greater volatility. Once again, we've provided a table in our earnings press release to highlight the impact on particular line items. Other income and expense was $1.8 billion which includes $1.4 billion of gains in equity security investments. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 8.8% for the third quarter, reflecting discrete items, notably an adjustment associated with the U.S. Tax Act. Net income was $9.2 billion and earnings per diluted share were $13.06. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $5.3 billion which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $13.2 billion with free cash flow of $7.9 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $106 billion. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $33.6 billion, up 21% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $24.1 billion in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search. Network revenues were $4.9 billion, up 13% year-on-year reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and programmatic. Other revenues for Google were $4.6 billion, up 29% year-over-year fueled by cloud and Play. We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.6 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 20% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was relatively flat year-over-year, primarily reflecting a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites, offset by an increase in the sites' TAC rate. The increase in the sites' TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC. This quarter, we experienced a year-on-year decline in the network TAC rate due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant. Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.1 billion for the quarter, up 23% year-over-year. Operating income was $9.5 billion, up 11% versus last year. And the operating margin was 28.2%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.6 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction and facilities. Let me now turn to Other Bets. Revenues were $146 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $727 million. Other Bets' accrued CapEx was $55 million. In terms of Other Bet updates for the quarter, with Waymo in the third quarter, we built on our early rider program, both expanding the group of participants and beginning to test pricing models. At Verily, the team continues to execute on its various partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies, consistent with its mission to move medicine from reactive to proactive. Recently launched efforts include a joint venture with ResMed to focus on sleeping disorders and a research collaboration with Gilead. Finally, you can see in our results the benefit and quality of our investment teams GV and CapitalG which are also within Other Bets. Within the $1.4 billion of reported gains in equity securities in OI&E, approximately $400 million was realized in Q3. There will be more detail on these investment activities in the 10-Q. Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. First, with respect to revenues. In the third quarter, results reflect FX headwinds with U.S. dollar strengthening in contrast to the tailwinds that enhanced reported results in the first half of the year. We continue to be pleased with the underlying momentum in our advertising businesses as we apply our strength in machine learning to improve the experience for users and advertisers. As we noted, hardware was only a modest contributor in the third quarter as we launched a new Made by Google family of products for the fourth quarter holiday season. Second, with respect to profitability, within cost of revenues, the biggest component is TAC. We indicated on the fourth quarter 2017 call that the pace of year-on-year growth in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues would begin to slow after the first quarter of 2018, and you can see that again clearly in our results this quarter. As frequently discussed, we do expect the sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search. Looking ahead, we expect seasonal impacts to our other cost of sales from hardware sales which are typically higher in the fourth quarter of the year as well as from increased content acquisition costs for YouTube, which have also historically been higher in the fourth quarter. Within OpEx, we continue to prioritize our investments to support long-term growth. In terms of head count, growth was seasonally higher in the third quarter because we brought on new graduates. We are continuing to invest in adding talent to our priority areas, particularly for technical roles in engineering and product management and to support our most sizable growth areas, in particular, cloud. As I've mentioned previously regarding sales and marketing, expenses are more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year. As you have seen in prior years, these expenses are particularly elevated in the fourth quarter to support the holiday season. Other Bets remains a portfolio of earlier stage businesses focused on addressing sizable markets. We are moving toward early stages of commercialization, while continuing to calibrate the pace of investment against achievement of key milestones. And finally, with respect to CapEx, you can see our continued investment as we build the infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see across our businesses. This includes a number of datacenter construction projects in flight as well as ongoing expansion in our compute capacity. I will now turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Ruth. We had a great quarter, and it was particularly special because last month, we celebrated Google's 20th birthday and the 10th birthday of Chrome. It's exciting to think that 20 years in, we are still just at the beginning of what's possible. We get billions of questions from users every day and about 15% of those are queries we have never seen before. Our mission to make the world's information accessible and useful is as relevant today as when we started. I want to begin by highlighting our recently launched family of hardware. It's a great example of how we bring together Google's strengths to help people through their day. Then I'll touch on ways AI is helping us approach our mission. I'll give an update on our video and advertising platforms. And finally, I'll talk about our growing cloud business. First, hardware. Every year, we have a new opportunity to push the boundaries of computing. Those experiences come to life in our Made by Google hardware, which combines the latest advances in software, hardware and AI. Our third generation is our best yet. It includes the Pixel 3, Google Home Hub, the Pixel Slate tablet and more. We're getting great feedback, and I'm very excited for users to try these devices, especially as the holiday season approaches. Our new hardware lineup showcases the best of Google, including the Google Assistant, Android and Chrome. With the Pixel 3, we've used AI to create a best-in-class camera. New features like top shot make it so you never miss a shot. If your timing wasn't perfect, the camera will suggest a better frame and give you the option to save it. And Night Sight will help you take really good pictures even in bad light. Pixel 3 also has a custom security chip called Titan M. It was built to secure Google's own datacenters and now we are bring it to our users. We also released Google Home Hub, our first smart speaker with a screen. It shows your morning commute, lets you control your smartphone and gives you hand-free help in the kitchen, and Pixel Slate, Chrome OS reimagined as a tablet with all the great apps from the Play Store. Our hardware efforts are picking up real momentum. For example, daily active users of our Google Home devices have grown by over 5x in the last year alone. I'm incredibly proud of our growing hardware team, including the talented employees who came over from HTC and Nest. Our investments are paying off as we bring the best of Google to more users and in more countries around the world. Even as we build up our hardware business, we continue to advance our mission across our core products and platforms. Last month, we kicked off 20 years of Google search by introducing some of the biggest updates in many years. They include a new AI powered ranking approach that delivers more relevant results, a redesigned Google feed called Discover to help you stay informed on topics that matter to you and a new search experience for Google images. We also continue to tackle the information problem of connecting people to relevant jobs right from search. This has already helped connect to over 100 million people in 92 countries to job listings that meet their needs and skills. Now U.S. service members can search for jobs for veterans and enter their military occupational code to see relevant civilian jobs. The Google Assistant continues to gain traction, drawing on our strengths in machine learning and helpful Google services like search, YouTube and Maps. We have expanded the Assistant to 20 languages and 76 countries and it can now understand and speak more than one language at a time. We launched our first set of smart displays with Lenovo and JBL as well as our own Google Home Hub. Pixel users in the U.S. will be the first to try our new duplex technology which helps you complete real-world tasks over the phone like calling a restaurant to book a table and we introduced a new way to easily book ride services with your Google Assistant. In Maps, we also made several improvements including a commute tab with live traffic and transit information and support for mixed-mode commutes. Earlier this month, we announced an exciting test called Project Stream. We are working with video game publisher Ubisoft to stream their latest game, Assassin's Creed Odyssey to Chrome browsers on laptops and desktops. Streaming graphically rich content for video games represents a great technical advance and we look forward to seeing what's possible here. I'm particularly proud of our strengths in AI are creating life-changing contributions in other fields. For example, our recent flood prediction efforts, which use AI to better predict when floods will occur had the potential to help millions of people get out of harm's way. We are starting in India, where 20% of flood-related fatalities occur today, and we're looking to expand to more countries soon. Earlier this month, our research has showed how they've applied deep learning models to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for metastatic breast cancer. Our research found that pathologists and AI can work together more effectively than either alone. Moving to our video and advertising platforms, which are creating economic opportunities for partners around the world. First YouTube. One particular area of focus is educational content. Every day people from all over the world turn to YouTube to learn something new from career skills to coding to cooking. Just this week, we announced a $20 million investment to expand our YouTube Learning initiative which will help fund established and emerging educational careers. We're also partnering with organizations like Goodwill and Year Up to create curated playlists that teach career skills directly in our new learning channel. YouTube's Ask business continues to provide great results for marketers and creators. At Advertising Week, we announced that we'll be expanding our popular TrueView for actions format. This helps users take action directly from video ads. They can now do things like sign up for a newsletter and soon they'll be able to find movie show times, download apps or even book a trip right from the app. For creators, YouTube is continuing to build alternative revenue products like Super Chat, channel memberships and the ability to sell merchandise directly to fans. YouTube gaming creator, Marquis player (19:55), increased its revenue by 20% using channel memberships. We continue to see positive traction for our newest subscription experiences too. YouTube Premium YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium are continuing to expand to many new countries. The team is also investing in growing and improving the news experience on YouTube. More prominently surfacing credible news sources on the platform is a big priority for us. Next, our advertising platforms. Advertisers love that we are bringing our machine learning strengths to offerings like responsive search ads and universal App Campaigns to create more effective ads. One new example is Smart Shopping Campaigns which use signals like seasonality and price to optimize where ads are shown. Tens of thousands of advertisers are using this and seeing an average of 20% more sales for the same budget. Just last week we announced that Nike, Best Buy and Sephora are joining our Shopping Actions program. This allows people to move seamlessly from browsing to buying with a universal card that works across Google search and our system. In apps, we announced a partnership with Unity Technologies, which gives our advertisers access to one of the largest global networks of mobile gaming titles across 1.5 billion devices. Unity's developers can monetize their apps with Google ads without any additional development work. And lastly, our growing cloud business. At Google Cloud Next, we made over 100 announcements including the Titan security key, which features Google designed firmware to help verify that nothing on a customer's key has been tampered with. And we expanded our breakthrough Cloud AutoML portfolio, which now includes vision, natural language and translation. And all over the world we are seeing great customer adoption of our Cloud Platform. With help of SAP, Metro, one of the largest B2B wholesalers globally, is centralizing their finance system on Google Cloud Platform. They're using BigQuery to generate data-driven insights to help create more personalized marketing campaigns. In the U.S., we partnered with the National Institutes of Health to provide access to cloud services that help researchers access large datasets to accelerate biomedical advances. We also added new customers like ING and Broadcom, joining existing customers like PayPal, ANZ Bank and Kroger. Our G Suite business continues to fuel transformation in companies large and small and we crossed two important milestones in the quarter. Google Drive became the eight Google product with 1 billion monthly active users. And Gmail now has more than 1.5 billion monthly active users. One of our big wins in the quarter was Fast Retailing, the Japanese retailer best known for its popular brand UNIQLO, which is migrating its employees globally to G Suite, while also pursuing AI solutions like on-demand forecasting on Google Cloud Platform. Our cloud business is benefiting from our investments in technical infrastructure including a U.S.-Europe cable that will improve speeds for millions of people. Before I wrap up, I want to quickly call out our continued momentum in Asia as well as the investments that we are making in the U.S. As you can see from our results, revenue growth in APAC remains strong. This is a reflection of our very focused efforts to build great experiences for the billions of people across the region. We have adapted many of our core products like search, Maps and YouTube to work well for the next generation of users coming online. We're also building products to meet the specific needs of users in the region like Tez, a digital payments app for India, to help people easily pay their electrician or split it in a bill with just a few taps. Just one year since it launched, over 30 million people in businesses across India now use the app every month and they've collectively made more than 1 billion transactions. We have recently rebranded the app to Google Pay as we look to bring many of the app's features to others around the world. We are also investing closer to home. In Q3, more than 80% of Alphabet's total capital expenditures was within the U.S. Not only do these investments in datacenters, machines and offices allow us to provide great services to users, they have a strong positive impact on the communities around them, supporting thousands of jobs and countless local businesses. This year-to-date we have added over 9,000 new employees in the U.S. and we continue to grow faster outside the Bay Area than in it. As you can see, there's exciting momentum across many different areas. I'm constantly struck by the number of incredible opportunities ahead of us as a company and how far we have come over the last 20 years. I want to say a big thank you to all of Googlers around the world who help us deliver on that mission every day. With that, I'll hand it back to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Sundar, and we will now take your questions. Operator : And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open. Eric J. Sheridan: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two for Sundar if I can. Referencing the blog post and some of the changes about how you see the future of search, I wanted to know what some of the key investments you think the company needs to make so that search becomes more visual or relevant and what that might mean tying it back to the business for engagement with your products relevant to that medium to long term. And then with respect to your comments on YouTube, we're starting to hear from advertisers that there is some blurring between brand and direct response ad budgets as they look at products maybe more across blended lines. It sounds like the YouTube announcements coming out of Adweek were about making YouTube more responsive or more direct response. How are you thinking about the blurring of those lines and what it means for product development long term? Thanks so much. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Eric. I'll take the two. The first on search. You're right that search, we are always trying to anticipate what the user experience expectations are and trying to meet them there. And increasingly in mobile, people do want immersive engaging experiences. They want their experiences to be more visual and that's partly what you saw us announce in our 20th birthday event. And we are excited to move in that direction. And I do think we have a lot of important assets to bring here. YouTube is a big part of what we do. We are investing in image search and we do have products like Google Maps and Photos which all add to the visual experience. And as part of doing that, we are investing in our advertising offerings as well. And so over time, we'll adapt that so they go hand-in-hand. But I think it's an important evolution for us. In terms of YouTube, I think part of what makes YouTube great is I think we can offer different opportunities for advertisers. We've always felt direct response is something that can work well on YouTube. And our instinct is bearing out. And I look at my personal use cases that are many times now sometimes instead of search, actually find something I want to do in YouTube, maybe thinking about going to a place. And I research it on YouTube. So I think it offers the same opportunity over time. And from our standpoint, we want to make sure that we are evolving the product to bring those opportunities to advertisers. So I'm very excited by it. Eric J. Sheridan: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Daniel Salmon : Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, two questions for you. First, earlier this month or it might have been late last month, Sridhar Ramaswamy, your Head of Ads and Commerce left to go to a VC firm. I'm betting that wasn't a surprise to you, but I'm just hoping you could shed a little light on sort of succession planning for that important role and whether or not you expect any sort of broad changes to ad product strategy. And then second, just amongst those announcements on the anniversary were the evolution of Feed to Discover. And I recognize that's an evolution of a product, but it does look like you're taking advantage of that long unused white space on google.com. And so, just love to hear a little bit more, just sort of a follow-up on Eric's question on the evolution of search, but how you see that surface in particular evolving and particularly the potential for ad monetization over time. Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Good. On the first one, look I mean we, one of the things I'm really proud about Google is we have a deep bench of talent and for example in the ads team almost all of our senior ads leadership has been here for well over a decade. And so for us, we are fortunate to be able to tap into it. Our ads leadership comes \u2013 Prabhakar who has taken over our ads product and engineering efforts, someone I worked with for many, many years, and most recently has led our G Suite business, but has done many roles before, is a deep computer scientist. And I expect to, for him to continue our tradition of technical excellence with the \u2013 approach our advertising work. Also want to mentioned Philip and his team, his extraordinary team, who definitely lead many of our initiatives here. And Philip and Prabhakar, with them I think it's in great hands. And I expect a lot of continuity there. On your question on search and Discover, it's in addition to making search more visual, one of the things we are very, very focused on is not always do users turn to us and actually ask a question. So we feel our job is to be there when users need us, anticipate what they want and sometimes proactively meet them. That's where services like Discover really play a role. Right? And I think we are thinking hard about how we can surface relevant information for our users, stuff they are really looking for, can act on, in a way in which it's delightful for them and is showing up for them when they need it. So I see that as an important evolution of search as well. And so you're going to see us investing more. Mobile offers us a great opportunity. And if you use it in Pixel 3, that's the latest product in which we bring our vision of how to bring all these products together and we'll give you a good sense of how we plan to do that over time. Daniel Salmon : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Anthony DiClemente : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. First for Sundar, you spent some time on hardware. You spent time discussing your suite of hardware devices, the Google Assistant, the Pixel. How are you measuring the returns on those investments in hardware, both in the products and on the marketing side here in a pretty competitive marketplace? What are the milestones for success that we should be looking for on hardware? And then for Ruth, as we start to look ahead to 2019, as you plan for 2019, how are you thinking about the relationship between revenue growth and dollars of operating income growth for next year, particularly if the macroeconomic environment were to become, let's say, less of a tailwind to the broader ads environment as it was this year and in prior years? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On hardware, we always want to be at the forefront of computing. And so, and a lot of times that involves thinking across the whole stack, bringing together the entire experience in an integrated way for our users. And we genuinely see a very differentiated way to do this. We think of our approach of bringing together AI software and hardware is unique and we think we can deliver the best-in-class experience and we are committed to doing it. At the same time, we want to build a great business here as well. So we are investing in the long run because we see it clearly as an important business opportunity for us as well, so both go hand-in-hand. We closely look at metrics, and the metrics we have been very focused on for the last couple of years. This is our third generation of hardware. It's the first time we actually are doing our products end-to-end, and we've expanded to newer categories. We look at user feedback and reception. We measure NPS scores. And our scores are now reflecting best-in-class in the category. And beyond that, we're looking at how the market adoption is and we are thoughtfully building a business but we are committed to building and investing for the long run. Ruth Porat : And in terms of how we're thinking about planning, we're in the middle of it now. And many of the questions sort of been already asked sort of point to the direction that we feel really good about the underlying strength in the ads business as we've talked about on numerous calls. We continue to invest here because we see ongoing opportunities in particular as we leverage machine learning to provide better experience for users and for advertisers. And some of the comments that Sundar made about the opportunities that open up with visual search again continue to point the direction direct response, continue to point to some of the underlying areas in which we're focused. But as we've talked about on prior calls, that's one element of it, and we continue to invest for opportunities that are sizable over the long term. Sundar has already commented on both hardware and cloud as really important examples, and we think the steps that we're taking, the investments we're making, provide the foundational support for ongoing long-term sustained growth. And so then we marry that with the second part of your question, which is in how do we think about the pace of investment. As we've said repeatedly, we're very focused on investing for the long term. We're trying to make sure that we prioritize crisply across the opportunity set that we have and we make the right types of trade-offs but we do remain focused on long-term investing given the scale of the opportunities that we see. Anthony DiClemente : Got it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. Two questions please. One, Sundar, could you just update us with your thinking on China and the China market and the extent. I know Google is already in that market, but the extent to which you want to expand, re-expand your presence there with search. And then in terms of Waymo, just a quick question. Commercialization of Waymo, do you know when, do you have a sense of when you'll have pricing established and you'll have a roughly well-defined and acted on go-to-market strategy with Waymo? Is that the end of this year, beginning of next year, whenever? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : And, Mark, on China, we obviously, we deeply care about serving Chinese users. We've been investing for many years and especially from developing Android. But more recently, we have launched mobile apps such as Google Translate and Files Go and improved our developer tools there. So we are constantly looking for ways by which we can better serve Chinese users. And that's where we are today. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of Waymo, in the third quarter, as I think you know, we extended our Early Rider Program to a larger group and we moved into very early days of commercialization. So we do now have people paying for rides and we're also testing pricing models. I think the main point, we've said this repeatedly is that, we are intently focused on safety first and ensuring a great user experience. And so what that means is, we're really expanding the program methodically. We're taking an iterative approach as we continue to broaden the geographic footprint. And then on top of that, as we've talked about on prior calls, we've been developing the B2B opportunity. So in Phoenix, as an example, we've been piloting with several partners who are sponsoring a service on behalf of their employees and customers. And again it's early days. So small revenues, but we're pleased to be testing this out as well, and then on top of that continuing to explore applying our technology for logistics and deliveries and for personal use vehicles and for last mile solutions for cities. So you can see a move in the third quarter. But as we said repeatedly, it's very early days and we are taking a very deliberate iterative approach to broadening it out. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Ruth. Thank you, Sundar. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on map monetization and putting some more ads in the map. Can you just talk about sort of early learnings there? I know you talked about local mobile searches growing quite rapidly in the past. But any early learnings from the monetization and the return that advertisers are getting on that front? And the second one on video games and Project Stream. Could you just talk a little about how you think about the gaming opportunity for Alphabet, and what you think are the key factors you need to tackle to really build and scale direct-to-consumer facing cloud gaming product. Sundar Pichai : Look, on the ad stuff, we've had ad formats in Maps for some time and we are constantly working to make it more useful and relevant. But I wouldn't underestimate the focus we have on local. Just to give you a sense, local mobile searches are growing faster than just mobile searches overall, and have increased by almost 50% in the last year. So for us, that's an important focus area and Maps plays a big role there. So we recently announced Local campaigns, which is a new campaign type specifically designed to drive foot traffic to local businesses, right. And it's going to roll out in the coming months. And so that is a big focus. And as you pointed out, we are definitely launching and experimenting with newer ad formats on Maps itself. We have promoted places which appears on the map itself. We have place page ads which appear on Google listings in Maps and search. But we are definitely in the phase of putting those, testing it out, making sure the user experience works and making sure we can deliver value for advertisers. We are being patient here because the opportunity in local search, it's a big opportunity and we are focused there. On your second question, look, we today serve our users on gaming across Google ads but in many ways, right. Obviously, Google Play does this a lot. It's a big important vertical on YouTube. And so we touch with gaming developers across many areas already. And so we are thoughtfully thinking about what more we can do there. And Project Stream, having spent my life on computing. I was blown away by seeing our ability to stream a game which needs real-time interactions and to be able to do that from the cloud. And it's one of the most important technological advances I've seen in a while. And so we are going to focus on that and make sure we are making progress there and bring newer experiences for gamers. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Douglas T. Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar, one for Ruth. Sundar, can you help us better understand how the remedy in Europe will work in terms of licenses and TAC going forward? And what impact do see that having on financials? And then Ruth, can you just talk about where you are in the hardware replacement cycle in your datacenters? Pretty major step up this year just given that large ramp. How are you thinking about the trajectory into 2019? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Doug. On Europe, I mean it's early to say. We'll begin only implementing the remedy in the next few weeks. But in all these cases, we always, we're focused on complying with the commission's directive and we want to make sure that the transition for both our users and our OEM partners is as smooth as possible. In this case you're dealing with life cycles for mobile phones. So changes is going to take some time to reach users. And it's difficult to predict how the licensing model will be adopted. But our products are very popular with users across platforms. And so it's early to say but we're focused on doing the right thing there. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of technical infrastructure and our CapEx as we talked about last quarter, CapEx reflects our view of the growing opportunity set in our core ads and search businesses as well as the longer-term opportunities in newer businesses in particular to support cloud. And then very importantly, as we've talked about machine learning across Alphabet. And we're particularly excited about the opportunity with machine learning, because it opens up more services and products for users and for advertisers and for enterprise customers. And so given our view about the long-term potential with these opportunities, we're very focused on ensuring that we have the needed compute capacity to support growth. And that's what you're really seeing with the uptick in investment. To give you a bit of a breakdown, the largest component continues to be machines. But relative to last year, it's important to note that datacenter construction is an increasing percentage of our CapEx investment. And so we're now in various stages of developing more than 20 datacenter sites globally. We're also investing in network infrastructure such as undersea cables so we can deliver speed and quality. So again this really goes to our view of the opportunity set. That being said, we do remain very focused on optimizing the use of CapEx and also on compute efficiency. We're very mindful of the fact that our decisions here on CapEx don't just result in CapEx spend but also translate into higher depreciation expenses and that goes both to cost of sales and OpEx. So very careful about how we're using it, but I want to make sure that we've built for the requirements that we have. And as much as you asked about technical infrastructure, just a quick note that our facility spend, namely real estate, was more muted this quarter and it was primarily just the ongoing work on our ground up development. So you're primarily seeing what's going on, on technical infrastructure here. Douglas T. Anmuth: Great. Thank you both. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is now open. Ross Sandler : Great. Two questions. Ruth, so you guys posted pretty solid growth all around. But if we look at some of the international markets, each geography had a tougher comp and decelerated a little bit on a currency-neutral basis. So, I guess, stepping that high level, the growth rates are solid. But can you give us any color on the overall macro picture here? I think we're getting mixed feedback from different companies across different sectors. So any high-level comments would be helpful on just the ad market given that you're close to 20% of global advertising ex-China. And then, Sundar, question on I guess Pixel and just the overall advance that you're seeing in smartphone devices. So as you guys roll out more products like Lens and Gboard and some of these other utilities on top of your 1 billion-plus apps like search and YouTube, is there any way to parse out what the overall engagement looks like in markets like the U.S. and Western Europe when the phones are improving their functionality and can you keep adding these additional utilities? Is query volume going up on a per user basis? Any color there will be helpful. Ruth Porat : So in terms of your first question, we actually felt pretty good about the strength globally, which as I noted in opening comments, across the board, 20% growth in the U.S. on a $15 billion base. As Sundar noted, what's going on in APAC, 30% year-on-year growth. It's now over a $5 billion revenue business and we've had sustained quarter after quarter growth at this kind of 30%-ish area, feel really good about that. And by country, it really does reflect broad-based strength. As he said, we're very focused on the region. And I think we're delivering terrific products and experiences in rapidly growing markets. You see the same thing in other Americas, neutralizing for currency movements, 28% year-on-year growth. So we're really proud of what the teams are doing around the globe. Sundar Pichai : And on your second question, one of the things we clearly see when we make a hardware product like Pixel, in which all the tools and the utilities we build are conveniently there integrated and the experience is great. We definitely see users engaging more. And so, we see an opportunity. And that's one of the bigger reasons why we do hardware as well, to show that into an experience, both for our ecosystem as well as for us. It helps us give users a much deeper engaged experience as well. And when you look at all our products, we see that. And so, we do see that as an opportunity. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Michael Brian Nathanson : Thanks. I have two for Sundar, kind of the same theme. One is on the Pixel 3. The marketing message is clear. The product looks great. But I wonder, when you look at to date the success ramping the product, what's been the gating factor? Has it been the carriers? Has it been the price? And we look at the factors for why it hasn't scaled as much as the product should have a scaled, what are the factors? And then on Verily, you called out some deals you've had with big pharmaceutical companies this quarter. But again there I wonder, who's your most natural partnership? Is it hospitals, insurance, governments? So we think about the big opportunity, where is the most natural fit to drive Verily going forward? Sundar Pichai : On Pixel, look, first of all, part of the big thing is this is our third generation of hardware. Each generation, first of all, we've been scaling up the product in terms of even the number of units we can make and so on. So if you remember the first couple generations were struggling to meet the early demand we saw. This is the first year we have done it end-to-end and we are ramping up from there. And so each year when I look at all the metrics, be it NPS or be it our sales, be it our reviews, etcetera, everything is progressing well. But there are, you're right, the gating factors to ramp this up, first of all is to be able to build the supply we need. And second is go-to-market, getting ourselves in as many locations in retail as possible, in as many countries as possible with as many carrier certifications as possible. So in each of those dimensions, we are making progress as well. Ruth Porat : In terms of Verily, what we've talked about there is, they have partnered with a whole host of leading pharmaceutical companies focusing on specific diseases, whether it's diabetic retinopathy or across the board for neurological diseases. I announced a couple of new partnerships, the ResMed arrangement as well as Gilead. And that's what they tend to do. They partner with best-in-class to focus on specific areas where working with the pharmaceutical companies they can, and the technology we have, and benefiting from machine learning, we can really move from reactive to proactive care. That's the Verily focus. Michael Brian Nathanson : Thanks, Ruth. Thanks, Sundar. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you. I just wanted to focus on cloud a little bit more. Sundar, you gave some good color in your prepared remarks. But I'm wondering if you could share with us an update maybe on the partner momentum and direct sales momentum you're seeing in the market, how you've seen that change? And also if you could highlight, if you've noticed if there's been noticeable changes in win rates over the last year as the product continues to mature. And you, also in the beginning of the year and exiting Q4, you would give us some high-level growth commentary about GCP. and I'm just wondering if you have anything else you could share? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Heather. Look, overall I mean it's now we've been doing this seriously at the next level for three years. And we are definitely seeing strong indicators that are the investment in product is clearly beginning to work. Our value proposition does come through in many competitive situations. I've seen many important wins in what seemed like very, very competitive situations. I also don't, from the way we see it, it doesn't look like a zero-sum game as you know. We're addressing a large market opportunity here. It seems like very early days. And more importantly, the general sense I get is, we're very aligned with where the market is headed in the long run. And this notion of supporting open architecture so that enterprises don't feel locked in and allowing for a multi-cloud environment to develop. That's the direction we are betting on and our indications are that the market is headed in that direction as well. So that gives us a lot of comfort. That gives us a lot of comfort as well. And on-the-go to market side, we have really ramped up both in terms of our investments, our direct investments, but also our partnership strategy is beginning to work. And when I look at the pipeline ahead that's we are clearly seeing momentum there as well. In this business, obviously the enterprise business plays in a way in which you do have wins, but those accounts turn into larger revenue deals over time. And so it's very clear to us that we are laying the foundation and we are getting the strong early momentum. And that's the big reason why we are investing in a strong way in the area. And over time, we'll obviously share more here as well. Heather Bellini : And could I just ask one follow-up if possible? I was just wondering if you look at Microsoft, they have a on-premise and cloud strategy. If you look at Amazon ,what they're doing with AWS and VMware, they're kind of doing a similar strategy. Do you think there's a requirement for you to also have an on-premise strategy to solve this hybrid world as long as it's hybrid for? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : We are thoughtfully looking at it. I mean we are increasingly working with partners like, for example our partnership from SAP or Pivotal, VMware, these are all on hybrid cloud solutions. And so we are thinking about how to do that better. and our overall approach to cloud hybrid modernization I think is the right long-term direction and so we are doing that. And there are many, many situations we are in where on-prem is a big, big, big requirement for customers, but with our partnership approach, we've been able to address the needs well. So, I don't see that as a gating issue for us. Heather Bellini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Thanks. Ruth, I just wanted to see if you could quantify the FX headwind. I think it was a negative 1% for Q3 and in Q4, do you anticipate it to be similar or a little worse? Ruth Porat : I will let you forecast the dollar. As you noted, it was 1 point here. We went from a tailwind in the second quarter to a 1 point drag here going forward. But we called out that and we'll have more in the Q, but noted the impact, for example, a pretty big delta between our reported and fixed and other Americas, 19% to 28% growth and that was really what was going on with the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso. We saw some movements in other currencies around the globe, but you can see that, which is why we broke out the geography the way we've done it a number of quarters ago to try and give you, help give a better sense of the types of headwinds and I'll let you forecast the dollar. Brent Thill : Okay, we look forward to that. Real quick just on EMEA, you were flat on your constant currency growth, 19%, 19% the last two quarters despite with GDPR. So, I would believe that would suggest that you're probably not seeing as big a headwind perhaps as maybe some expect. Could you just talk to the European business and what you're seeing there? Sundar Pichai : Look, I mean specifically, I think if your question is around GDPR and so on, first of all, I mean we've always been as a company very, very focused on user privacy and security. And so in some ways we were very early on, engaged on GDPR and we worked very hard to make sure our products are ready in in compliance. We've generally always approached our products with a strong privacy lens for our users. So, and I think that helps us work through these changes, because I don't think they are at odds with what we are trying to accomplish. I think GDPR is a very good and comprehensive set of regulations. And so I think it's been good to see a smooth transition on our products and for our users. Ruth Porat : We're continuing to invest significantly in Europe, because we see the opportunity across Europe and are investing in the communities in which we're working. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Great, thank you. One quick one for Ruth. People are really asking about Amazon. Just wondering if your e-commerce vertical was any difference versus your other verticals in the quarter. Anything to call out there? And then secondly, Sundar, a lot of interesting things going on with YouTube and Waymo and cloud and other areas. As you look out two or three years, do you think any of these businesses could really make a financial positive difference on the bottom line for overall Google? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Look, I mean, I think on the first thing on e-commerce, maybe really in people, we do see a lot of activity in the vertical on our products, and we see strong growth there as well. We see is an important use case and that's why we are investing a lot. And if you look at our recent work with Shopping Actions, that's an example of the kind of work we are doing there. And when we do those things, we clearly see users respond. Like for example, on Shopping Actions I think we just recently had partnerships with Best Buy and Nike and Sephora, I mentioned it earlier. So we are continuing to invest there and we are also driving strong partnerships with the retail sector, both in terms of our shopping experiences as well as through cloud. And I think that continues to be a big opportunity. And on your broader question, look, the reason we are investing across Google and Alphabet in a set of areas is because as a company over the past 20 years, we have developed deep capabilities in technology, in computer science and especially with machine learning and AI. And we see an opportunity to apply that across a set of important areas. There are a lot of opportunities ahead of us. We are pretty disciplined about where we focus on and we're focused on real large opportunities. And when you mention areas like YouTube and Waymo and cloud and hardware, they all fit the category. But we take a very long-term view. And we want to investigate the user experience right. And we're pretty confident that when we do that, the value will follow. Justin Post : Thank you, Sundar. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for closing remarks. Ellen West : Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ellen West : \u2026 fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business performance and operations and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations Web site located at abc.xyz/investor. And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Ellen. We have a strong 2018, with total revenues of $136.8 billion, up 23% over 2017, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing investments to deliver exceptional experiences for users and compelling returns for our advertisers, partners and enterprise customers. For the fourth quarter, revenues of $39.3 billion or up 22% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency, as we continue to benefit from ongoing strength in mobile search with important contributions from YouTube, Cloud and Desktop Search. For today's call, I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google followed by Other Bets, and will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights after which we will take your questions. Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter : our total revenues of $39.3 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $724 million or $600 million after the impact of our hedging program. Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, you can see that our performance was strong again in all regions : U.S. revenues were $18.7 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $12.4 billion, up 20% year-over-year in both reported and constant currency terms with a slight headwind primarily from the euro. APAC revenues were $6.1 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 32% in constant currency, reflecting weakness of the Australian dollar. Other Americas revenues were $2.2 billion, up 16% year-over-year and up 26% in constant currency, reflecting weakening of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $17.9 billion, up 26% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.5 billion, up 34% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were : first, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, mostly for our advertising supported content in what is a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube, but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV which have higher CAC as a percentage of revenues. Second, costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation and, third, hardware related costs for our made by Google and Nest family of products. Operating expenses were $13.2 billion, up 27% year-over-year. The biggest increase was in R&D expenses, with the larger driver being headcount growth, followed by the accrual of compensation expenses to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets. Growth in Sales and marketing expenses reflect increases in sales and marketing headcount primarily for Cloud and Ads followed by advertising investments mainly in Search and the Assistant. The growth in G&A expenses reflects mostly increases in headcount. Stock-based compensation totaled $2.3 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 98,771, up 4,399 from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count increases were in Cloud for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $8.2 billion, up 7% versus last year for an operating margin of 21%. Other income and expense was $1.9 billion, which includes $1.3 billion of unrealized gain related to a non-marketable debt security investment. We provide more detail on these line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 11.2% for the fourth quarter, reflecting a discrete benefit due to the reversal of an accrual made as a result of updated guidance associated with the U.S Tax Act. Net income was $8.9 billion and earnings per diluted share were $12.77. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $7.1 billion, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $13 billion with free cash flow of $5.9 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $109 billion. Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $39.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $27 billion in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search. Network revenues were $5.6 billion, up 12% year-on-year reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and Google Ad Manager. Other revenues for Google were $6.5 billion, up 31% year-over-year fueled by Cloud, Hardware and Play. We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. Total traffic acquisition costs were $7.4 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 15% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down year-over-year, primarily reflecting a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites' TAC rate year-over-year was driven by the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC, followed by changes in partner agreements offset by the seasonally higher proportion of YouTube advertising revenues in the fourth quarter. In Q4, the network TAC rate declined year-on-year, primarily due to our revenue mix shift within our programmatic business. Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.1 billion for the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Operating income was $9.7 billion, up 13% versus last year and the operating margin was 24.8%.Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $6.8 billion, reflecting investments in office facilities, datacenters, and servers. Let me now turn to and talk about Other Bets. I'll cover results for the full-year 2018 because it remains most instructive to look at the financials for Other Bets over a longer-term horizon, as we've discussed on prior calls. Results for the quarter are in our earnings release. For the full-year 2018, Other Bets revenues were $595 million, up 25% versus 2017 primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss for Other Bets was $3.4 billion for the full-year 2018 versus an operating loss of $2.7 billion in 2017. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $181 million, down from $493 million in 2017 primarily reflecting investments in Fiber. Key recent accomplishments include : in December, Waymo launched Waymo One, which enables participants to use its app to hail and pay for rides. Also Verily recently announced a $1 billion investment round led by Silver Lake as it advances on plans that are complementary and additive to its current life sciences portfolio. That investment of course was in addition to the $800 million it raised from Temasek previously. Let me close with some observations on our priorities and longer-term outlook. First, with respect to revenues. Our 23% revenue growth in 2018 was powered in particular by the ongoing benefit of innovation in our Sites business. With eight products, with more than 1 billion users each and more people coming online every day, we remain excited by the opportunities to continue to create valuable experiences for users around the globe. In particular, we see significant ongoing potential to apply our machine learning capabilities across our businesses. In our advertising business, machine learning has enabled innovation in advertisers ability to match consumer intent into bit more effectively for improved ROI. It has also enhanced the ability of smaller businesses to benefit from advertising on our platforms. Machine learning is also driving differentiation for newer Google businesses, like Cloud and Hardware, as well as central to a number of Other Bets, most notably Waymo and Verily. Looking ahead, a couple of things to note. First, as we\u2019ve said many times, we continuously work to enhance the user and advertiser experience because we make changes with a focus on the best interest of users and advertisers over the long-term, the timing of the introduction of new experiences, particularly, in search advertising can vary which can result in an impact on quarterly year-on-year growth. Second, during 2018, the FX tailwinds in the first half of the year turn to headwinds in the third and fourth quarters, in line with the strengthening of the U.S dollar. Based on the continuing strengthening of the U.S dollar, we expect a headwind to reported versus fixed FX results in the first quarter, in contrast to the favorable impact of FX in the first quarter of 2018. Turning to investments and profitability. In terms of gross margin, the biggest component within cost of revenues remains our traffic acquisition costs, reflecting our strong revenue growth in mobile search and the fact that mobile search carries higher TAC than our desktop business. As we've discussed on prior calls, while the pace of year-on-year growth in Sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues, slowed after the first quarter of 2018. We do expect the Sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search. Within OpEx, we remain focused on prioritization in order to optimize resources for longer-term growth in sizable markets. You'll see us continue to support our priority areas with increased headcount, which will remain concentrated in R&D. Although we expect the growth rate to moderate in 2019. In 2018, we also saw continued progress on our goal to nurture new businesses outside of Google, our Other Bets with a model of independence. While I've said previously that there is no monolithic approach to how the Other Bets execute against opportunities, a shared principle is aligning employee interest with the long-term value creation by these companies. Since inception, this has been an important part of our approach at Google with stock grants comprising a meaningful component of overall compensation across our employee days. We are increasingly following that approach in the Other Bets with compensation programs that align employee and company interests. You\u2019ve seen the impact of some of those programs in the fourth quarter as we accrued compensation expenses to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets. While these expenses will recur, the timing evaluation events is unpredictable and can vary between debts which can affect quarterly comparisons. Finally, on capital allocation. Our primary use continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions. After taking these needs into account, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 12.5 billion of our Class C capital stock. With respect to CapEx, we continue to invest in both compute requirements and for office facilities. Although we expect the CapEx growth rate in 2019 to moderate quite significantly. In conclusion, 2018 was another great year, with tremendous ongoing opportunity ahead of us. I will now turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Ruth. Last year, we set out to bring the benefits of AI to everyone through our products. And I'm proud of the tremendous progress we made towards that goal. From smart compose and Gmail to the new Google news experience, to call screening on the pixel and improving the overall safety of our products. AI's helping people get things done every day. Beyond our products, AI is also helping us drive our mission forward at the scale we couldn\u2019t have imagined just a few years ago. Google Al Lead, Jeff Dean recapped the results of our efforts in a great post on our AI block. Accusing AI to better deduct the spread of breast cancer, or providing flood victims, with real-time information in a crisis. I encourage everyone to check it out. We also launched the Google AI impact challenge to help nonprofits find ways to use AI to solve social and environmental problems. In addition to our progress in AI we saw great traction across newer areas, like the Google assistant, hardware, and Cloud. And our core area such as search maps new use YouTube under computing and advertising platforms continue their strong momentum. Everything we do at Google is united by the mission of making information accessible and useful for everyone. Providing accurate and trusted information at the scale the internet has reached is an extremely complex challenge. And one that is constantly getting harder. But we\u2019ve 20 years of experience in these information challenges, and it's what we strive to do better than anyone else. As we do this, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to do the right thing and are continuing to build privacy and security into the core of our products, keeping uses data safe and secure with the industry's best security systems and giving people better and clearer controls. You will see us continue to do a lot more here in 2019. Today I will start by sharing some of the new ways that we are working towards our mission. Then I will give an update on our video and advertising platforms, followed by the latest on our hardware and cloud efforts. And I will close with a few thoughts on our investments around the world. First, advancing our mission of making information accessible and useful. The Google assistant is a great example of how we help people throughout the day and we demonstrated that at CES last month with lots of exciting new partners and features. From the Lenovo Smart Clock that wakes you up in the morning to real-time navigation that helps during your commute. To a build in interpreter that translates conversations across dozens of languages on Google home. And speaking of languages, over the past year the Google assistant expanded from eight languages and 14 countries to nearly 30 languages and 80 countries. In that time, the number of active users us quadruple. As we had more partners, devices and capabilities, the Google assistant will only get better and more helpful. There's a lot of great progress in other areas too. Last month, we announced the launch of activity cards and search. Now when you search for a topic that you\u2019ve previously explode, you can quickly see very of already being and pick up where you left off. Thanks to our strengths in AI and Search, Google Lens uses your smartphone camera to help identify more than 1 billion products. So if you see an item that you like, Lens can show you similar designs, along with useful information like product reviews. We continue to see great momentum across our computing platforms, android and chrome. In Q4, we announced that android was officially support affordable phones that partners like Samson introducing their first portable devices this year. We see continued traction with manufacturer adoption of android auto. We recently announced new media and messaging features to significantly simplify and improve the car dashboard experience. And building on the speed simplicity and security of chrome OS, partners like Asus and HP, introduced a slew of great consumer and enterprise Chromebooks last months at CES. Now let me provide an update on our video and advertising platforms, starting with YouTube. We are seeing great traction in some of our newer experiences on YouTube. YouTube music and YouTube Premium are now available in nearly 30 countries up from five countries at the start of 2018. Last month, YouTube TV announced that it is expanded nationwide to cover 98% of U.S households with the rest to follow shortly. YouTube continues to invest in its thriving community of creators and build great features for its nearly 2 billion monthly log in users. For instance in Q4, the expanded access to tools like stories and community polls that strengthen the connections between France and creators. One of our newest tools, Premiers, is a breakout hit. Ariana Grande's premiere of her official music video for Thank U, Next in November holds the record for biggest music video debut in YouTube history earning over $55 million views in its first day. We are driving revenue to the YouTube creator community from established channels to newly emerging ones. The number of YouTube channels with more than 1 million subscribers nearly doubled in the last year, and the number of creators earning five or six figures grew by more than 40% year-over-year. A big priority for YouTube in 2019 is to continue our work to quickly find and remove content that violates YouTube's content guidelines. It's an important challenge and with advanced machine learning and investments in human reviewers, we are making continued progress. Now I'll touch on some of the recent highlights of our advertising business, which continue to go from strength to strength. Recently, Warner Brothers embedded the first full-length film with an ad on YouTube and reached a record number of people. Over 17 million users in a single day. Viewers who watch the trailer for LEGO Movie 2 on Black Friday, were served the franchise's original film for free within the Ad. So great example of how advertisers continue to delight users on YouTube. Performance advertisers love TrueView for action. YouTube's direct response offering. Since the product launch in March 2018 over 30% of the advertisers who use TrueView for action were new to buying inc and video ads on YouTube. In Q4, we also announced a global strategic ad tech relationship with The Walt Disney Company across their entire portfolio of brands and properties. With Google Ad Manager as its core platform, Disney will be able to serve across its digital property seamlessly. On the web and mobile apps through connected TVs and even during live events. Our shopping tools, that are also front and center during the holidays, helping retailers reach people during the busy holiday shopping season. In fact, the number of shopping daily active users on Google.com during the holidays, double compared to last year. Thanks and part to new features like product list modules that showcase the most popular products across the web. Small retailers are also benefiting from automated bidding solutions like smart shopping campaigns, which now has more than 20,000 live merchants. Impressive progress since launching in April. Now on to our growing hardware efforts. During the holiday season, our newest line up of made by Google Devices top many best of 2018 looks. The response from shoppers was equally positive. It was another record year for our Google home family of devices, with million sold this holiday season. They\u2019re helping people easily get things done around the house. For example, people use Google home devices to cook over 16 million recipes this holiday season. 1 million on Christmas Day alone. Our newest smart displays were particularly popular. One out of every seven Google home devices activated or the holiday season was a Google home hub. In Q4, we launched significant advances in computational photography in our pixel three with features such as night sight for lowlight photos. We\u2019ve also expanded availability to four more countries : Japan, France, Ireland, and Taiwan. And finally, our growing cloud business. I want to thank Diane Greene for her leadership over the last three years. Google Cloud is a fast-growing multibillion-dollar business that supports major global 5,000 companies in every important vertical with a robust enterprise organization. This was not the case just three years ago. What Diane and their team accomplished, it's phenomenal. Now Diane's work is done and she has handed the reins to Thomas Kurian, and I\u2019m thrilled to have him here as our new Cloud leader. Google Cloud closed out the strong year, with momentum across the business. Last year, we more than doubled both the number of Google Cloud platform deals over $1 million as well as the number of multiyear contracts signed. We also ended the year with another milestone, passing 5 million paying customers for our cloud collaboration and productivity solution G suite. Our focus on helping customers digitally transform their businesses is paying off. We continue to see strong growth in all our major geographies and industries this quarter. In financial services, we signed agreements with two of the top financial institutions in the U.S to help them transition their business to Google Cloud with our highly secured solutions. In retail, brands like Bed Bath & Beyond, DSW and Ulta Beauty are using our cloud to manage data and provide more personalized experiences to consumer. In Media and Entertainment, the telegraph and the U.K's going all in with Google Cloud because of our data and machine learning expertise. To support our global growth, in Q4, we launched our 18th Google cloud region and announced plans for a new region in Jakarta. So as you can see we are investing in the many incredible opportunities across our business. We would also investing in communities around the world and right here at home. I was recently in Europe opening up our new office in Berlin, which will help us more than doubled the number of Googlers who work there. Across Europe, we've invested more than \u20ac4.3 billion in five data centers since 2007. And in Q4, we announced a new data center coming in Denmark. In all, it's estimated that these data centers have generated more than \u20ac5.4 billion in GDP over the last ticket. Of course the amount generated by our creator, publisher and app developer partners across the region is orders of magnitude larger. We also continue our substantial investments throughout the U.S. Last year, we made significant investments in new and expanded office space. In Q4, we open the doors to our new office in Detroit and announced that we will be investing over $1 billion in capital improvements to establish a new campus in New York City, which will begin to open in 2020. We are also continuing to invest in data center construction and expansion. There is an important long-term investment that lay the groundwork for our future computing needs primarily to x-rayed machine learning across our businesses. But also to support the opportunities we see in cloud, search, ads and YouTube. More than 20 years in there is still tremendous opportunity for Google to help people save time, learn new things, grow their businesses and build stronger communities. I want thank every Googler around the world for making 2018, a great year for users and our business. With that I'll hand it back over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan : Thank you so much for taking the question. Two, if I could. On YouTube, you never have a number of brands in the marketplace between YouTube Premium, TV, YouTube Music. How are you thinking about positioning those brands against a global opportunity, especially in mobile to consume media on a global scale and how you\u2019re positioning those brands for the opportunity. And then, Ruth, I wanted to come back to comment on revenue versus extends with respect to YouTube. It sounds like called out YouTube as strong in the quarter on the revenue side, but is depressed on the expense side. Was that because of licensed content for things like Music and YouTube TV, or what is ad splits? How should we think about what the drivers were there and how they\u2019re now permanent versus seasonal in Q4. Thank you so much. Sundar Pichai : Thanks Eric. On the YouTube question, of course, our core effort is around the main YouTube product and that is what works at scale globally across the world and we are seeing continued engagement and it's doing very well. We are committed to making sure there's a premium experience on YouTube, delivering the content people would want and YouTube Music is an important part of that as well. So we're investing in both. As you know YouTube TV is U.S only and we are definitely -- it's an exciting product. It's differentiated and has long run value for us because it brings our advertising products together including being able to serve it across TV. So we are clearly investing in areas where we see opportunity. We are pretty thorough about making sure our investments deliver growth on the other side. And so we monitored with metrics and beat engagement and revenue growth and we see a lot of opportunity here. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of revenue it's an investment in YouTube, overall, as Sundar said, we are --YouTube is continuing to benefit from the secular change the way users are consuming content and that's reflected in strong revenue growth. Brand advertising does remain the largest part of the business. It's growing at a strong pace and as I said in opening comments, we're particularly excited about the significant growth in direct response both TrueView for action and app promo formats are delivering a great value for users and advertisers, and that's driving growth across regions and channels. In terms of the expenses, I think what you're referring to is within other cost revenues. The primary driver in the fourth quarter was the increase in content acquisition costs due to YouTube growth and that's both for ad supported content and what is typically a seasonally strong quarter. And also for our newer subscription businesses, which do have higher TAC as a percentage of revenue we're excited about the growth we're seeing here. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore. Your line is now open. Anthony DiClemente : Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. One for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, if I look at the segment operating losses for Other Bets, they were higher both in the fourth quarter and for the year '18 over '17. Is it safe to assume that investments at Waymo or can you just flush out a little bit more for us if possible, were there other Other Bets besides Waymo, which were worthy of call out in terms of greater or decreasing investment. That will be great? And then for, Sundar, I\u2019m just wondering if you could provide us any commentary about how good the Cloud is going? Any milestones? You talked about the investment there. Ruth did, I think, in terms of headcount growth in technical and sales roles and for the new leadership that you mentioned what is the things that the new -- that Thomas Kurian can kind of do Cloud to accelerate the next phase of growth in that business. Thank you so much. Ruth Porat : So in terms of the investment levels in Other Bets, the major point is that we are investing across Other Bets commencement with what we think is required kind of looking out at the opportunity set for each one. And we go through a regular process with weekly business reviews and quarterly board reviews and try and calibrate the appropriate pace of investment. In terms of the increase this quarter, as I indicated in opening comments, we accrued some comp expenses for a number of bets and that was really to reflect increases in the valuation of equity in certain Other Bets. Sundar Pichai : On Cloud, one of the things that was evident towards the end of last year is now our inability to win in a very large customers global 5,000 companies with multiyear contracts. And so that's definitely something we want to focus on. I think Dyne and Thomas have been working closely on a transition with a lot of continuity, and you'll continue to see us. It's very clear to us that our product offerings are ready and differentiated and so we want to invest and scale our go-to-market both in terms of direct sales and our channel partnerships. And maybe you will see us focus more on areas where we\u2019re clearly seeing returns. Be the geographic regions we care about the six main verticals where most of the momentum is. And within product offerings, the five major areas where we\u2019ve clearly defined product with differentiated features to. But I\u2019m excited at the traction we are seeing, we are getting large wins and I look forward to executing here. Eric Sheridan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Douglas Anmuth : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask to, first, can you think about the strong Google Sites growth 23%, that\u2019s actually neutral. Can you just help us understand some of the mobile search innovations that you think are really driving things here beyond some of these underlying secular strength, with the particular focus perhaps on the retail channel, and just how you\u2019re thinking about the opportunity there? And then, second, Ruth, just wanted to go back to your comment on OpEx. Just wanted to clarify, were you saying that headcount growth, specifically you think will moderate in '19 or are you talking about overall OpEx spending? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Doug, on the first one, obviously we have thousands of engineers working on continually launching search improvements. I think for me a lot of this has been the clear hard work that's gone into making sure search on mobile works really, really well removing friction where we can constantly working to get the answers, a bit quicker and faster and make -- making the more relevant. So to me it's more a set of a continual innovation mentality that we\u2019ve had there for a long time. And that\u2019s really working at scale. Ruth Porat : And then the specific comment I think you\u2019re referencing is I was pointing to headcount growth. We are continuing to hire to support growth opportunities, particularly hiring engineers and product managers in Google and continuing to support growth in Cloud, and what I was just trying to draw out was we will continue to hire, but the year-on-year growth rate will moderate there. Douglas Anmuth : Okay. Thank you, both. Operator : Thank you. And then next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you. Yes, I had a follow-up on to Anthony's questions on cloud. It doesn\u2019t seem like you want to share an update on the revenue run rate. But I was wondering if maybe you can share with us what you\u2019re seeing in terms of year-over-year growth rate, and in particular are they growing faster than what the competitors disclosed in their public results? Because maybe they will help think about the pace of growth in your Cloud business. And then, secondarily I was just wondering if you can give us a sense of the types of workloads, if there's any commonality to the types of workloads, you might be running work frequently than not. Thank you. Ruth Porat : So, in terms of growth, Cloud does continue to deliver sizable revenue growth driven by GCP and GCP does remain one of the fastest-growing businesses across Alphabet. As Sundar said, we double the number of GCT contracts greater than a 1 million. We are also seeing a really nice uptick in the number of deals that are greater than $100 million and really pleased with the success and penetration there. At this point, not updating further. Sundar Pichai : Heather, I think maybe specifically a couple of examples, there's definitely we see clear strength in data management and analytics, so we can take specs -- for example, in retail or if you take someone like the Telegraph, those very important factors. Application platforms, so our ability to help customers, deploy cloud native applications has been a differentiator for customers like Unity, Ubisoft, etcetera. And Multi Cloud, ability to run cloud services across Clouds on Prem. In terms out to be very important for global multinational companies like HSBC. So we do see a wide variety of stuff. We are clearly focused on infrastructure being an application platform, data management and smart analytics, and of course with G suite productivity and collaboration. So that's the core areas we are investing in from a product and a go-to-market standpoint. And we are seeing great traction there. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking mu questions. I have two. Just the first one to go back to YouTube in a very strong quarter. It sounds like on branded advertising and now some of these new direct response ads. I was curious, Sundar, as you think about with an innovation focus, what do you see as being one or two of the biggest opportunities to further improve the quality or the efficacy of the ad product, you provide for advertisers on YouTube from here. And then Waymo, got a couple of milestones. But the last 3 to 6 months, maybe talk us through how you see the next one or two big factors that you're really focused on ensuring that Waymo becomes what it could be? Sundar Pichai : On YouTube, I still think we are in early days of making sure YouTube is better platform for direct response and TrueView for action is still early. We see great traction, but I think there's a lot more to do and I think we had a set of features which we launched last year to make sure it works better. But I think there's a lot more to do. In the long run, I think for me, YouTube is a place where we see users not only come for entertainment, they come to find information, they\u2019re coming to learn about things. They\u2019re coming to discover, to research and so being able to match that intent over time in a way that we can bring the right value for our users and advertisers. I think there's a long run opportunity. And we're taking all the right foundational steps to realize it. Ruth Porat : And in terms of Waymo, as you know well, we are intently focused on safety first and ensuring a great user experience, and that's why we're expanding methodically. We are pleased that we\u2019ve continued to broaden out our service in the Phoenix area and we're focused on expanding both the number of riders in the geographic reach around Phoenix. In addition, we're having conversations with a number of other interested cities and we are continuing to explore applying our technology for logistics and deliveries and for personal use vehicles and for last mile solutions for cities, so continuing to execute as we\u2019ve described previously. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. Two questions. First, Ruth, could you just provide a little more color on the R&D expense build up. Anything unusual on there? Just comment on the cadence of that? Then, Sundar, on hardware that\u2019s -- it's been a multiyear effort. It seems like it's accelerated. There's a series of these new products we try to do a report on to make sure we understood them. Could you talk about how the strategic and maybe the synergistic impacts that you're seeing of hardware on the rest of Google's business, on the rest of Alphabet's business, and do you think that it's still early days and maybe paint a picture of how significant those synergies could be? Thank you very much. Ruth Porat : So starting with R&D, the main driver is our ongoing investment in engineers, in particular, in Google and then as I said the sizable increase in accrued comp for Other Bets and just build that out a bit more, give you a bit more color, in certain Other Bets, employees are compensated through equity-based programs. And that's because we believe that this alignment of interest is valuable. We do assess valuation on an ongoing basis. And at a minimum, we do a formal valuation assessment once every 12 months or when there is a significant event. And what you're seeing in the fourth quarter is the impact of higher valuation in certain Other Bets. And as we've talked about previously, a goal with the Alphabet structure is to enable us to build new businesses that would make a positive impact and create long-term value. And it's still early days we're very excited about the opportunities we see. And so what you're seeing is the impact here of valuation. The way we approach it is very consistent with the way startups are typically valued, and that includes technical progress and a range of other items. Sundar Pichai : And Mark, on hardware, obviously, we are working hard to offer the best Google experience we can bringing together AI software and hardware. And you are right that it does have a lot of synergistic value, but at the stage where we\u2019re in. The main way we do that today for our core products is by using hardware to drive where the rest of the computing ecosystem is. And so we get a very leveraged effect there. But over time, as we scale up our hardware efforts and do it thoughtfully, so it definitely -- when I look at the kind of experience we can deliver. For example, if you look at something like the Google Home Hub and how it delivers a nice experience across Search, Assistant and YouTube and Photos when you wanted, you can definitely see the glimpse of the future. And so, we are investing to realize that. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Stephen Ju : Okay. Sundar, just picking up on the AI for everyone theme, you\u2019ve been highlighting at I/O as well as other venues. Are conversations with advertisers suggest that products like smart bidding are becoming a pretty -- increasingly popular tool to add to their bidding strategies. But how has the pickup been among the SMBs, especially among the local advertisers? Do you think you can target that market without a sales force? And secondarily, as we talk of two companies transitioning to a Cloud, there's increased talk of collecting data, dealing with data lakes as well as analyzing all that data to help their decision-making process. So from your standpoint running Google, do you feel like the current technology you have at your disposal is sophisticated enough to keep up with all of the needs for you to run the company as you collect all the data from across the internet? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : I think two questions. On your first question around using machine learning to help serve advertisers better and be able to reach newer advertisers, SMBs and local advertisers. I definitely think you highlight an exciting opportunity. Whenever we\u2019ve done work like be it last year or the last couple of years through universal app campaigns or smart shopping campaigns last year, responsive search ads, those are all great examples of where we brought ML. And with that, we made process much easier for advertisers of all sizes and we see an impact. So I think it's a natural extension for us to continue working in that direction, and that will help us reach SMBs and local advertisers better over time. So I do think that's a good opportunity. And on the second part of your question, I want to make sure I understand it. If you\u2019re asking about how we invest in our security as a company, I think it's the foundation of how we do everything for the past 20 years. And we always -- we realize a deep responsibility that coming -- that comes with being stewards of users' data. So everything we design is designed with privacy and security in mind. It's where some of our core investments go, be it securing our data centers, literally the practices we have across the company, the quality and talent in our security teams and over time using AI itself to do all this well. So it's a core part of what we do and we take it very, very seriously. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Daniel Salmon : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, in your review of some of the shopping products during the fourth quarter, you didn't mention shopping actions. And there were reports there that Walmart decided to leave the program recently and I think there have been some public comments on social media from Googlers confirming that. So I would just love to hear a little bit more about that. But maybe more broadly the traction of shopping actions and, in particular, the price per sale metric that you rolled out with it during the holiday season. And then, Ruth, just a quick one for you, if we could return to your prepared remarks, there were a couple of sort of things to keep in mind that you\u2019re highlighting. One was FX going from a tailwind to a headwind, but just before that you were talking about how new experiences can rollout over time to users. And I just wanted to clarify, were you referencing an experience that\u2019s rolling out currently, or just generally that that is a best practice in general for Google? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : On shopping, I think we launched shopping actions around, if I remember, March of last year. And we've definitely seen a strong traction there. I think we've seen roughly a sevenfold increase in merchants in the program since we launched it. And just in Q4, we announced new partnerships with Best Buy, Nike, Sephora as an example. And in terms of Walmart, we have -- Walmart is one of our deepest partners and they remain a strategy partner across multiple businesses for us, including Google Ads and we have efforts underway to work closer together with shopping. But they are definitely a large partner who continue experimenting and we will support them in many ways. But I think, overall, I\u2019m excited about the efforts we are doing in shopping and you will see us focus more there on 2019. We see users come to Google a lot around key shopping moments and we want to make sure we invest in the experience to get closer to what they want. Ruth Porat : And then on the second question, we've talked about this on prior calls. We've often talked about the fact that we have been and remain committed to long-term revenue growth through innovation. And the point I was trying to underscore is the timing and scale of the impact. It's inherently difficult to predict. And so it can be inconsistent from quarter-to-quarter. The main point is we remain very excited about the opportunities for users and advertisers, in particular, building off of Sundar's comment as we apply machine learning to solutions. Daniel Salmon : Great. Thank you, both. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Colin Sebastian : Great. Thank you. Two quick ones for me. First on Project Stream and YouTube TV. Just wondering how important it will be to invest in original content as well as how you might view the rollout of 5G as catalyzing consumer adoption of these services? And then on the Discover feed, I know that\u2019s still pretty new, but curious if you have any color on usage and engagement to date? And if there's any way you expect to monetize that feed in the near future? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On Project Stream, being able to deliver gaming with the kind of real-time requirements, the low latency requirements, it's definitely for us -- it's an important computing advance. We think it will help us drive the newer computing platforms we're working on. And I do think, services like that will be a point of inflection as 5G rolls out as well. So I think it is a virtuous cycle. So we are excited. The early feedback our Project Stream experience has been super positive. And so we are looking to build up on that and you will see us do more there in 2019. On Discover, I think traction has been for us, we measure user engagement and satisfaction and happiness on these -- on anything new we do, and the metrics have been really strong. And we obviously -- we offer the best experience today on our products like Pixel, made by Google products. And we are looking to scale that up to reach more users. But we think we\u2019ve a strong product there and I think it's very synergistic to search experience. And so we are looking to bring the best of both to our users, and you'll see us reach more users in 2019. Colin Sebastian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. A couple of questions. First, it looks like Google core margins were down about 3 points and what was an easier comp. So just wondering if you can give us any thoughts on how the core advertising business is doing in there? We know there's a lot of investment in Cloud and hardware and YouTube TV, but just would like to get a update on the health of the advertising business margins. And any thoughts on if you ever do segment disclosure. And then the second question is just on the Cloud strategy. There's been a pretty big leadership change. Just wondering if there's any new strategies or new things you will be doing this year with the Cloud related to the management change? And look forward to the Cloud Conference in April. Thank you. Ruth Porat : Thanks. So, in terms of overall Google margins, I think that the main point you're seeing in the margins as we continue to see tremendous opportunity across Google, and so we're investing to support long-term revenue and earnings growth. We\u2019ve talked a lot in this call already about the importance of machine learning and it is a key component of incremental investment, particularly, in CapEx for technical infrastructure to support the existing -- at the existing businesses, but also the newer ones, and that's kind of flowing through here. We've talked on prior calls that we're very mindful of the fact that CapEx turns into depreciation, which is why I single this out. We are continuing to see tremendous opportunity in the ads business, Search and Ads businesses and beyond machine learning we're further investing to continue to enhance the experience for users and advertisers, and that's across Mobile Desktop and YouTube. So, for example, a big priority in 2018 was expanding the availability of content for what we call the next billion user markets, which are for us a really important area. We are excited about the growth and the opportunity to deliver experiences across markets. We are also investing to enable more visual ways of finding information, such as photos and videos. And then, we are investing aggressively in our newer businesses within Google, particularly, Cloud and Hardware as Sunder has already said. So what you're seeing reflected through in the margins on the cost of revenue side is the impact of the product mix that we\u2019ve talked about, a big part of that is the ongoing strength in YouTube and then on the OpEx side investing in engineers, in particular, for Google as well as on the sales and marketing side, the increased headcount to support not just Ads, but in particular Cloud. Sundar Pichai : And on the second question on Cloud, I answered it around Anthony and Heather's question, but to add a little bit more color, while -- maybe it's the change in leadership, but it was a well planned transition. And so Diane and Thomas together planned 2019. And the big things you\u2019re going to see are, a continued focus on global 5000 companies. We are definitely seeing traction with large multiyear contracts, multimillion dollar contracts there. So you'll see us focused there. We will continue to invest in and expand our sales and distribution channels to meet customer demand, so that's going to be an important area for 2019. But mostly being highly focused on the 15 countries, 6 industries and the 5 major solution areas that we think will have the most impact and directing most of our resources towards those efforts is probably something you will see continued emphasis in 2019. Justin Post : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is now open. Ross Sandler : Great. Two questions. First, there's a lot of discussion right now about alternatives to Google Play and Apple's App Store for distribution. And some of the large developers are starting to come up with these workarounds around the App Store fees. So, I guess, just philosophically, how do you think about the 30%? Do you think that\u2019s the right long-term rate for Google Play? And then, Ruth, coming back to the headcount and CapEx growth moderating comments, so you have expenses growing well in excess of revenue for some time in the core Google segment, and 2018 was the lowest operating income growth since you started disclosing the segments. So are you just flagging this as a change of direction? Is this a material change or is this just a small amount of moderation in 2019? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On Google Play, obviously, we do this at scale, thousands of developers rely on it to safely and seamlessly distribute their game to billions of android users worldwide. And we invest a lot in our infrastructure to continuously make sure their overall experience is safe and results in high engagement and for the developer's back. So I think there's a value exchange there and it's been the industry standard. And so, I think we will continue down that path and -- but obviously always adapt to where the market is. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of the pace of investments, I\u2019ve already laid out the focus areas and our commitment to continue to invest to support long-term revenue and earnings growth and just wanted to put a fine point on both CapEx and headcount. So on CapEx, as I indicated in opening remarks, we do expect the rate of year-on-year CapEx growth will slow meaningfully. So with the scale of our business and with our focus on user experience, it does require CapEx. We are committed to continue to invest in CapEx to deliver on that. In terms of the mix, we expect to see more of an uptick in 2019 in data center investments relative to servers. But the point which you asked in your question, the year-on-year growth rate will moderate meaningfully. And then, in terms of headcount, we are -- I was just trying to make clear that the growth in headcount will moderate somewhat here just so that there's no interpolation. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Thanks. For Sundar, the cash position has doubled the last five years to $109 billion. Yet in the last four years M&A has been right around $3 billion, which is well below your peers. And I\u2019m just curious that it seems like the core is very strong, but is there hesitation that you\u2019re seeing in terms of valuation or other factors that are playing into that relative to what your peers are doing right now? Sundar Pichai : I think, we\u2019ve always approached M&A as I think really -- we are always evaluating opportunities. We\u2019ve a very high bar, and so to me it's been more about us finding the right fit rather than being constrained by anything in particular. But I do think it's always an important part of our strategy and we've done great acquisitions in the past. Things like YouTube and android were big acquisitions for us. And so we continue to look for opportunities ahead. Brent Thill : And real quick for Ruth, just the magnitude of spend, I think goes back to what probably investors were most surprised by. It sounds like from your perspective you don't really look at the margin structure as having any floor, you\u2019re just looking at this as, as you said there's tremendous long-term opportunity that you need to make these investments now. I think many are just trying to search for a framework in how you think about this investment cycle we are in right now? Ruth Porat : So the reason I started by laying out, I think, in response to the question on margins where we're investing and how we look at is, we are very focused on investing to support long-term revenue and earnings growth. We are very mindful of the CapEx impacts on free cash flow and earnings growth. And so we're trying to get it right, over investing, under investing neither of those works for long-term value creation, but we are very mindful of the pace here and trying to lay out work with more specificity, how we are looking at the opportunity set where -- and making trade-offs where we can. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for closing comments. Ellen West : Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2019 call. Thank you and have a good evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ellen West : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to Alphabet\u2019s first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now, I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business performance and operations, and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward-looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. And now, I will turn the call over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Ellen. In the first quarter, total revenues of $36.3 billion were up 17% year-on-year and up 19% in constant currency, following a strong 2018. Once again our results were driven by ongoing strength in mobile search, along with important contributions from YouTube, followed by Cloud. For today\u2019s call, I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets and we will include with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions. Let me start with a summary of Alphabet\u2019s consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $36.3 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $1.2 billion or $1 billion after the impact of our hedging program. With respect to Alphabet revenues by geography, U.S. revenues were $16.5 billion, up 17% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $11.8 billion, up 13% year-over-year and up 16% in constant currency, reflecting weakening of the euro and the British pound. APAC revenues were $6.1 billion, up 27% versus last year and up 31% in constant currency, reflecting primarily the weakness of the Australian dollar and the Indian rupee. Other Americas revenues were $1.9 billion, up 10% year-over-year and up 21% in constant currency, reflecting primarily the weakening of the Brazilian real and Argentine peso. Turning to profitability, in our earnings press release, we provide a table to highlight the impact of the year European Commission fine on operating income, net income and EPS results in the first quarter. I will comment on resu lts both with and without the impact of the fine as I review the results. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment results, were $16 billion, up 19% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $9.2 billion, up 27% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google related expenses. The biggest contributor was costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher TAC as a percentage of revenues. Operating expenses including the impact of the EC fine were $13.7 billion. Excluding the impact of the fine, operating expenses were $12 billion, up 20% year-over-year. The biggest increase was in R&D expenses with headcount growth in Cloud as the largest driver. Growth in sales and marketing expenses primarily reflects additions to headcount. Growth in G&A expenses is primarily due to legal matters, including the effect of a legal settlement gain recorded in the first quarter of 2018. Stock-based compensation totaled $2.8 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 103,459 up 4,688 from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were in Cloud for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $6.6 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fine operating income was $8.3 billion, up 9% versus last year for an operating margin of 23%. Other income and expense was $1.5 billion. As I trust most of you are aware, in 2018 this line item was meaningfully elevated because of the introduction of a new accounting standard that requires recognition of unrealized gains and losses on equity securities. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 18.3% for the first quarter reflecting a sizable impact from the non-deductibility of the EC fine. Net income was $6.7 billion and earnings per diluted share were $9.50. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, net income was $8.3 billion and earnings per diluted share were $11.90. Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $4.6 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $12 billion, with free cash flow of $7.4 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $113 billion. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $36.2 billion, up 17% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $25.7 billion in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth results were led again by mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube, followed by desktop search. Network revenues were $5 billion up 8% year-on-year, continuing to reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth AdMob followed by Google Ad Manager. Other revenues for Google were $5.4 billion, up 25% year-over-year fueled by Cloud and Play and partially offset by hardware. Google Cloud Platform remains one of the fastest growing businesses in Alphabet with strong customer momentum reflected in particular in demand for our compute and data analytics products. Strong growth in Play was driven particularly by performance in APAC. Hardware results reflect lower year-on-year sales of Pixel, reflecting in part heavy promotional activity industry-wide, given some of the recent pressures in the premium smartphone market. We provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our Advertising businesses. Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.9 billion or 22% of total Advertising revenues and up 9% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total Advertising revenues was down year-over-year, reflecting a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites, as well as a decrease in the Network TAC rate. The Sites TAC rate was flat year-over-year, as the impact of the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC was offset by the growth in TAC free Sites revenue primarily from YouTube. In Q1, the Network TAC rate declined year-on-year primarily due to a favorable product mix shift. Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.6 billion for the quarter, up 13% year-over-year, operating income was $9.3 billion, up 11% versus last year and the operating margin was 25.8%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $4.5 billion, reflecting investments in data centers, servers and office facilities. Let me now turn to and talk about Other Bets. Revenues were $170 million primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $868 million. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $59 million. Key recent accomplishments include, Waymo recently announced that it will expand its activities in Michigan, opening a facility into Detroit that will be the first factory dedicated to the production of L4 autonomous vehicles. Last week, there were exciting announcements from two traditional Other Bets that were originally incubated within X. Loon announced a long-term strategic relationship to advance the use of high altitude vehicles to deliver connectivity, with SoftBank\u2019s telecoms group HAPSMobile, which will invest $125 million in Loon. Wing became the first drone delivery company to receive air carrier certification from the FAA, an important step toward beginning a commercial service delivering goods from local businesses to homes in the U.S. Let me close with some observations on our priorities and longer term outlook. As we highlighted on our last call, there was a significant swing year-over-year in the impact of currency movements on our results this quarter, from a big tailwind in the first quarter of 2018 to a headwind in 2019. These affect both revenues and operating income given the majority of our expenses are in the U.S. Based on the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to key currencies, we expect to continue to headwind to our revenues and operating income again in the second quarter. In terms of our key revenue drivers, with respect to Sites revenues, as we indicated last quarter, the timing of product changes in ads at times can have an impact on year-on-year growth rates. We will continue to make changes with a focus on the long-term best interest of users and advertisers. We remain confident about the sizable opportunity ahead to improve the advertiser and user experience through our ongoing commitment to product innovation, in particular by leveraging machine learning across our ads products and properties. Turning to the key drivers of growth and other revenues. We are pleased with the momentum of Google Cloud platform, with balanced growth of both new customers and expansion within existing customers driving revenue growth. With respect to hardware results, while the first quarter results reflect pressures in the premium smartphone industry, we are pleased with the ongoing momentum for Assistant-enabled Home devices, particularly the Home hub and Mini devices and look forward to our May 7th management at I/O from the hardware team. Turning to profitability, with regard to Google OpEx, the first quarter results once again reflect our ongoing commitment to investing for the long-term. You can see that in R&D where we continue to invest in technical talent for priority areas like Cloud, search and machine learning. In terms of sales and marketing, the pace of investment in Q1 reflected a timing shift in spend and we expect these expenses to pick up in the second quarter. In Other Bets OpEx, we are still early in the life of these companies and do plan to continue to invest meaningfully for the long-term opportunity. With respect to CapEx, the year-on-year decline reflects the purchase of a building in New York in the first quarter of 2018. As discussed on our call last quarter, while we anticipate that our full year CapEx investments will exceed those in 2018, the growth in investments should be at a meaningfully lower rate than in 2018. We continue to expect a sizable investment in both compute requirements to support long-term growth, as well as in office facilities. In conclusion, we feel confident about the opportunities ahead and we continue to invest thoughtfully for the long-term. I will now turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Ruth. It\u2019s great to be here with you all. Q1 was a very busy quarter at Google and it\u2019s only going to get busier. Later this week, we will host YouTube\u2019s upfronts events BrandCast followed by our Annual Developer Conference Google I/O next week and our advertising summit Google Marketing Live later in the month. You will hear a lot more from each of these teams throughout May, so I hope you can join us. We will always be a company that\u2019s focus on the long-term willing to make investments that will help our businesses and our customer\u2019s businesses succeed as technology continues to evolve. You saw this in the transition to mobile computing years ago and we are seeing that today in the shift to AI. We feel very positive about the enormous opportunities ahead involving search and assistant, capturing new ad budgets, cloud computing, AI and other areas. What gives us these opportunities as Google\u2019s position to help people, businesses and society in countless ways through our products. Today, I will start by talking about our core mission of making information universally accessible and useful, then I will provide an update on our computing video and advertising platforms, and finally, I will discuss our hardware and cloud efforts. First, an update in our mission to make information accessible and useful is helping people every day. A big focus for us is building products that are designed to help people in their day-to-day lives. Our Duplex technology within Google Assistant can now help you easily book a table at your favorite restaurant on all Android and iOS devices in 44 U.S. states. Just tell the Assistant where you want to go and when and it will do the rest. We have also began testing AI walking navigation in Google Maps, which uses augmented reality and give phone\u2019s camera to show you where you are relative to the surroundings as you are walking. Just last week, we announced an improved job search experience in the U.S., that helps people easily discover quality remote jobs, allowing them to work right from home. As part of our Google news initiative, we kicked off the local experiments project, working with local publishers to uncover new approaches to their business models and operations, so they can continue bringing great local content to the readers. AI is now spurring a new era of computing, which is more predictive and more assistive. We are committed to doing deep research and working to advance the space in a responsible way. AI is deeply embedded in our products, from Search to Photos to Google Home and we are also expanding other\u2019s ability to build on our advancements. Recently at TensorFlow\u2019s Annual Developer Summit, we announced TensorFlow 2.0, making it easier than ever to build an UCML through improvements like TensorFlow Privacy, which helps train models with differential privacy, meaning that users\u2019 data is better protected. Now on to our computing, video and advertising platforms. There\u2019s tremendous momentum across the Android ecosystem and our other computing platforms as we head into Google I/O. In the first quarter we released the beta of Android Q, which brings added privacy protections, new tools for developers to engage users and more. Android Go Edition, an optimized version of Android tailored for smartphones with one gig or less delivers a powerful fast and secure experience, specifically optimized for entry level smartphones. Today roughly 70% of entry level Android devices are now activating with Go like Samsung\u2019s J2 Core. We are seeing great momentum in Android Auto as well. At the Chicago Auto Show, Toyota announced that it will include Android Auto in upcoming vehicles starting in 2020. That means all of the top 10 carmakers now support Android Auto, and in Google Play, first-time buyers grew by nearly 50% year-over-year. I am very pleased with how these platforms are growing and creating amazing experiences for users, developers and partners. Our newest platform Stadia, which revolutionizes the way gamers access and play their favorite games and brings together the best of Google\u2019s infrastructure and open ecosystem approach. With Stadia, you will be able to play advanced AAA games on any type of screen instantly without ever needing to download the game or install updates. The reception from gamers in the industry has been incredible and we look forward to sharing more when it launches later this year. Next our video platform, YouTube. YouTube\u2019s top priority is responsibility. As one example, earlier this year YouTube announced changes that reduce recommendations of content that comes close to violating our guidelines or that misinforms in harmful ways. There are a lot more improvements, which we will be rolling out in the next few weeks and our work is ongoing. We have also expanded the content offering, availability and the functionality on some of our newer YouTube experiences. YouTube TV is now available nationwide with many new networks and channels added in Q1. YouTube Music and YouTube Premium are now available in 43 countries up from five markets at the start of 2018. In mid-March, we launched YouTube Music in India, one of YouTube\u2019s fastest growing markets. Since launch, the YouTube Music app has been downloaded more than 15 million times in the country. YouTube\u2019s Ad business, for both brand and direct response campaigns, continues to grow and support our creators. In Q1, we again saw how YouTube is the go-to destination for watching Super Bowl ads before, during and after the big game. This year viewership of Super Bowl ads on YouTube during the game grows by nearly 60%. More broadly, across our Ads business, our advertising product team led by Prabhakar continues to build new products for marketers, with more than 100 enhancements introduced every quarter. We do rigorous testing on each of these improvements to ensure that we are creating the best experience for users and advertisers. Our focus has always been on investing for the long-term rather than managing for results quarter-to-quarter. I feel really positive about the opportunities ahead and the innovations that we are bring to marketers, many of which are powered by machine learning. Philip on our business teams had done a great job helping advertisers take full advantage of these new capabilities. For instance, more than 70% of our advertisers are already using automated bit strategies and Google Ads and these MO powered technologies help customers get better results for their investments. In Q1, we began testing new shoppable ad units and Google Images so brands can highlight multiple products available for sale in sponsored image results. You have also seen us make it easy for people to buy products and take action when shopping on Google Assistant and search with a universal cart on mobile, desktop and Google Home devices. Since we launched these capabilities a year ago, the number of participating merchants has increased sevenfold. Lastly, at the Game Developers Conference, we introduce a host of the advertising solutions for developers, like app campaigns for engagement, which help developers reengage players with relevant ads across Google\u2019s properties. Next, I will give an update on our hardware and Cloud efforts. First hardware, I am very proud that in only a few short years, we have built a strong foundation in hardware. For example, demand for our Google Home family of products remain strong, especially the Home Mini and Home Hub. The breadth and depth of our product lines across Pixel, Nest and Home is amazing and you will see us continue to develop this incredible lineup. The team has also done a lot of work to scale our operations and we will continue to optimize our distribution, branding and points of business. We also announced the new campus and engineering hub in Taiwan, largely to support our hardware efforts. Not only our features like Night Sight in Pixel winning industry awards, but Net Promoter Scores tell us that many people who use our hardware products truly love them, which is particularly important as we move into this new era of computing. We are still early in our hardware journey and when I look ahead of the portfolio that we have created across Pixel Home and Nest, I feel really good about the range of products that we have. And finally, our growing Cloud business. Thomas has really hit the ground running. Just a few weeks ago, I was on stage with him at our Cloud Next event, where we hosted a sold-out crowd of more than 30,000 attendees. As I said at Next, moving to the Cloud should be simple and seamless. I was excited to announce and toss, which give customers a very elegant solution to both hybrid cloud and multi-cloud in a single technology stack. The early feedback from analysts, customers and partners has been a really great. We also announced innovations across many of our other products that enabled developers to build and deploy AI, help enterprises to better secure their data, allow Android users to leverage their phones as a security key and much more. We are also deeply committed to becoming the most customer-centric Cloud provider for enterprise customers and making it easier for companies to do business with us. Thanks to new contracting, pricing and more. Today nine of the world\u2019s 10 largest media companies, seven of the 10 largest retailers and more than half of the 10 largest companies and manufacturing, financial services, communications and software use Google Cloud. Some of the companies that we announced at Next included the American Cancer Society and Mekason in health care. Media and entertainment companies like USA Today and Viacom, consumer packaged goods brands like Unilever, manufacturing and industrial companies like Samsung and UPS, and public sector organizations like Australia Post. Finally to support our customer\u2019s growth, we also announced the addition of two new cloud regions in Seoul and Salt Lake City, which we plan to open in 2020. These new cloud regions will build on our current footprint of 19 cloud regions and 58 data centers around the world. 20 years in and over 100,000 employees strong, I am incredibly proud of the work that our teams at Google do every day. We have so many bright opportunities ahead and seizing those opportunities starts with their investment in the communities where we operate around the world and right here at home. In the U.S., not only are we expanding our workforce across the country, but we are helping people in every state, gain the digital skills they need to succeed in today\u2019s economy. In fact just one-year after kicking off our collaboration with Goodwill, 250,000 Americans have learned new digital skills and 27,000 have found a job. We also feel a deep responsibility to make sure that we -- that as we grow our business, we are doing it with minimal impact on the environment. Today, a Google data center uses 50% less energy than a typical data center, while delivering seven times more computing power than we did five years ago. Since 2017, we have matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with purchases of renewable energy and I am proud that Google is the world\u2019s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy. I have never been more excited about Google and where we are headed. I want to thank every Googler around the world for joining us on that journey. With that, I will hand it back over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a couple of parts on the revenue performance in the quarter. Ruth, you would called out potential volatility on the Q4 earnings call. I wanted to understand a little bit about what you are calling out in Q4 and how that might have manifest itself in Q1 on the product side of the equation, so we could just better understand how much of it was isolated to Q1 or it might be a headwind as we move through the year? And as you look at the individual performance of the ad divisions in sites, desktop, mobile search, YouTube, it seems like you were still calling out strength in mobile search in YouTube. So could it be desktop search where we actually saw some weakness in the quarter? Thanks so much for any granularity and color on that. Ruth Porat : Sure. Thanks Eric. So I will try to step back and start at the highest level. Obviously, on a reported GAAP basis revenue growth in Q1 reflects the FX headwind that we talked about in contrast to the tailwind last year and as you know well, we don\u2019t report sites revenues on a fixed FX basis, but the delta between fixed and floating growth rates the Alphabet level is a good proxy for the effect on sites revenue. Beyond that, I tried to draw that the year-on-year growth rate in part reflects our strong 2018. And then more to your question as we indicated last quarter, the other item is the timing of product changes in Ads can impact year-on-year growth rates and we make changes with the focus on the best interest of users and advertisers over the long-term we do not manage by quarter, so we are introducing enhancements only after product testing, and that was sort of the overarching color that I was trying to give you. And in terms of desktop it was a modest contributor to revenue growth. It does remain an important form factor for certain more complex tasks such as planning vacations or assessing insurance options. And as we have talked about in prior calls, we continue to see the ongoing importance of desktop for many users and many tasks, notwithstanding the growing utility of mobile. So I led with the items that are really driving the growth but that was a bit more color on desktop for you. Eric Sheridan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Once, again, Doug Anmuth, your line is now open, please check your mute button. Doug Anmuth : Yeah. Thanks. Sorry about that. So two questions, just following up on Eric\u2019s on the revenue growth. Ruth can you just give us a little bit more detail on the paid click growth, the decel that we saw that at 39% from the 50%s and 60%s last year. That\u2019s just a comp issue or something more specific? And then just on the spending side, I want to understand a little more just how you are thinking about spending relative to three months ago. I know you talked about both CapEx moderating and also headcount moderating three months ago. Just curious at least that headcount is still in that camp figure thinking just given that it seems like there\u2019s a pretty big ramp expected under the new Cloud CEO? Thanks. Ruth Porat : Okay. So, starting with clicks and CBCs. As we have discussed on prior calls the biggest driver affecting those CBCs and click trends is YouTube engagement ads with YouTube Clicks representing the vast majority of total clicks. And so while YouTube Clicks continue to grow at a substantial pace in the first quarter, the rate of YouTube Click growth decelerated versus what was a strong Q1 last year reflecting changes that we made in early 2018, which we believe are overall additive to the user and advertiser experience. And then in terms of your two spending the investment questions, in terms of headcount, first, we do continue to expect the growth rate to moderate slightly in 2019 from the year-on-year growth in 2018. And as I indicated in opening comments, we are continuing to invest in technical talent for priority areas like cloud, search and ML. And so cloud has been and continues to be the primary area of headcount growth and as Thomas indicated as well, I think Sundar did as well. In terms of CapEx just to fill up the last part I think of your question. Relative to my comments last quarter that we expect the full year 2019 growth rates for CapEx to moderate quite significantly versus the year-on-year growth in 2018, there\u2019s no change in our expectation for the year on that point either. The first quarter last year obviously included a sizable real estate acquisition in New York. But, overall, we continue to invest meaningfully in our technical infrastructure given our outlook for compute requirements to support long-term growth. Technical infrastructure is the biggest driver of CapEx growth, but we do also continue to invest in office facilities. In fact, as we announced in the first quarter, we expect CapEx of over $13 billion in 2019 just in the U.S. in data center construction and offices, with major expansions in 14 states. And more generally, while we are investing aggressively to support our outlook for compute requirements, we are also very focused on improving efficiency with our technical infrastructure and you can see that through our innovations and things like custom server hardware and TPUs, which can be more cost-effective especially for machine learning workloads. Doug Anmuth : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you. Sundar, I had a question about Cloud. You guys are obviously talking more and more about it. But when do you think you are going to be in a position to share revenue figures or even growth rates similar to what the others have been sharing for quite some time? And then, I guess, a couple of follow-ups to that are what would you say the biggest competitive differentiators are of GCP. And what also -- what changes has Thomas implemented for 2019? What are any of the big changes he\u2019s focused on that maybe are different than what you are doing before? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Heather. Good question. Overall, I would say, I think, you saw it -- saw the momentum coming out of Next. And I would say, the high level the key differentiators which we are focused on and which we hear from customers to the five key things are security and reliability, being really open about hybrid multi-cloud, customers don\u2019t want to be locked into anyone Cloud provider. We want to be a platform for open source and so we are really working well there in enabling options. AI, ML as a capability. And finally, as customers think about digital transformations we bring all of Google\u2019s advances to bear to help them through the journey. I think I would say, Thomas is really building upon a strong foundation, but we are really accelerating and scaling up go-to-market both internally and through our channel partners has been a huge focus. I am incredibly excited that, we just announced a couple of weeks ago that Rob Enslin has joined us to head go-to-market and just along with Thomas, both of them bring close to three decades of serving enterprise customers, and so that reflects the commitment we have. I think we are building a strong business across all our verticals, and we are definitely are seeing a strong momentum, and look forward to being able to share more at the appropriate time. Heather Bellini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore. Your line is now open. Anthony DiClemente : Thank you for taking my question. I have two, one for Ruth, one for Sundar. We noticed that large than expected slowdown in the properties TAC in the quarter that includes cost of mobile search, while the other cost of revenues which includes YouTube content cost seem to maintain an expected growth rate despite what you said about more moderate turns in hardware. So just wondering if that\u2019s a wise way to infer anything about the relative performance of mobile search revenue versus YouTube from those cost lines in the quarter? And then on Waymo, maybe for Sundar, we are hearing more and more about collaborations between ridesharing networks and AV provider, so the idea of mixed fleets or part human part AV as a means of potential deployment of AV technology. So can you just comment if that mixed lead approach would be something that you think Waymo would consider versus its own full ride service network? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So in terms of the sites TAC rate, a couple of things, we have discussed this previous -- on previous calls. We have expected the year-on-year growth in the TAC rate would begin to slow, starting in the second quarter last year and you saw that through the balance of 2018. And this quarter, the constant TAC rate versus last year reflects ongoing growth in mobile, but it also benefited from growth in YouTube, where the associated content and cost are included in other cost of sales, and so, that\u2019s the most important thing to point to. The other is -- we have previously discussed is, TAC as a percentage of revenues is also affected by a number of other factors, such as changes in product mix, device mix, partner mix, et cetera. So I\u2019d really point you to the first point there. And then, as it relates to Waymo, I guess, a couple of things. We continue to be most focused on the ride sharing business here. We are pleased with the expansion and the number of Waymo riders that we have added since the last quarter. But as we have talked about on prior calls, we do continue to pursue a number of other opportunities, long-haul trucking we have talked about, logistics, deliveries, personal use vehicles, last mile solutions for cities, and then probably more to your question, licensing our technology and we did announced in March that we are making one of our 3D-LiDAR sensors available to companies outside of the self-driving car service, beginning with robotics and physical security. In other words in, for warehouse use or for farming and our view was that, that can provide further operating leverage to our business. So we are actually looking at a number of different ways, but their primary focus continues to be on developing the ride hailing business. Anthony DiClemente : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Steve Ju : Okay. Thanks. So, Sundar, I wanted to follow up on your Stadia commentary. How are your conversations with some of the larger PC and console publishers going right now? You obviously offered them an additional distribution outlet with billions of users, which is something that they probably didn\u2019t have before. But what is the pushback that you might be getting from publishers if any? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : I mean, I think, there genuinely, I mean, I think, we see genuine excitement, because I think, they see the opportunity for a shift, a point of inflection, but they realized the technical challenge of pulling something like this off. And so, but once they get their hands on with the technology and then they see the experience, I think, completely wins people over. And so we are having conversations across the Board and I think people are definitely engaging in a very committed way and they are investing in it and so it\u2019s up to us to bring it all together and have a compelling service later this year and that\u2019s what the team has had done working on. But I think, not pushback per se, but they want to see our commitment, which is what we demonstrate and they are working hard to make the investments on their side. And so it\u2019s a big joint effort and it\u2019s working well. Steve Ju : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one just go back to the product changes. Ruth any more color on sort of which products or regions are most impacted by these changes? And just so we can understand a little bit, can you just help us with the key user experience you are trying to solve for and sort of the message to your advertisers who maybe spending -- or maybe growing their spend last now and why it\u2019s going to be positive for the long-term? And then Sundar just regarding your comment about YouTube, you mentioned more potential changes coming on YouTube with the next couple of mix. Can you just talk to us about that a little bit? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Yeah. Maybe I will start with the YouTube comments. I talked about in the area of content responsibility, we are definitely focused on making sure we are constantly improving how we are handling both in terms of reducing the content and shouldn\u2019t be there on the platform, and then more importantly, making sure when we recommend content that we are recommending high-quality content as well as reducing harmful content or low-quality content being recommended. I think we had a set of launch which we have rolled out, but I think there are more lunches coming which will constantly improve what you will see in YouTube and continues to be the most important area of focus for them. On the first question in terms of products, I think, we are -- I presume when you say it back to product changes, I think, you are talking about the advertising experience. I think the main thing I would say is, I mean, we don\u2019t -- I think we have a long-term way of thinking about where we want to go and we were disciplined framework by which we think and evolve our products. We don\u2019t necessarily look at it from a quarter-on-quarter basis, though, we obviously have had consistent performances. We approach our work differently and so you are going to have quarter-to-quarter variations once in a while. But we remain confident about the opportunities we see and I am looking ahead to that and we are focused on that. Brian Nowak : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Dan Salmon : Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar he had reminded us how April and May are pretty big months for the company with a series of your large annual events, and of course, each of them -- each of those businesses have their own goals and targets. But we also hear -- continue to hear more about your teams working together, for example, a large cloud engagement leading to higher ad spending from an enterprise. Can you talk to us just a little bit about how you balance having your leaders grow their own businesses with also incentivizing them to work together? And then second, and kind of completely differently, we would love to just hear your updated views on data collection and use. I am sure you have continue to have some dialogues with the politicians and regulators. We have seen some reports on more potential changes in Chrome or within the advertising platform. We would love to hear how maybe your latest discussions are in view -- are in forming both the near and long-term view on policies with regards to data collection and use. Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks. And you are right, these are a couple of very months and its particularly busy leading up to I/O. And I would say in terms of how we work together, first of all, as a company, I think, we take our -- okay, our process extraordinarily serious in a very committed way. And we do right across company okay hours and it really reinforces ways by which different groups can work together, and we measure them and hold people accountable to that. That\u2019s an important part of how we get at businesses both while they are focus on their product areas our business need to work together. Second as a leadership attribute, it something that\u2019s really important to me and so it\u2019s something that the leaders across the table share that goal, and I think, it\u2019s largely cultural as well, vis-\u00e0-vis privacy and it\u2019s actually one of our most important areas. As a company, we have always tried to stay a step ahead. User expectations around privacy are constantly evolving and we stretch ourselves to meet them, and as part of that through this year, we are continuing to do a lot of work just with the overall goal of making sure privacy works for everyone. It\u2019s actually simple to use. And as part of that, we will have more changes through the course of this year be it Chrome, Chrome is super committed to making sure it\u2019s best-in-class in privacy and security, and we always put user experience first and follow through. Through all these changes, we need to be mindful of the content ecosystem and the publisher ecosystem. Advertising continues to be an important way by, which they create value and they see value and so we are very thoughtful about how we approach our work. And there\u2019s been a lot of interest across the Board. I think we are early on engaged with GDPR, our big supporters of it in terms of being constructive and working early to get ready. I think it\u2019s important U.S. supports -- has a clear from work on our federal basis for privacy regulation and it\u2019s something, we feel is timely as well, and so we have call for it and happy to be thought leaders as well as engage where needed. Dan Salmon : Great. Thank you, Sundar. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Colin Sebastian : Great. Thank you. I have a couple, first one follow-up on the revenue growth dynamics, specifically the sequential growth trend. I wonder, if we should just assume now that there\u2019s greater seasonality in core search just given the increasing mix of shopping and product ad formats. And Sundar, question in AI machine learning, since clearly this remains an area of significant strength for the company. I am wondering, what\u2019s stage of development you characterize these stools at being today and whether we should expect the overall case of advancement from AI to accelerate in terms of products and services? Thank you very much. Sundar Pichai : On the first question around seasonality and stuff we -- throughout the course of the year, we always deal with many events in a no pattern as. There are a few patterns which are consistent year-on-year, but there are always one-off events which happen, so there is in-built variations -- so which we work through every quarter and so I think that\u2019s a natural part of what we do. There\u2019s definitely seasonality in businesses like hardware and that you are right commercial behavior has seasonality associated with it. But we do deal a lot with one-off events as well and -- but we always work our way through it. On machine learning, I do think we are at very early days. I am excited that over the last three years, taking AI first approach we have really incorporated machine learning core -- in a core way across our product to benefit our users and that\u2019s true for advertising as well. I think we are in early stages of making it easier for businesses to understand what they are looking for and us taking care of more and more work, and we are doing it across the Board, but there\u2019s a lot of headroom here. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Thank you. Maybe one for Ruth and one for Sundar. First Ruth, on mobile search, can you let us know how that did versus your expectations, I know there\u2019s a lot of noise from YouTube in that line. But how\u2019s mobile search doing and what are the key drivers now for mobile searches, is it queries, is it driving higher click-through rates, ad format changes, what are the drivers, as you think about the next couple of years? And then Sundar, could you just -- on the hardware business, I think, there is some concerns that it\u2019s just not getting off to really strong trajectory, some comparisons to Microsoft 10 years ago. Really, just help us understand how that hardware business is important to Google and how you are thinking about it long-term? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So in terms of the Mobile Search and the Site\u2019s revenue more broadly, I think, the main point, as we have both tried to indicate in opening comments is, we view the advertising opportunity is significant, given, in particular, the opportunity with machine learning, both for users and advertisers, as well as our commitments to product innovation and being the backdrop of an environment, which nearly half of the budgets in the U.S. are still spent offline and about 90% of commerce in the U.S. is still offline and we are focused on digital playing bigger role in that and tapping into other marketing budgets, by offering an attractive ROI. And then, apart from people spending more time on digital content, to your question, we know the better measurement, better ad delivery, better user experience, all help grow the pie for everyone in the ecosystem. And then more broadly, within YouTube, as we talked about last quarter, we do continue to see significant growth in direct response and we remain excited about the upside potential there. Brand advertising is still the largest part of the business. It\u2019s growing at a stronger pace. But we would called out direct response given what we see as the upside potential. Sundar Pichai : Justin, on the hardware business, as I said earlier, we are still in our early days. But our commitment is very strong. We really see this incredibly important to drive the future of computing forward and to make sure our services are presented to users in the way that we intended them to be, and so overall, we view it as a hugely important opportunity. When we look at the business even for -- given we are more recent to it, we already -- if you take AES like Google Home and Assistant products, we are doing really well. We see strong momentum. I think we are market leaders in the category and especially when you take a look at it on a global basis. And so for -- computing will continue to evolve even beyond phones and so we want to make sure we are in there and we are very committed to it for the long-term. Phones, definitely, across as an industry, I think, they are working through a phase where there is definite year-on-year headwinds. But I do think, especially, the ecosystem is constantly pushing it forward. I continue to be excited about the innovations be it, 5G coming or the early look into foldable phones, which Android plays a big part in driving. So I do think there is a lot more to come and we are focused on it. When I look at the product quality, how it\u2019s improving, user feedback in terms of Net Promoter Scores and the range of lineup that we are working and how our products are getting better year-on-year I remain very excited. Justin Post : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is now open. Ross Sandler : Hey, guys. I guess I will just beat the dead horse on the deceleration comment again, but maybe a different way. Ruth so why did Europe and U.S. -- Europe ex-FX and U.S. growth rates dropped off much more than Asia and are there any comment on why the decel was more pronounced in Western markets? And then stepping back we see pretty solid growth rates from the digital ad sector broadly in the first quarter and you flagged a lot of this back in February. So, clearly, this isn\u2019t a surprise to you. But how much of the deceleration insights ex-FX was from maybe advertiser demand issues in these markets versus proactive changes that you may have made on your end to the product? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So in terms of the regions, the year-on-year growth rates reflect the product comments that I have made with respect to the first quarter. The -- I think the -- you had the U.S. and Europe had about the same delta year-on-year. Other Americas was more pronounced. That was really more of the impact of hardware. And then APAC, I think maybe was guiding some of your question, continues to be a very strong performer and continue to deliver in the 30% plus or I think 31% on a fixed FX basis. We are well-positioned growth throughout the regions. Sundar\u2019s comments on some of the things that we are seeing, a big focus on the next billion users and excited about the opportunities across the Board there. Sundar Pichai : And I don\u2019t think there are any demand issues to the last part of your question, and as we said earlier, we work through a set of product development pipeline in a very disciplined way focused on user experience and that makes it\u2019s way too and that\u2019s how we approach it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will be our final question today from the line of Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Thanks. Just a follow-up on the last question on EMEA and U.S. Was there any go-to-market changes in terms of the sales force or how you said quarter anything that may have been effectively, a Q1 seasonality issue that may see some snapback in Q2? Ruth Porat : The opening comments I said that one of the points is that we had a strong year last year and we are looking at performance in line with that. I would say more broadly overall in terms of go-to-market, our long-term investment thesis remains unchanged. We are excited about the opportunities ahead. We do continue to invest to ensure we remain well-positioned for the long-term. That applies across the businesses and so that there wasn\u2019t a change that anything other than the comments that I had made. I think if I could just maybe expand on the investing pace, as we are looking at the pace of investing and supporting growth around the globe, what we are really looking at is what\u2019s needed to support long-term revenue and earnings growth, the operating margin did benefit, and as I noted in my opening comments that, from the fact that Q1 marketing expense, growth moderated, but that was the timing issue. We do expect to pick up the marketing expense in the second quarter and other than that really nothing to comment on. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for closing remarks. Ellen West : Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter call. Thank you and have a good afternoon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.  I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ellen West : Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Alphabet's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat. Sundar Pichai : Thanks Ellen. Q2 was an exciting quarter at Google. We made several big announcements at I/O, YouTube's Brandcast, and Google Marketing Live. They're all part of our broader vision to build a more helpful Google for everyone. When we say everyone, we mean users, developers, creators, partners, advertisers, and all the customers of our growing cloud business, and the communities we call Home. From the beginning, Google's mission has been to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Over the years, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that helps you get things done. Today, I'll share how we are approaching this work. Building a more helpful Google starts with advancing our core information mission. In Q2, we have made a number of improvements to our founding product, Search. We redesigned our mobile search page and brought our popular full coverage feature to search to better organize news results. We are also integrating augmented reality into Search. So, if say, you're searching for new shoes online, you can view the shoes in 3D or even superimpose them onto your wardrobe to see if they match. Thanks to advancements in AI, we are making significant improvements to the Google Assistant. The next-generation Assistant, can process requests up to 10 times faster, making it easier to multi-task, compose e-mails, and even work offline. With features like Duplex on the web, that system will soon be able to help users book rental cars and buy movie tickets. If you are searching for the fastest way home, Google Maps will now tell you when your bus is delayed or how packed your next train will be. We have rolled this out to people in 200 cities worldwide. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Sundar. In the second quarter, total revenues of $38.9 billion were up 19% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency. Once again, our results were driven by ongoing strength in mobile search, in particular, as well as YouTube and Cloud. I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets and we'll include with our outlook. We will then take your questions. Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $38.9 billion reflect an acceleration in both reported and constant currency revenue growth across all regions compared with the first quarter. Details of our results by geographic region are available in our earnings press release. Turning to profitability. On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment, was $17.3 billion, up 25% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.1 billion, up 35% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. Operator : Thank you.  And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. And really appreciate all the additional commentary and disclosure in the remarks. I think investors will find that really helpful. Sundar maybe could you, one bigger picture question. A lot of innovation on the product side in the early part of this year. Now those products are going to start getting rolled out in the back part of this year and into 2020. Can you give us a little bit of additional color on what some of the key investments you're making, some of the key themes you're trying to drive after in terms of pushing the organization to collaborate on product launches and leveraging the strength within Google? And then the second part of the question would be, as you lower friction for consumers on the product side, what are you hearing from advertisers on the monetization site about how those product might resonate on the monetization piece? Thank you so much. Sundar Pichai : Thanks Eric. On -- in terms of the key investments, we still continue. We have been focused on our investments in AI. So that continues to be kind of a foundational investment we are making across the board, including getting a lot of our engineers trained on AI techniques et cetera across the board. So it's an important area we are focused on. And making sure, digging deeper to push our products to be more helpful is the main theme, by which we are evaluating everything we do. Beyond that be it, the focus on cloud has been a big part of it, continuing to scale up YouTube including being focused on content responsibility. These are all some of the key things we are doing. And of course deep focus on Search and Assistant being a core part of everything we do. In terms of the work we are doing on consumers and the impact it has on monetization. And I do think they go hand-in-hand as we are making the experience better for customers, including on products like Discover. So just getting information to them more seamlessly when they need it, I think they all tend to have a commercial aspect at the right intent when users are interested in it. And so we always see them go hand-to-hand. And so taking a long-term view, I think it will resonate on the monetization side as well. Ruth Porat : And just building a bit of that question and the impact from some of the announcements that you've seen from us. To just comment a bit on the impact from Google Marketing Live that Sundar referenced at the outset. I think what's notable here is that every year at GML, we announced new changes to products and features and most ads product launches are introduced in phases as advertisers initially experiment with new formats. And so as a result the new products that were announced at GML typically are adopted over time. And so I just wanted to add in here because while we're excited about the new ads products we announced to GML last quarter, given they offer great new user experiences across new services, we don't view this year's slate of launches differently from introductions made in previous years. Eric Sheridan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Douglas Anmuth : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was just hoping Ruth, you could just talk a bit more about the accelerating growth that you saw in 2Q relative to the slowdown that we saw in 1Q. It seems certainly in the previous quarter to skew more to the Google Search site than YouTube. I was just hoping you could provide little more clarity on maybe how the product changes that you've talked about in the past played out across 1Q and 2Q. And then just Sundar on user privacy and control over data, that was certainly a key theme across the multiple events in 2Q. Can you just talk about how you balance those initiatives as you're rolling out products going forward? Thanks. Ruth Porat : So, starting first with the strength in sites revenue. The strength we talked about here this quarter reflects the same underlying trends that we discussed previously. And I tried to really call that out in opening comments. And part is the benefit from applying machine learning to both the user and advertiser experience. And it really just -- I'm echoing a lot of what we said in prior quarters the last quarters where we remain very positive about the opportunity set. We introduced product changes only after extensive testing, which means there can be some variability in quarterly growth rates as you've seen, but are very positive about the opportunity set. And overall as it relates to both Search and YouTube strength, I would just to add on YouTube revenue growth for YouTube was strong in the first quarter. In fact, we called it out as the second largest driver of revenue growth across Alphabet. And in the second quarter, YouTube was again the second largest contributor of revenue growth. And really pleased with the ongoing momentum that we're seeing here. Sundar Pichai : On user privacy and control, it's always been a big focus for us in some of the things we recently announced. Initiative is underway for example like federated learning for almost three years. So, going forward, I think you'll continue to see us focus on. I think it's one of the most important areas we are working on. But I think with AI, we are excited that we can give better experiences for users with less data over time. And those are the kind of directions we are pushing. We are also -- you'll see us continue to work hard to simplify user understanding of how their data is used and giving them better controls and making it more easy for them to manage and making sure more users actually exercise those controls. So, those are all our goals and we'll continue focusing on that as we move forward. Douglas Anmuth : Thank you both. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Stephen Ju : Okay. Thank you. So, Ruth in regards to the Cloud $8 billion annual run rate commentary, just wondering if we can get some clarifications there. Does this include GCP as well as G Suite? And further is this apples-to-apples to I guess the $1 billion that you -- I think Sundar talked about, I think that was during the fourth quarter of 2017. And any other comments you can add there in terms of the mix between I guess the more GCP versus the more traditional G Suite? Thank you. Ruth Porat : Yes. So, it does include the entire business that Thomas Kurian is leading. Our Cloud business that includes both GCP and G Suite. And it is on an apples-to-apples basis. It continues to be the business the cloud business. We're not breaking out the components of cloud as I tried to indicate in opening comments, pleased with the performance of both GCP and G Suite. Growth in GCP was led by strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products and G Suite continues to deliver strong growth, as I noted in the opening comments, with the results benefiting from both new pricing and   growth. And overall, GCP remains one of the fastest growing businesses in Alphabet and we're really pleased with how the team is executing on both. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you very much. And I'll just echo people's comments about the new disclosure. That's much appreciated. So thank you so much for sharing. I wanted to ask, Sundar, how you've seen your go-to-market and partnership strategies change under Thomas? It does seem that Google has become the more friendly cloud company, if you will, from a -- when you think about partnering with other software companies. And I'm wondering if there's any tangible benefits you can point to because of this, whether it's in win rates or partner momentum or anything else that you can call out. And then, I also wanted to ask, you obviously made the acquisition of Looker recently. How are you thinking about organic versus inorganic product development? And I'm just wondering, has the thought process there changed with Thomas running the business now? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Heather. I appreciate it. Definitely go-to-market, Thomas has been heavily focused on it. Mainly with the realization that we are very competitive when we are there in the banks. And so, focusing on how we can scale up and really build a customer-facing organization. So, we are investing heavily, be it in sales, service, partner and operational teams. And as I mentioned in my opening comments, we are looking to triple the size of our sales force over the next few years. And we are doing it aggressively in major markets around the world. Some specifics, we did launch our new partner program Partner Advantage. The ASAP relationship has been super important to us. And so, we have really focused on that, helping many customers make us care for. Home Depot, Cardinal Health, are some examples of that. And a big part of it has been really expanding our customer-facing bench. Several new senior executive hires in addition to our new Global Head of Sales. We recently added a 25-year customer experience veteran to build out our customer support. So I think, you're good to see that focus of being -- serving customers. We have done it in our other areas. We are used to building ecosystems. If you look at an ecosystem like Android, this is what we do. And so, that's going to be a focus for us. In terms of the second question about organic and -- versus inorganic. I think we are clearly focused on the areas where we are differentiated. Data and business analytics was a key, data management and analytics is a key area for us. And as part of that, we looked at gaps we have, which would help us complete the solution offering we have there for customers. And that's what drove the Looker acquisition. So we'll be customer focused. And to the extent we see gaps there -- gaps anywhere, we'll obviously look at doing it in-house, versus whether there's an attractive opportunity outside and take it on a case-by-case basis. But that's where it will come from. Heather Bellini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Can I try two questions, please. Ruth - first, Ruth, just any color on that 25 billion share repurchase authorization, why 25, not 20, not 30, any color there. And then, when you think about ad business. We've seen this nice acceleration in Q2, but that's kind of back to norm. There's still this question about what happened in Q1. Was there something that happened in Q1 that you needed to correct in Q2? Is it just the normal rhythms of the search in YouTube and advertising businesses? So I find Q1 still a little bit of a question mark. Q2 seems like very much the norm with the last several years. So any color on what could have transpired in Q1 then that required a fix in Q2? Thanks a lot. Ruth Porat : I'll answer them in reverse order. I tried to comment on that last quarter and reiterated again this quarter. We are pleased with the ongoing momentum in the business. And the key point that I'll just reiterate is that as much as there is a lot of innovation going on in the business and we've talked about that, we introduced product changes only after extensive testing and that means there can be variability in quarterly growth rates as you've seen. And so we're pleased with the strength of the business. The team is extremely focused on ensuring we're delivering for users and advertisers. And as we're looking out, we talked in the past we have introduced over 100 enhancements to the user set every quarter and no unchanged drives results. And as we discussed last quarter, there can be timing variability and our view is let's ensure that we stay focused on the right things for the long-term and the quality that we can deliver. So there's really not much more to add there. And then on the capital return. I guess, the main point is we went back to this year, we're staying with the same capital allocation framework we've talked with you about before. The primary thing is we remain focused on investing for long-term growth and the primary use of capital really is to support that growth. And then the second use is really to support acquisitions and investments as we've already been talking about. And given the -- our outlook on cash, our view was that it was appropriate to step in here again. We've increased our program four times since we began the program in 2015, and pleased to have the opportunity to announce another increase here today. The $25 billion and I think the main point is we view the repurchase program as an effective use of capital. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thanks, Ruth. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. The first one, Ruth your color on YouTube was really helpful on being the second largest driver this quarter and last quarter. I guess with that as a backdrop with the overall acceleration, can you just give us a couple examples, what types of products or advertisers segments or regions resonate particularly well on YouTube this quarter versus last quarter? And then a question for Sundar or Ruth. This has been recent announcement in press about children safety on YouTube. And so I guess I'm just curious to hear for advertisers and parents on the call, what steps have you taken to really make sure that YouTube is safe for kids. And what are the biggest areas you're focused on to make sure it stays that way? Thanks. Ruth Porat : So in terms of YouTube growth, just maybe to add a bit more there given your question. I already noted that YouTube revenue growth was strong in the first quarter and again strong here in the second quarter. To clarify, the changes in early 2018 that I referenced on the call last quarter, regarding sites click and CPC growth were not related to policy enforcement actions at YouTube. They had a negligible impact on YouTube revenues. Just to be a really clear. The revenue growth was strong last quarter. And so the click and CPC growth are unrelated to actions on policy enforcement in terms of our ongoing efforts to protect the YouTube ecosystem, we do remain focus and taking the right steps in line with our goals, regardless of impact on the revenues. But an important point is to the removal of content that violates our policies have virtually no impact on YouTube revenues. I just wanted to make sure that was clear. So, consistent growth here. Going into your -- the first part of your question. Where is that growth? Again, I'm going to reiterate what we've talked about on prior calls that we continue to see substantial growth in direct response. So, brand advertising is still the largest part of the business. It's growing at a strong pace. But really I would reiterate what we said previously that we continue to see substantial growth in direct response. Sundar Pichai : And on your important question about kids' safety, as part of our content responsibility work it's one of the most important areas we focus on. You will see us -- this is why we have put a lot of effort into developing YouTube Kids and it's a product you're going to see us focus more and continue to evolve, add more curated content there, and make sure it's safe for kids and give parents peace of mind. Also ensuring that the content responsibility work applies to family-oriented content on the main YouTube app as well. So, all the work we are doing be it the work we are doing to just remove that content raise up authoritative content higher quality content and reducing the step of harming content all applies everywhere and we're really focused on it. Rewarding trusted creators is a big way we can help -- ensuring greater to produce content which is great for children rewinding them. It's also an important goal for us. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Dan Salmon : All right. Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe that's for Ruth, but Sundar feel free to jump in. The first one here is based on a couple of comments you reminded us in your prepared remarks about YouTube which was the inclusion of Originals and YouTube TV in the Google Preferred inventory. You've given us a little bit of color on direct response growth at YouTube over the last little while. Can we assume that those two additions were a bit of a boost to the brand advertising side of the business as that's more inventory available for that for that sort of high-quality type of brand orientation that TV advertisers are looking for? And then just second coming back to Google Marketing Live notwithstanding your comments Ruth that it take some time for products to be adopted. There are maybe one or two out of those announcements there that you would highlight as being potentially particularly material over the longer term? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On the first in terms of YouTube for brand, I would say it's more secular across the platform promoting higher-quality content, our work on brand safety, content, responsibility adds up to it. Also creators just generating better content. I think all have played a part and I would say it's more crosscutting. On the second thing on Gmail in terms of things we were excited about. To me be discovery ads and gallery ads, I mean they're both pushing us towards mobile first visually-rich immersive ad formats, which also offers a really great user experience. So I think I'm excited about changes like that and I think they have the potential. There is advertiser excitement. But as Ruth mentioned it's early days and I think we rollout now, it takes time to play out. But we definitely see excitement there. Dan Salmon : Great. Thanks, Sundar. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark May from Citi. Your line is now open. Mark May : Thank you. Well, first is for Sundar. I think earlier Ruth had mentioned the importance of machine learning for driving growth in the quarter, and I'm sure in many recent quarters. I believe many have a hard time understanding exactly what that means. And I was hoping you might provide a couple of specific examples of how the company is leveraging machine learning recently to help drive growth and improvements for both users and advertisers? And then secondly for Ruth in terms of the sites TAC, I know there are a lot of variables that go in the changes in sites TAC. But when you look at the puts and takes, how do you see that trending over the next year or two? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : For us, machine learning plays a critical role across both the consumer user experience and part of ads too. Generally using machine learning to simplify things for advertisers and make campaigns easier and give them better insights is where we see a lot of benefit on the ad sites. So, for example, processing complex datasets and giving back sophisticated real-time insights really helps make a difference. And also on the front end for marketers, helping them find the right creator for every moment, helping them manage bidding in real-time. And so every step in the consumer journey, I think machine learning is just making things more efficient, more easier to use and driving productivity for them. So that's what plays out through our systems. Ruth Porat : And in terms of the TAC rate. As we've talked about previously, the growth in mobile does put upward pressure in the sites TAC rate and that was the primary driver of the year-on-year increase in the second quarter. And we do expect the underlying trend to continue given the ongoing growth in mobile. Mark May : Thanks Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is now open. Colin Sebastian : Thanks. A couple for me as well. First off, as you embrace more commerce and payments on the platform broadly speaking along with the new ad formats you've talked about, can you also talk about what role take rates might play in terms of future initiatives and revenue growth? And then secondly on Assistant and Duplex, in terms of near-term Search innovation, I wonder if you could characterize how important that is in terms of the momentum you're seeing and longer term, how this might impact platform monetization? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On the first question, I think it's a good question. There's a lot of discovery that happens across Google's properties and including Search and YouTube. And so anything we can do to make sure users have a better experience when they are interested in transacting will have a big role. So there's a lot more work underway to make sure payments work better. Sign in works better. Payments works better. All of that I think will be -- over the long-term will be drivers, because it improves overall user expense especially for commercial clicks. In terms of Assistant and Duplex, I mean, for us Assistant is where we can clearly see we can really push our goal of being more helpful to users, helping them get things done, including things that matter in the real word. And so, that's what we are focused on. And if we get that right, just like with the Search, there are many things which users want to get done, which do have commercial intent to them. And I think that's the value-creation opportunity as well. But we are focused on making sure the user experience constantly gets better and we are investing to get there. Colin Sebastian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Sundar, there's been a lot of regulatory news lately, especially from the DOJ. Just wondering how you think about a more intense regulatory environment. Getting a lot of questions and wondering, if you think about that, really affecting Google operations. And then, Ruth, definitely nice acceleration across the board. Of course, Europe accelerated as well. When you think about GDPR implementation last year and you're lapping that, is that helping Europe at all? Or was there really no impact from GDPR? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On the regulatory question, we understand that there will be scrutiny. We are - we will engage constructively. It's not new to us. We have participated in these processes before. Today we do operate under a lot of regulation, be it on privacy, be it on competition, be it on copyright, intellectual property, et cetera. And even in the U.S., we have engaged in the process before to the extent we have to answer questions, we will do so constructively. And to the extent there are concerns, we'll address them as well. But I think, for me, it's important that we stay focused on building helpful products to users and that's the value we ultimately provide our users. And I think that's what we'll stay focused on as a company. Ruth Porat : And in terms of GDPR, we did implement late in the second quarter of 2018. We think it's, obviously, a critical area, making sure we get it right. That's at the overall impact of regulation on consumers and businesses, is it still playing out. And we're very focused on making sure we're doing what's best for users and ensuring we're compliant with the law, not based on any potential revenue impact. Justin Post : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is now open. Ross Sandler : Hey guys. If I can squeeze two in real quick. Ruth, the Google segment operating profit was up 16%. That's the highest growth rate in about two years. So, I guess, how should we think about the cadence of that relative to your comments about the headcount growth in the Looker acquisition looking forward? And then Sundar, at I/O you mentioned that active Android installed base is now over 2.5 billion. That's up about 10% year-on-year and a lot of that\u2019s coming from emerging markets. So, I guess, just big picture, how do we think about the growth rates that you can sustain in mobile search revenue relative to that 10% active Android growth rate? Thank you. Ruth Porat : Yeah. Thanks for that. I tried to enumerate the things as we're looking forward very much to your question. Our overall long-term investment thesis is unchanged. We are very focused on investing to support the ongoing growth we see across Google in particular as we're talking about in Search while we're also investing to build new businesses most notably in Cloud as we've talked a lot about here today. And across all of Alphabet, we do continue to benefit from machine learning that's both OpEx and CapEx. And as we both commented given the opportunities we see with the application of machine learning across the business, we are continuing to invest. Our lens on the pace of investing does have three facets in it. First is investing at the appropriate pace to support long-term earnings growth. And then we were very focused second on optimizing investments within each product area. And finally, as we've talked about investing to support operational excellence. But the mega point is that we are excited about the long-term opportunity and we're continuing to invest which is why in opening comments, I wanted to make sure to call out what we're seeing with respect to ongoing investments and across the business the increases in headcount and the reasons for them at the benefits of those investments as well as sales and marketing and the fact that that is back half loaded and -- back half weighted I should say. And so try to lay out the relevant points for you to ensure that we make it very clear. We are committed to continue to invest for what we see as a long-term opportunities. Sundar Pichai : And on the mobile question, we are definitely investing in Android with a focus on the next billion users as well as making sure the mobile experience continues to evolve. In terms of the mobile experience, I still think from a user standpoint, there's a lot of information overload. So, being helpful to users and helping them navigate it be it Search, Assistant, Maps, and YouTube I think we are focused on the opportunities there. And in terms of the next billion users there's a lot of headroom there over time and we are focused on. That's why we take efforts like Android Go seriously. We are constantly working hard to lower the barrier so that more people can benefit from being online and participating in the digital economy and so it will continue to be a focus for us. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for closing remarks. Ellen West : Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter call. Thank you and have a good afternoon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time, all participants\u2019 lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ellen West : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Ellen, and good afternoon. Q3 was another great quarter at Google with strong revenue growth driven by mobile search, YouTube, and Cloud. We celebrated Google's 21st birthday this quarter. While our mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful hasn't changed, we've evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that helps you get things done. Since the beginning, we've always invested in tackling deep computer science problems that can have a significant impact on society. The chance to be part of these fundamental engineering challenges is why so many people want to work at Google. In just the last week we have announced two significant advances. First, powered by our long-term investment in AI, we dramatically improved our understanding of the questions people ask Google Search. It's the biggest leap forward for search in the past five years. It\u2019s all possible because of a new type of neural network-based technique for natural language processing called BERT, which recognizes subtle patterns in language and provides more relevant results. Second, we recently announced a major quantum computing milestone. I was extraordinarily proud to visit our team in Santa Barbara. To demonstrate supremacy, Google's 53-qubit quantum machine Sycamore, successfully performed a test computation in just 200 seconds that would have taken the most powerful supercomputers much longer time to accomplish. It's the Hello, World! moment we\u2019ve been waiting for and represents a distinct milestone in our effort to harness the principles of quantum mechanics, to solve computational problems. Turning from quantum to the quarter. Today, I'll talk about the momentum we saw across the business in the last three months. First, Cloud. We saw customer momentum across multiple areas under Thomas\u2019 leadership. In September, we announced a landmark partnership with Mayo Clinic. Using Google Cloud to secure and store data and understand insights at scale, Mayo Clinic will partner with us in many ways. Together, we'll work to transform patient and clinician experiences, identify new methods of diagnosing diseases, conduct clinical research, and find new models for delivering patient care. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Sundar. In the third quarter, total revenues of $40.5 billion were up 20% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency. Once again, our results were driven by ongoing strength in mobile search, YouTube and Cloud. I will begin with the review of the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by other Bets and conclude with our outlook. Sundar and I will then take your questions. Details of Alphabet\u2019s consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release. Regarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment, was $17.6 billion, up 23% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.1 billion, up 31% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The biggest contributor again this quarter was costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of their revenues. This line also includes the impact of hardware costs, primarily associated with our mid-tier Pixel 3a smartphones. Operating expenses were $13.8 billion, with headcount growth being the largest driver of year-on-year growth for both R&D and sales and marketing, which is reflected in both compensation and facilities expenses. With respect to R&D, the growth was again driven by the addition of engineering talent, consistent with our focus on product innovation. The increase in G&A year-over-year was primarily due to a $554 million charged from our previously announced legal settlements in France. Stock-based compensation totaled $2.6 billion. Headcount was up 6,450 from the second quarter. And consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in cloud for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $9.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year for an operating margin up 23%. Other income and expense was a loss of $549 million, which primarily reflects the impact of unrealized losses and marketable equity securities. As of September 30, the unrealized equity gain in the combined portfolio of marketable and nonmarketable securities was $5.8 billion. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Net income was $7.1 billion and earnings per diluted share were $10.12. Operator :  And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two, if I can. First, Sundar, big picture question. It feels like the concept of the ambient computing was sort of prevalent at the Made by Google event recently. It started with sort of a bit of a shift in theme, what I could tell at Google I/O earlier this year. Can you just talk about what some of the key investments you want to make to capitalize on that opportunity into long-term? How you think Google and maybe broader Alphabet is positioned to capitalize on that? How it might show up at the product services layer? So, I guess, maybe a three-part question, more of a bigger picture nature. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Eric. We are very excited by the vision of ambient computing and evolving that. I think, it's a continuity in the sense that over time computing should be more intuitive to users and computing should adapt to users, not the other way around. And the foundations of all of this is all the work we have done with our computing platforms till date and under successful consumer services and developer platforms we have built. And I think that's the most of the investments there. The phones will continue to be at the center of ambient computing for the future. So, that's another important piece where we are already invested in. I think, as we expand beyond and that's what the Made by Google family is focused on, products in your home with our Nest family of products, and wearables which we do with Wear OS and so on. So, supporting that ecosystem, so whether you're at home or on the go or at work, and making sure it works. Our investments in the AI across the Company, I think, will end up playing a key role, AI and Assistant. I think, they'll be at the center of making sure we can anticipate what users want and serve them better. Operator : And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Doug Anmuth : Sundar, you talked about the new neural network techniques talking about the biggest breakthrough in Search in years. Could you just help us understand if that\u2019s impacting kind of the advertising and monetization side of the business yet or how that can play out going forward? Sundar Pichai : Anytime -- maybe I\u2019ll answer it, as BERT, which is the name of the technique we're using, and we\u2019ve rolled it out in Search now. And obviously, anytime we can better make sense of queries, we can serve users better, our search quality goes up, and people engage and that\u2019s -- engage more. So, it's part of a long run sort of things we've been working on, but this is one of our bigger breakthroughs in terms of helping improve the search experience and search quality. And remember, it will help us in a certain set of queries. There are many queries which we\u2019re already working well, but it helps us capture nuance and help understand human context better. And so, I would just characterize this as a big improvement, which improves search quality and creates that virtuous cycle by which people engage more. Of course, a lot of times, we take the same techniques, and sometimes it makes sense on the app side, and down the line, machine learning techniques. And we'll deploy it there as well. Operator : And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : I just wanted to follow up on a couple of the comments you made about Cloud, Sundar. I was wondering if you could just give us some color on the size of your GCP backlog. And maybe even if you just talk about the trajectory, and how that's changed over the course of the last year? And then, you mentioned the strength and the uptake of BigQuery, I'm just trying to think through how we should think of the margin, level of a service like this versus the traditional compute offerings where you've seen strength to date. And just wondering, if we start to see some positive mix shifts benefits, as some of these premium products start to start to ramp more aggressively? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Heather. Overall, I know, we gave some visibility into our cloud business and we'll continue to do that periodically. And the momentum has been great. Obviously, ever since Thomas has come in, he has continued to invest across the board. He\u2019s definitely focused a lot on scaling up our sales partner and operational teams. And, it's playing out well. In this business, it's important for you to be in as many deal situations as possible and get those wins, which accrues over time. And so, we are definitely seeing the momentum. Analytics is a huge area of strength for us. And it's an area, which Thomas has a lot of expertise in as well. And BigQuery is such a strong product, so it's a natural area, we are seeing strength. And my sense is, as we get -- if I look at the TAM, the percentage of TAM for which we were eligible, compared to two years ago to last year to now, that number is shifting aggressively due to either completing our product feature set or be completing some of the certifications we need. And so, I think, there are several strong forward-looking indicators and look forward to sharing more at the right time. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Can I just ask you to draw a little bit more out on Google Maps? I know that\u2019s for marketing earlier in the year that that seems like that's now at a stage where it's going to be better integrated into the -- I don't know, the purchase path or whatever, you're making it easier for small businesses to tap into what should be really nicely qualified leads. Just talk about the pace at which that -- the monetization of that or just the ad opportunities will be offered to small businesses? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : In general, local is an important area for us, and we are continuing to invest in building experience that connects merchants, advertisers and users. Google My Business has been our major effort there. Today millions of businesses are -- reach and engage, both through Search and Maps. Specifically, in GML, we announced that we\u2019ll expand local campaigns. I presume that's what you're talking about. It's still early. And in general, we want to make it easier for advertisers, particularly SMBs to come to Google and be able to reach users across our set of owned and operated properties. So, be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Discover, be it Maps, and that's the way we envision that. But, small and medium business is a big area of focus and maps represents a big, long-term opportunity for us. Ruth Porat : And just to add on there, given you referenced back to GML, and I think we talked about this last quarter as well. Our view is that the products that were introduced to GML, this year, like in previous years, they're rolled out in phases, they're adopted over time. And so, we don't view the potential impact from this year's slate differently than the impact from products that were launched at previous events, and so just to kind of keep that in perspective. Operator : And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Lloyd Walmsley : I wanted to ask another one about new product you guys announced earlier this year at GML. And that was really Google Shopping and moving that across some of the new different properties like YouTube and Image Search and Discover. Can you give us a sense for where you are in that migration, kind of over what timeframe should we be thinking about that? And then, maybe just elaborate a bit on the long-term vision of moving shopping functionality into properties like YouTube and how you think that experience will evolve? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : In general, I think it\u2019s paid opportunity for us. We see tons of what I would call commercial user journeys across Google. Obviously Search is an important area, Image Search, YouTube, Maps all great surfaces by which I think users come with varying degrees of commercial interest, looking to discover and at times transact as well. So, we\u2019ve started thinking much more holistically about what are those experiences and how can we make it better. That involves helping improve the Discovery experience, but when people are interested in it, being able to make it easier to transact. So, the equivalent of being signed and being able to pay when you want and then of course the fulfillment and logistics. So, we're thinking through the end to end experience across all our surfaces and are investing. But, I see the user interest, and it\u2019s an area that I think we have significant opportunities ahead. Ruth Porat : And again, these are still earlier stage and it\u2019s -- we\u2019re excited about the longer term impact. But, just again make it clear we\u2019re just still in the earlier stages of testing. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Ruth, I think you mentioned the Desktop Search might have been one of the contributors of growth. Can you just talk to us little bit about what types of products or verticals you\u2019re still seeing growth? I know desktop search really impressive, given how long has this been around. And then, Sundar, with all the exciting changes going on with search become more relevant et cetera. Can you just talk about some of the KPIs that you monitor or what you're seeing when it comes to query volumes, click through rate, overall response time, what are you seeing that sort of gives you confidence that you\u2019ll continue to get more and more relevant results for your users? Thanks. Ruth Porat : So, in terms of desktop, I described it as a solid contributor to revenue growth. And what we see is that desktop does remain an important form factor for certain more complex tasks. So, things like planning vacations or assessing insurance options, what we see is users continue to go back to desktop, notwithstanding the growing utility of mobile. And I think one of the things that we\u2019ve been very focused on is that innovations that benefit mobile also enhance the desktop experience for users and advertisers. Sundar Pichai : And then, in terms of -- obviously, we\u2019ve been -- over time, we've developed very comprehensive metric for measuring and tracking search -- search quality -- to get a sense of such quality and how user satisfaction is through search. But, to give you a sense of -- we continue to take that work deeper, we realize users sometimes do searches through sessions understanding what is their satisfaction across the session, what is their engagement, are they getting at what they are looking for? Those are all some of the deeper work we are undertaking, and also understanding by vertical how we are helping users. There was an earlier question around shopping and commerce. That's an example of the kind of vertical and what can we do to make that experience better. Health is another vertical in which we have a whole Google Health team focused on understanding the in-depth experience that would give better experience overall in search. So, very comprehensive effort and we are constantly looking to do it deeper and broader at the same time. Operator : And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is now open. Colin Sebastian : I have two. Sundar, there's clearly a lot of innovation happening at Google. But, I'm wondering how do you think about the increase in scrutiny and oversight possibly impacting your ability to explore new services or new markets over time, and ultimately to remain competitive? And second, Sundar or Ruth, we don't often ask about the display network, but just wondering, given all the concerns around privacy, ad blocking and the like, how do you view this business strategically, as part of the overall ecosystem? Sundar Pichai : On the first part, we consistently want to work and build products that benefit users and support the ecosystem. And so, our products and services benefit consumers, small and medium businesses, advertisers, and overall, they help reduce prices and expand choice. And so, that's our underlying approach, I think, which is what helps us engage and explain to regulators and we\u2019ll continue to do that. I think, there are also many new areas of opportunities available for us, and in many of these areas we are the new entrant and we create competition. And sometimes the competitive pressures can lead to concerns from others. And so, that's part of what's going on as well. But, the other area is, in addition to developed markets, we are investing deeply in our next billion users. So, markets like APAC continue to be bit long term opportunities for us as well. Operator : And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays. Ross Sandler : Ruth, just, if you rewind the clock a little bit, when we entered this year, you had called out how some product changes may cause year-over-year growth rates to fluctuate from time to time. And we haven't heard that in a couple of quarters. So, as we look out towards like 2020 and beyond, do you feel like a lot of the product queue is in a good place, as far as Search and YouTube are concerned, and that these product changes might be a little bit more subtle going forward, or could we return to having more meaningful impact in the future, just any color there? And then, on the third quarter, the Asia region, the growth rate was solid but a tad lower than the prior trend. So, anything notable to call out on APAC? Ruth Porat : So, in terms of the first question, I think, as Sundar and I talked about, we're pleased with the strength of the business that you've seen here again in the third quarter. And as we said, since the IPO, we don't manage the business to maximize quarterly results and we'll always do the right thing for the long term. We're very focused on investing for the long term. And I tried to make it clear in opening comments that as a result, quarterly growth can vary and has varied. And I think to your question, our view is that quarterly growth around the rates you've seen since the beginning of the year, for us underscore the strength and the vibrancy actually in our business. And that's particularly true at our size, in the last 12 months we've generated over $150 billion in total revenues. That's about $25 billion of growth in the last year. And we are continuing to invest in long-term opportunities. But, I would make the point that we do keep a lens to the long-term. In terms of your question about geographies. When we look at the performance on a fixed FX basis around the globe, pleased with the performance again in the third quarter. You aptly point out, year-on-year growth in APAC in the third quarter was a bit lower than the second quarter. That primarily reflected slower growth in the network business, and that was in part due to policy changes. It also reflected the fact that the launch of the Pixel 3a was in the second quarter, which boosted the year-on-year growth rate in the second quarter. But, I think also implicit in your question, at 26% year-on-year growth on a fixed FX basis, running it about now $7 billion in quarterly revenues, we\u2019re really pleased with all what the team is doing and the year-on-year growth rate. Operator : And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Dan Salmon : Sundar, maybe you could give us a little bit of an update on the Discover feed. That's a new product that we featured in the past that I know a lot of users are getting more use out of. You gave us I think some updates on monthly active users or DA use in the past. Any update there would be great or maybe any additional color on sort of how the total amounts of usage goes on there, that's obviously been featured to users a little bit more. And then, second, maybe just a follow-up for Ruth. Sundar spoke at length about your investments in renewable energy earlier and maybe keeping with the theme of the earnings call, you could help us understand how that is or maybe is not helping drive efficiencies across the country -- across the Company and your operating costs overall? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Discover is the product we are very excited about. I think, it completes the other half of Search. Search is, we do our mission for our users and be helpful when they come to us looking for information, Discover is the other half where we are proactively understanding what might be most helpful or relevant to them and getting it to them. And we definitely are focused on product quality and making sure the product is actually helpful to users, and when they engage with it, they find it useful. And it's definitely we are making progress. Our investments and machine learning are helping us well. We are definitely able to better anticipate and give them information proactively. So, over time, I see it as important area for us. And it's done and close. It's part of our search and knowledge efforts. And as we do that, you can imagine, you may have started a query in Search, and it's a session, maybe you're looking to take a trip somewhere, or you're researching a particular topic, we may be able to continue that discussion on the user journey in Discover, and that creates a virtuous cycle. So, these are -- we want to be helpful to users in a way that makes sense for them, more continually, and the combination of Search and Discover helps us do that. Ruth Porat : And in terms of your question on sustainability, we're proud of the work that we're doing. We do think that it\u2019s a valuable part of what we do, and we do consider the impact on the business and on the financials. It really cuts across every element of what we do, what we\u2019re doing in our technical infrastructure, the way we\u2019re thinking about our products that Sundar talked about, what we're doing with our facilities, what we're doing with AI. And I think it was about a year ago we talked about how we were applying machine learning to energy efficiency in our data centers, and it did have a net benefit. It helped us reduce energy consumption, not only positive for sustainability but was an efficiency effort. Sundar talked about the fact that we are investing -- recently announced that we are purchasing, making an equal investment in renewable energy, part of our commitment to offset 100% of our electricity use with renewable. And in our view this is catalyzing further investment in renewable. That is going to have a modest short-term increase in cost. But, we think it\u2019s beneficial to catalyzing the overall growth in traditional energy. So, there are puts and takes and that we're proud of the work across everything that we are doing to support sustainability. Operator : And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Stephen Ju : So, Sundar, I was wondering if you can put the quantum computing investment into some sort of perspective. Compute needs for Google have to be exponentially higher versus when you first launched. So, we\u2019re wondering if this helps you get your arms around that ever-increasing compute need. And further, I think you\u2019ll find that investors are as impatient as you guys are for progress. So, can you talk about what kind of products or services this will help you create that you other couldn\u2019t even think about doing before? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : I\u2019m incredibly proud of the work that the team did and excited about the advancement in the whole industry. I think, in general, obviously, we\u2019ve relied on advances in computing to be able to do what we do. And when we look ahead, we definitely see being able to drive the pace of change here fastest is an important need for us as well as I think source of competitive advantage. As Moore\u2019s Law effects have diminished, I think, we are looking at variety of approach to make sure we can continue doing what we need to. And in that this is an important tool into arsenal. While quantum will take many years to really start making a difference, we want to be at the cutting edge of driving it. I don\u2019t think over time for sure, cloud itself, we do see a lot of interest from cloud customers, particularly in cutting-edge verticals about quantum computing. And so, that's an area where I think we\u2019ll participate in as a business, and more importantly applying it across other verticals we are in, be it health, as an example, I think we will be where we will deliver value in the long run. Ruth Porat : And as much as we're extremely excited about the long-term implications for quantum computing, part of your question there about our near term computing requirements. Given our outlook in particular across Google, we do expect to see ongoing demand for compute investments to support our growth, particularly for machine learning, Cloud, Search and YouTube. And the primary driver of the CapEx does continue to be our expectations for compute requirements, so investments in technical infrastructure, as we've talked about today. Operator : And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Thanks. I need a Google headset. Sundar, just on investments in GCP, you're in a really unique situation, having built infrastructure and productivity applications. Can you just walk through how you prioritize the two big buckets? There's a lot of different ways you can go in GCP. And just want to follow up with Ruth. You alluded to some G Suite pricing changes. And I know there were some prices that were changed earlier in the year. And I was just curious if you were referring to that price change or earlier in the year or if there was something new? Sundar Pichai : I mean, you're right. I mean, these are two big buckets and we treat them that way. Obviously, we've talked a lot about GCP, but G Suite continues to be very differentiated. And, we just announced a new leader Javier Soltero coming in with lots of experience to turbo-charge this area as well. And in general, there are many G Suite customers now with who we are having GCP conversations and vice versa. So, I think in general, given we have a big go-to-market effort, the breadth you have allows us to have more conversations and engage through many different paths into the organization. So, it's very synergistic as well. Ruth Porat : And in terms of the G Suite pricing, I was referencing the pricing that we announced back in April. It's all outlined in a blog post. Our view was, it was the right time to increase prices, given the ongoing functionality and tools that are included within G Suite. And as I said, what we're seeing here is in addition to the benefit from the price change. We also continue to have nice seat growth. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Justin Post : I think I\u2019ll ask on YouTube, could you talk a little bit about your high level OTT viewing strategy? Obviously, subscriptions are growing. Maybe give us an update on how your YouTube subscription product is doing versus expectations? And then, on the paid click growth, it decelerated 18%, anything to call out there, especially related to YouTube, any change to coverage going on or anything we should know about? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Subscription is an area we are different definitely excited about. We are pleased with our options so far across both, YouTube Music and YouTube Premium. They're now available in 71 countries from five markets at the start of 2018. So, we are definitely scaling that up and we're seeing great traction. YouTube TV is also doing well. I think, we just announced that PBS is coming to YouTube TV in July. Last month, we announced YouTube TV is now launching on select Amazon Fire TV devices. So, there's definite -- the user satisfaction on the product is high. And so, we are focused on continuing our expansion, building out a great service and building awareness for the service. So, overall, I think, engaging users with premium offerings on YouTube is the focus for us. And the efforts, while early, are definitely showing strong traction. Ruth Porat : And then, you asked about click growth and the trend there, the biggest driver affecting the click trends continues to be the growth of YouTube engagement ads. As in the first and second quarter, the rate of YouTube click growth decelerated in the third quarter. That does continue to reflect the changes that we made in early 2018 to really improve the user and advertiser experience. And as we've talked about on prior calls, that did have an impact on click growth. But as we also talked about, they weren't related to those changes in 2018. We're not related to policy enforcement actions that YouTube, they had a negligible impact on YouTube revenues. So, not a read through. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any closing remarks. Ellen West : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call. Thank you again and have a good evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ellen West : Thank you, Candice. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat. Now, I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, performance and operations, and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward-looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. And now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Ellen, and good afternoon everyone. It\u2019s a privilege to join the call as the CEO of both Alphabet and Google after four years as CEO of Google. I\u2019d like to start by thanking Larry and Sergey for giving all of us at Google a timeless machine, enduring values and an opportunity to have an impact on the world. There\u2019s a lot I want to cover today, and I also want to leave plenty of time for any questions you may have for me and Ruth.  As you have seen in our press release, we\u2019ve added new revenue disclosures to give greater insight into our business. Search and other Google properties continue to drive great results with total revenues in 2019 of $98 billion and strong growth. I\u2019m also really pleased with two of our newer growth areas. YouTube reached $15 billion in ads revenues in 2019 growing at 36%, compared with 2018, and it now has over 20 million music and premium paid subscribers and over 2 million YouTube TV paid subscribers, ending 2019 at a $3 billion annual run rate in YouTube subscriptions and other non-advertising revenues. Google Cloud ended 2019 at a more than $10 billion run rate, up 53% year-on-year, driven by significant growth in GCP. The growth rate of GCP was meaningful higher than that of Cloud overall and GCP\u2019s growth rate accelerated from 2018 to 2019. Before I talk about the highlights of the quarter, I want to take a step back and give some early thoughts about my approach to managing Alphabet and Other Bets. We\u2019ve always taken a long-term view investing in deep computer science and technology. Important trends like the wider adoption and application of artificial intelligence, ambient computing, and the move to the Cloud underline our investments across Google and our other Alphabet companies. Our work in healthcare is a great example of how our investments in these areas allows us to deliver solutions across an entire sector. Ruth Porat : Thanks, Sundar. We\u2019re very pleased with our strong 2019 results with total alphabet revenues of $162 billion, up 18% year-on-year or 20% in constant currency. In dollar terms, this represents an increase of $25 billion in revenues relative to 2018. I will review our quarterly and annual results, including our new revenue disclosures and conclude with our outlook. Sundar and I will then take your questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Hi. Thank you very much Sundar and Ruth and I guess, I'm sure you're going to hear this a million times tonight, but thank you so much for the enhanced disclosure of, I think this is the best Google call or Alphabet call I have been on since I\u2019ve covered the company. So, thank you again. You\u2019ve given us a lot of stuff here. I just wanted to focus a little bit on GCP and the comments that you made and either if you want to think about this for Google Cloud collectively or just for GCP, just given the revenue run rate that you are at, how do we think about the gross margin profile of this business, is it fair to look at some of the other Cloud players when they were disclosing similar run rates to get a sense for what their gross margins were? Or is there a reason why your business might look slightly different? Thank you so much again. Ruth Porat : Thank you for those comments. First and foremost, we\u2019re obviously really pleased with the momentum here. GCP had fantastic revenue momentum in the fourth quarter and as we noted is growing at a meaningfully higher pace than Google Cloud overall. In terms of your margin question, look, I think our view is obviously the competitive dynamics and the Cloud market are very different today. We are investing aggressively given the opportunity which I tried to make clear in opening comments. Given the opportunity we see and the momentum we\u2019re having, we\u2019ve accelerated our investment in our go-to-market team and as we\u2019ve talked about before we\u2019ve set a goal to triple the size of the sales force. We\u2019re also focused on building out our product road map and extending the global footprint of our infrastructure. And I will leave the forecasting to you. Heather Bellini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan : Thank you so much. Maybe two parts if I can. Sundar, to you first \u2013 a lot of innovation that company put on display over the past year, Ruth talked in her sort of forward commentary section about sustainability of growth and outperformance going forward. What are you most excited about when you see the company trying to align, what improves consumer utility along with what continues to drive growth in the various segments of the business? That would be number one, and two, Ruth maybe for you, you had talked about variability of revenue last quarter going into Q4, but unless I missed that, I don\u2019t think you used the same word again in Q4, what were you expecting in terms of variability in Q4 and any color you could give on how that played out or how we should be thinking about variability of revenue going forward? Thank you so much. Sundar Pichai : Eric, I think overall, I presume you're meaning across everything we do, and if that\u2019s the case, I am \u2013 I mean the trends we are seeing and we\u2019ve been investing on it for a while, but applying it and actually driving used cases to users. So, for example, you know using AI to dramatically improve natural language processing to make 10% of our search results better is a kind of opportunity I\u2019m excited by. When I look at \u2013 we do see a lot of commercial experiences across our properties, be it Search or YouTube and the opportunity to create a better experience there and hence bring more value to our users. That\u2019s something which we see as a big opportunity. And across our businesses be it YouTube, Cloud, Play, or hardware in addition to search, you know we are seeing strength in a lot of these areas and we share a common technological approach across all of them. And so that gives us a synergistic way to approach these areas as well. Ruth Porat : Ruth Porat : And then on your second question, at our scale, we're pleased with the rate of growth in 2019 here in Search and our ads business overall and we do see ample opportunity ahead. When we talk about variability of revenue, the way we've talked about it in the past very much holds true, which is where we don't manage for any particular quarter. We manage focused on what's in the best for users and with a lot of testing that goes around it. And so really the point is there will be variability and we're focused on continued \u2013 the continued long-term opportunity and we do see that opportunity, the ads opportunity to be significant. Apart from the secular shift to digital, we continue to be very focused on the benefit from better measurement, better ad delivery, better user experience, our view is that all helps grow the addressable market, but there will be variability over time because we're very focused on what's in the right long-term interest. Eric Sheridan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Doug Anmuth : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, first, just hope you could talk more about Google Cloud. Great to see the $10 billion run rate. Just curious if you can help gauge the progress over the past year, and then where do you think the biggest areas of differentiation-why in an increasingly competitive space? And then Ruth, can you just give some of your latest thoughts on balancing growth and profitability across the Google segment and Other Bets? And as you enter this year, do you see additional opportunities to drive increased profitability without impacting the long-term potential of the businesses? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Doug, on Cloud, I think maybe a few thoughts on some of the progress we made last year and talk about the differentiation, which you asked about as well. Definitely under Thomas' leadership, I think we have clearly focused on six industry verticals across 21 markets and so doubling down on those efforts, bringing in a lot of new products and compliance certification, so effectively expanding the TAM, which we serve. Ruth mentioned, the team is on track to triple our sales force in three years, including bringing in a number of senior strategic hires and supplementing it with a channel partnership program. I think the progress I've seen in our customer focus \u2013 with our customer success organization and the contracting framework have all been great progress for us. Overall, every time we are, especially in one of these larger deals, they are effectively looking for a technology partner. So, differentiation is not just what we bring to table in terms of Cloud, where we have differentiated capabilities, but in many cases, it's what we bring as Google. So, if you take an area like healthcare, all the investments we are making in healthcare across Google, and in some cases, Alphabet. If you look at Sabre, the partnership we can bring to them across our experience working in travel verticals as well. So, I think \u2013 and over time, I also think the AI-based, industry-specific solutions we are working on will end up being a differentiating factor as well. Ruth Porat : And in terms of your second question, investing for growth and how we balance growth and profitability, the approach to capital allocation and the pace of investing continues to be guided by the same three drivers that we've talked about previously. First and most important is investing to support the long-term earnings growth and the opportunities that we see there. Second, we do remain focused on optimizing investments within each product area. And then third, as we've talked about on prior calls, is investing to support operational excellence and that includes things like driving efficiencies in our technical infrastructure, which I spoke about. When we look at the biggest investment areas within Google, we, as we've talked about already on this call, continue to be focused on investing to support the growth that we see. It starts with Search, while also investing to build new businesses and we've talked about a couple of them already today. Cloud is clearly an area where we're investing aggressively. In Hardware, we've been investing heavily by developing our capabilities in hardware engineering, as well as building out supply and physical distribution chains. And then in YouTube, as I mentioned in opening comments, we do continue to build out our subscription services. It's still in the early days there and we're making a sizable investment to build it out, taking a long-term view here. So, we are leaning into investing for long-term growth. That's been a core principle here and remains such while looking at where can we optimize within portfolios and where can operational efficiencies be additive. Doug Anmuth : Great. Thank you both. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my question. I have two. Just, Sundar, I thought your 2020 focal points are really helpful, creating the most helpful products for everyone and then the most trusted experience for users. I was curious to kind of focus in those comments on payments in YouTube. You've had a lot of payment strategies over the last couple of years. So, talk about what types of investments or products you think you need to really remove friction and drive better payment adoption. And then on the YouTube side, if you sort of look at how people are using YouTube now from an engagement perspective, what types of changes do you foresee you need to make in order to really make it a more helpful product to drive engagement even higher on the YouTube platform? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Brian thanks. On the payment side, clearly I spoke earlier about the kind of experiences people see across our properties, including people do come with an intent to discover, learn and commercially engage as well, and when they're looking to transact, payments ends up playing a critical role. So the less friction you have, it tends to work better. So, we've been really focused on doing that and getting more of our users set up in the right state. We've had a lot of traction with our payments product over the past 18 months. We had a tremendously successful launch in India from which we learnt a lot of features, and we are bringing that and we are revamping our payments products globally. And so I'm excited by that rollout, which is coming up in 2020. I think that will make the experience better. On the YouTube side, I guess your question is about how are users engaging with the product. Overall, all our user metrics are very strong. They're global in nature and increasingly we see newer verticals beginning to grow as well. So, YouTube is working horizontally well at scale. And for us, it's making sure, as an ecosystem, it works better so that the content there, the experiences there are improving. We take our content responsibility work seriously, which makes more content creators engaged and makes it a more valuable product for advertisers as well. But also supplementing the content you see there with other types of accessorizing things, be it merchandising, ticket sales. When we make it contextually relevant, what we have done in Search and search ads over time, if we can bring that to YouTube when we see an opportunity, I think that sets us up well for the long term there. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Thanks. Ruth, in North America, was there anything that was abnormally unusual? Facebook had cited some weakness in North America. It looks like your North America number was relatively weak versus the last four years. Is there \u2013 was there any anomaly that we should be aware of? Thank you. Ruth Porat : Thanks for that. So, the regional breakdown also reflects product mix within regions. The U.S. year-on-year growth rate does reflect a decline in Hardware revenues relative to what was a fairly strong Hardware revenue growth rate in 4Q 2018 and not much more to call out than that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Stephen Ju : Thank you. So, Sundar I guess some of the more cross product line synergies are showing up in an integrated software and hardware effort with the stuff like the Pixel, but you've come up through the ranks at Google, so you're undoubtedly pretty sensitive to the various interests across various teams, but we're wondering what you may be looking to do to break down, I guess, what might have been more of a siloed effort in Google's history? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : I think \u2013 I spoke about execution at scale. And so for us that means, you have these product areas, which are focused on their users, but we are setting up teams which cut across all these areas and make sure they can bring their synergies and work at scale. So, last year, we set up a core infrastructure team, which looks at things like how does the user journey work across, what does the shared infrastructure engineers can use so that we don't reinvent the wheel in multiple areas, how can we commonly deploy AI across all these products? So, I think that's been a good example of bringing teams together. Another big area where we invested like that to break down silos is our partnerships. We set up a global partnerships team. And our ability to bring a common Google perspective to our big global partners has helped us strike many new partnerships. I mentioned Activision Blizzard as an example. And they work and they're very synergistic with Cloud as well. To my point earlier, when people engage with us on Cloud, they're looking for \u2013 they're interested in a bigger digital transformation across the board. Google Assistant is a great example of \u2013 because we are focused on the user and the experience cuts across several of our product areas. It's been a great mechanism, by which we can break down silos as well, but it's a great question and I spend a lot of time on it. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Dan Salmon : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I had two questions. One clarifying one for Ruth and then maybe a big picture one for Sundar. Ruth, you distinguished between the growth of brand advertising and direct response on YouTube. Those comments were very clear. I just want to follow up and ask you just, how you make that distinction between brand and direct response. Is it different pricing model? Is it the presence of ad revenue share with a creator or both? Would just be curious on that distinction? And then to Sundar, the big picture one, we have heard others in the ecosystem talk about headwinds from targeting growing. Certainly, there are regulatory changes that also apply to you. You've made some changes to various Google advertising platforms. And of course, you're an owner of two of the largest, most important platforms in Chrome and the Android operating system. I could ask you a billion things on that last one, but what I'd really like to ask is the big picture question, if we roll up these sort of things for your total advertising business, how important are changes here to your top line growth? Are you seeing notable headwinds from these types of changes in the ecosystem as well? Thanks. Ruth Porat : So, on the first one, we have again this quarter talked about brand and direct response. And as we've talked about in prior quarters, brand is growing at a healthy pace and remains the largest component of YouTube ads. Direct response is growing \u2013 continues to grow at a very substantial growth. The distinction here is the format for \u2013 in direct response, we're letting brands insert a tailored call to action in a video ad, such as signing up for a newsletter or scheduling an appointment or downloading an app or booking a trip, things of those sort. That's why it's the direct response category. Sundar Pichai : And on the broader questions about headwinds, it's something we always need to take a look at. We try to stay focused on users and our partners and we realize for these things to scale, you need to make sure the ecosystem is working well. And so we are engaged in these issues and we anticipate and structurally work on them early on. So, it's how we broadly approach these things. And so there's nothing notable to call out other than there will be continued changes in these ecosystems and our ability to anticipate and adapt is key to the years ahead. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. I'd like to ask a couple of bigger picture things on the new disclosures. So, first on YouTube monetization, assuming you have about 2 billion users, it's about $7 or $8 per user. Just wondering how you feel about that monetization level given all the usage you're seeing there, and is there significant room to raise that when you compare it to other social networks? And then secondly, on the Cloud backlog, a very strong number at , versus our IaaS/PaaS revenue rates, just wondering about how strong the new deals have been that you've signed in the last six months? It sounds like really good traction there, and then the profitability of these deals, how do you feel about that? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On the question on YouTube, I do think there is a lot of opportunity ahead. You're right; it's a platform working at scale. I think \u2013 Ruth spoke a little bit about brand and direct response. I think direct response is a huge growth area for us. And increasingly, I think when you look at the fact that people are consuming a lot of goods and services as part of their experience in YouTube, how can we create better commerce experiences also is a big opportunity for us. So, looking across, I think, there is more room, significantly more room, over the mid to long term on monetization levels. And so I think we see that as a big opportunity and are investing for it. On Cloud, definitely we are increasingly doing much larger deals. And these deals can sometimes span beyond Cloud as well and they can touch many areas. So as an example, if you're an automotive company, we can be talking to you across Cloud, Android Auto, in some cases, Waymo, and they all happen to be strong platforms \u2013 partners on the advertising side as well. So, these are large deals, and we do want to build these in a sustainable way so that we can serve the partner well, and so profitability has been something we are very focused on as well. Ruth Porat : And just to add a little more to that, where the $11.4 billion backlog number is for us, we view it as a way to quantify the traction that we're having. And as you know well, in the enterprise phase, these tend to grow over time, and profitability as such comes across the cohorts. However, the point that we were trying to make and have made a couple of times here on the call is we are investing aggressively in Cloud overall given the opportunity that we see and the momentum we're having and we'll continue to do so. Justin Post : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Youssef Squali from SunTrust. Your line is now open. Youssef Squali : Okay. Great. Thank you. Two quick ones. First, Ruth, has the shortened holiday season had much of an impact on your Search business in North America? And then, Sundar, as you talk about automation, machine learning, AI, how much of advertisers' search spend is now on auto bidding? And how do you think smart bidding is effective \u2013 is affecting spending growth and pricing? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So, on the holiday shopping season, there is really nothing to highlight there. What we find is there are seasonal puts and takes in any given period, so really nothing to note. Sundar Pichai : On \u2013 I don't have specific numbers here, but \u2013 to add here, but effectively, we do see significant traction in these areas and advertisers are leveraging the features we have, we are bringing it here, be it smart bidding, auto bidding, there's tremendous traction with our advertisers here. Youssef Squali : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Rippey from Evercore. Your line is now open. Kevin Rippey : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is primarily for Sundar. As you think about the risk profile of some of your businesses like Waymo, like Verily in healthcare, how do you manage those risks, which likely in a scenario where autonomous cars have some accident or something like that, having those in-house and perhaps brand damage that could do to Google versus what you could do if those were entirely separate enterprises? I know they're all held underneath the Alphabet umbrella, but just sort of big picture how you think about managing that risk over time? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Kevin. We are \u2013 as I spoke earlier in the remarks, part of the reason we are making sure we are investing in the proper governance structures so that we don't try to scale as a management across these important areas. Some of these are \u2013 have regulatory aspects to it. We are, for some of these bets as well, and Verily is a great example, we have brought in outside investors, people with expertise and setting up proper board structures and governance for these. So, I think those all help and we'll continue to evaluate these on a periodic basis and bring that rigor and discipline, but I do think Alphabet gives us a more flexible framework, if you will, to both have the independence when we need, but where we can have common shared synergies, like our AI investments, bring that to bear as well. Kevin Rippey : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is now open. Ben Wheeler : Hi. This is Ben on for Mark. Thanks for taking the question. Ruth, I just kind of want to double click on something you said before in terms of Other Bets kind of like a sharpening focus on the allocation there. Was that kind of \u2013 is that kind of signaling more of the same or is that kind of potentially maybe prioritizing investments more toward like share buybacks and stuff like that as opposed to \u2013 like basically I'm trying to ask should we expect greater rationalization in the Other Bets segment going forward or is it more of the same? Thanks a lot. Ruth Porat : So, what I was saying is that when we look at the Other Bets and execution, we've talked over time about measuring them against specific metrics and milestones, operating, business, technology, financial performance. And we look at that as we calibrate the pace of investment, the approach to investments and we are continuing to do that. We're putting a sharper focus on this, as Sundar indicated, looking at where does it make sense to work with external capital as we did with Verily as an example, but the bigger point is, we continue to invest for the long term, and when we look at our capital return approach, it's very consistent with what we've talked about previously. The primary use of capital continues to be to support long-term growth in Google and in Other Bets, and then it's about strategic investments and on top of that return of capital to shareholders. Ben Wheeler : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is now open. Ross Sandler : Hi. Yes, two questions. The Google segment margin looked really strong in the fourth quarter. I think this is the first time that mix shift actually helped you guys from a margin perspective. So Ruth, can you just talk about how much of that margin increase year-on-year was from the Hardware business dropping off versus improving elsewhere? And then as you look forward, you mentioned that headcount is going to accelerate in 2020. So, is this an investment year in your view or just kind of more of the steady kind of increase? And then second question, on YouTube a lot of discussion here about direct response impact and the opportunity there. What percent of AdWords advertisers are buying Search only versus buying Search and YouTube at this stage? And it looks like from your new disclosure that YouTube decelerated a little bit in the fourth quarter. Any color on what's driving that relative to the full year 2019 growth rate? Thank you. Ruth Porat : Okay. So, taking the first part of that. In terms of the operating margin in the fourth quarter, there were a number of discrete items in the fourth quarter last year in 2018. So that did result in a favorable Google op inc year-on-year comparison for this year. And as you said, the other cost of sales does reflect lower expenses related to Hardware in Q4, in particular, versus last year, but I think the main point to leave you with is that we do intend to continue to invest aggressively to support growth in the areas that we've already talked about quite a bit on this call, in Search, in Cloud, in Hardware and in YouTube. In terms of headcount, I tried to break it out in my closing comments that it starts with those areas \u2013 putting headcount behind the areas where we're investing for the long term. And then we have a couple of additional factors that are somewhat expected to boost the year-on-year growth rate. One is bringing some support in-house that's OpEx neutral, and the other is the Fitbit acquisition. In terms of the third part of your question, I'm just trying to recall it. The \u2013 in terms of the mix, I'm not sure there's much to add there. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is now open. Colin Sebastian : Thank you. I guess, first, just given the focus and new leadership team in commerce, was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the opportunities you see for innovation there at the transactional part of the funnel. And then as a quick follow-up on the acceleration in GCP, beyond the size of the deals, were there particular product areas like BigQuery or something else worth calling out that might have inflected to drive that acceleration? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Great. On commerce, I'm really excited Bill Ready is here. He brings a lot of experience. And he mentioned the transactional part of the funnel and I think it's an area where he brings a lot of experience given his prior work, but we definitely see opportunity to improve the overall user experience in terms of how we present our results, the visual nature of it, making that experience more delightful. And when people are interested in something, how do you make it more seamless to complete the transaction and bringing in deep partnerships with merchants and retailers to making that happen. So, excited about the opportunity there and that's where we are investing. On GCP, we did see \u2013 it's been a lot to do with bringing to bear all the resources we have and engaging well on these deals and the execution there has been great. And it's \u2013 definitely, we see strong traction in data analytics. And so, our strength there as a company is definitely contributing significantly, as well as our overall leadership in AI. Colin Sebastian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any further remarks. Ellen West : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2020 conference call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jim Friedland : Thank you, Candice. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. When I last spoke with you in early February, no one could have imagined how much the world would change and how suddenly. Our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by COVID-19, especially those who have lost loved ones or their livelihoods. It\u2019s a challenging moment for the world. Through it all, we are incredibly grateful for all of the essential workers on the frontline of this crisis. From healthcare workers and first responders, to the grocery store clerks and delivery workers, to teachers grappling with new technology to help children learn remotely, to all the scientists and researchers working hard to develop vaccines and treatments, and many others who are leading through these difficult times. Thank you. These people fill us with hope and show us the power of human resilience. We\u2019ll need that energy and resolve in the months and years ahead. Today, there is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the path to recovery. But there are some things that we can understand better with the patterns we are seeing. For example, it\u2019s clear from data that people are being more cautious and are seeking authoritative advice and guidance to protect their family\u2019s health and safety. A return to normal economic activity depends on how effectively societies manage the spread of the virus. There is no one-size-fits-all, and the timing and pace of recovery will vary from location to location. This is a long-term effort. It\u2019s also clear that this is the first major pandemic taking place in a digital world. Many parts of the economy are also able to continue with some semblance of normalcy. Thanks to advances in remote work, online shopping, delivery options, home entertainment and telemedicine. At the same time, newer technologies like AI, Bluetooth exposure notifications and 3D printing are being used to help fight the disease head on. Ruth Porat : Thanks, Sundar. Our results for the first quarter are a tail of 2 quarters with strong results across our revenue lines for January and February followed by an abrupt decline in March in our advertising revenues, as governments globally instituted stay at home orders in response to COVID-19. At the same time, even through March, our non-advertising revenue lines maintain their strong performance, particularly Google Cloud. I\u2019ll provide more details on the impact of the crisis as I review the Google segment revenue results and conclude with an update to the outlook that I shared on our fourth quarter call. Sundar and I will then your questions. Operator : Thank you.  And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question and hope all is safe and well with everyone on the team there at Alphabet. 2 questions if I can. One, on the comment with respect to direct response advertising on YouTube, would love to get a little more color on how direct response advertising\u2019s ad units continued to evolve and perform, and how advertisers are using those ad units as part of their broader advertising goals. And then maybe, Ruth, for you, on the comment on expenses, just want to understand a little bit of how much of what your messaging on expenses is efficiency gains that you were aiming for in 2020 before we got to COVID-19 versus elements of the cost structure that you\u2019re reexamining as a result of the pandemic. Thanks so much. Sundar Pichai : Eric, thanks, thanks for the wishes. On YouTube direct response, we\u2019ve definitely seen traction there. I think an area where it really works well for example is app installs, it\u2019s a great example of it. Gaming is another good example of it. And we are working on iterating and making the format work better, so that it applies to more contexts as well. But, in general, I think businesses are learning to adapt. Obviously, we\u2019ve had great success with Search and so we\u2019re bringing a lot of those learnings and we\u2019re sharing it with our customers. And so, we expect to see more traction there over time. Ruth Porat : And on your second question, I like the way you framed it. Yes, we do have efficiency efforts that we started, that we had going as we enter this year. But as a result of what we\u2019re seeing in the environment, our view was that we should really double-down on those. And so, when we go through the various areas that I mentioned, we had started the year with an expectation about really optimizing headcount around the various areas. What we\u2019ve determined is we\u2019re going to at this point slow the pace of hiring. To be very clear, we are continuing to hire, but we are slowing the pace of hiring. And that\u2019s helping as we\u2019re driving a deeper look into how do you optimize within each area. The same is true for example in some of the comments on marketing. We are continuing to invest in marketing. As you know well, sales and marketing line, the majority of it is headcount related and we do continue to invest here in ads, and in particular, in Cloud. As it relates to the marketing component, namely ads and promo spend, we did reduce it relative to our plans in the beginning of the year. And we continue to have a healthy budget for ads and promo, particularly in digital to support many business areas. But as with the other areas of investment, we\u2019re really focused on optimizing across products and services. And with physical events canceled for much of the year, marketing spend is also reduced. And so, that\u2019s another example. With machines and servers, we\u2019ve been focused on efficiency of the fleet for some time now. This is giving us the opportunity to push that even further. So we\u2019re looking at the operating environment and saying we should continue to lean into the efficiency programs. We can. It does help us free up some resources for the growth areas that continue to be a priority, but it is an accentuation of where we were. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Doug Anmuth : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar, one for Ruth. First, Sundar, you just talked about how once the crisis has passed, the world will not look the same. I\u2019m curious if you can just elaborate a little bit more on how you think Alphabet comes out stronger on the other side of this downturn. And then, Ruth, maybe taking the question on expenses a little bit further, did this give you any more opportunity to be even more disciplined or diligent on costs on the other side as well? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Doug. It\u2019s a good question. And we are thinking deeply about it as well. In general, I would say the highest level opportunity is, across everywhere we see, businesses thinking deeper about the shift to digital. And that\u2019s true across marketing, cloud, in \u2013 every place we see that trend. And so part of this is making sure our investments deliver value with respect to that shift. So if you look at advertising, people who in the past may have debated things like how do I get virtual showrooming, now are really thinking about it. People who may have been hesitant to shift their budgets, do \u2013 are looking through moments like this and trying to get all that working better. Cloud is an obvious area, every company has been thinking about digital transformation. But they are asking the questions deeper. For example, if you have data centers, there are fixed costs through something like this. And you learn going through moment like that and you\u2019re thinking about the opportunity harder. So across everything we do, be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Play, be it Cloud, I think we are investing to capitalize on this long term opportunity. And I would say overall on Alphabet as well when you look at investments like a Waymo and Wing, you can imagine in the future these things working well can play a significant role. And even in the limited area   we clearly saw its potential through a moment like this, so we\u2019re betting on those big trends. Ruth Porat : And to your other question, if I understand it correctly, you\u2019re asking about the durability of some of the efficiency efforts. I think that the way I would answer that is, after a decade of growth there have to be opportunities for added efficiency. And we\u2019ve been focused on that for some time. But painful times like this put a spotlight on an urgency around taking \u2013 making sure you\u2019re focused on the levers that you have. And hopefully, those instill the right kinds of health metrics et cetera against which you\u2019re managing. So I would say that the intent most certainly is that these are durable investments to ensure that we\u2019re operating as effectively and efficiently as we can be. And I just need to reiterate. And Sundar and I have both said this. We remain committed to investing for the long term, so we\u2019re not compromising where we need to invest for long-term growth. We\u2019re trying to make sure that each dollar of investment is well managed. Doug Anmuth : Thank you, both. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Ruth, I have 2 questions for you actually. First, I wanted to thank you for the color around the growth you\u2019re seeing as you were exiting the quarter in the ad business. And there\u2019s been some signs from different partners or different companies that ad spending whilst down considerably has actually improved a little bit, maybe some green-shoots from the declines that you might have been referencing at the end of March. Any chance you can give us a sense of the type of growth you\u2019ve been seeing for the first kind of 3, 4 weeks for the quarter, just to help level set us. And then, just in regards to the provision you mentioned in G&A related to credit deterioration, is there a chance you could tell us the amount of that provision? And do you expect to have to do this again in the second quarter? Thank you. Ruth Porat : Thank you for the \u2013 so, in terms of ads revenue, as I said in opening comments, for our ads business a key signal to monitor is macroeconomic performance, which has tended to be correlated with ad spend. And I think it\u2019s premature for me to comment on the trend. In terms of what we saw in the first quarter, as I said, for Search and other revenues, they were up 9% year-on-year for the quarter. But in March, revenues began to decline and then ended the month at a mid-teens percentage decline in year-on-your revenues. And then, with YouTube, we had strong revenue growth until late in the quarter when trajectories for direct response and brand diverged. And as I said, direct response does continue to have substantial growth throughout the quarter while brand began to experience a sizable headwind starting in mid-March. So by the end of March total YouTube ads revenue growth had decelerated to year-on-year growth rate in the high-single-digits. And then, for the second quarter so far, you know what, I think it\u2019s premature to gauge, given uncertainty in the environment. And a few weeks, obviously, is not a quarter. So in such an unprecedented crisis, I would not want you to extrapolate from just a couple of weeks. That being said, the decline in our Search and other ads revenue was abrupt in March and although we\u2019re seeing some early signs at this point that users are returning to more commercial behavior, it\u2019s not clear how durable or monetizeable that will be. So based on our estimates from the end of March through last week for Search, we haven\u2019t seen further deterioration in the percentage of year-on-year revenue declines. For YouTube, direct response has remained strong. However, we\u2019ve seen a continued decline in brand advertising and it\u2019s really too early to add more. I think that the main point though is a few weeks obviously is not a quarter and given it is such an unprecedented environment, I would not extrapolate from these comments for the full quarter. And then I\u2019m sorry you had the second question on the\u2026 Heather Bellini : On the G&A, sorry, no, that was very helpful so thank you on behalf of everybody. And then just the G&A that you mentioned the credit provisions that you said you took, I just was wondering if you could share the amount it might be in the queue later tonight, but wondering if you could share with us the amount on the call? Ruth Porat : It will be in the queue later tonight. Heather Bellini : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson, your line is now open. Michael Nathanson : Thanks. I have one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, people have asked you about your priorities you talked about, but I wonder if you could step back and think about what this crisis will do the other side and maybe a reorienting of your priorities so perhaps where you would shift spend in the long-term to maybe take advantage of where this is going? And then Ruth we appreciate the color on YouTube, just want to dig in some more, if you can give us any sense of YouTube geographies is there any difference by change by geography that is really helpful? So, thanks. Sundar Pichai : In terms of overall priorities, I would say, we\u2019ve always taken a long-term \u2013 on thinking through the arc of where things are going and our deep focus on AI, it\u2019s an example of that and we\u2019ve been convinced for a while that those trends will play out in the long-term and so if anything through moments like that, the strong foundation we have built allows us to continue to be able to invest in our long-term area so AI is a good example of it. The shift over time on computing to ambient computing is something we\u2019re going to be deeply committed to and continue to invest there. Cloud and productivity software for businesses of all sizes is a deep area of investment and so the thesis still main so we continue to focus anywhere we think the actual work we are doing is based on deep technology, deep computing, a deep computational scale is the kind of investments we think still stand the test of time through things like, but beyond that we are actively looking at how user patterns are emerging so, for example, e-commerce is an area and you saw us respond through this with the changes we announced on our shopping property and going for comprehensiveness there and with new leaders in place we\u2019re going to be making sure we work on the user experience there. And so we are looking at shifts be it videoconferencing with Google Meet and G Suite and adapting and investing in those areas as well so that\u2019s how we are approaching it. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of the geographic breakdown for You Tube, we kind of bring that down, although I think as you know, well, we have a breakdown for the major regions around the world and to give you a little more color there, in mid February revenue growth across the business began to decelerate in APAC, although as I noted the decline in APAC was more muted just given the uneven impact of COVID and the nature of our business across the region and then the impact in EMEA was first evident in mid February with a steeper falloff in March. In the second week of March we then saw results in the U.S. as well as other Americas fall off shortly, but nothing more specific by product. Michael Nathanson : Okay. Thank you, Ruth. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Ruth, just to go back to your comments around the early signs of improvements in behavior and search, I know it\u2019s early in doing over extrapolate, but just any more detail on the types of behavior you\u2019re seeing, which verticals or which categories or which geographies were you seeing sort of the first sign of green shoots on the Search side. And then Sundar, just to go back to your comments about the shift toward digital opportunities or digital transformation, if you talk to us about as you sort of look back over the last couple years at what you\u2019ve done on the SMB side and what are sort of one or two of the key hurdles where you see you really need to invest and build more comprehensive SMB products for post recovery? Sundar Pichai : Maybe I can give color both on the SMB and a bit on that side too. On the SMB side, it\u2019s an area we have been investing for a while and obviously we have assets both across AdWords, Google Maps, Google My Business and obviously providing them with G Suite and the tools to get their business running. So, I do think we have a lot of touch points, but the focus has been simplifying it, making it more of a one cohesive easy experience making sure it works well from mobile that there is a truly lighter weight AdWords experience so that they can get on board it quicker and so reducing the work they need to and also over time bringing technologies like AI to just make it all much simpler and seamless for them. And it\u2019s going to be a continued focus for us and especially scaling this up and making sure it works internationally well as well we have clear metrics and targets internally and we are aligning the teams better to get there and you would see us do more. On the Ad side, a question \u2013 to your question about maybe I can give more qualitative cover to what was said earlier and we \u2013 the good thing about search ads and direct response on YouTube as well, but Search primarily is that, it\u2019s an extraordinarily effective system, it\u2019s a transparent system, you have a very clear sense of ROI, it\u2019s very measurable, highly cost-effective and so we have always seen and we saw this in 2008 as well, people respond in the short-term, but the recovery is also fast when it comes back and so it tends to work. It is very diversified not just geographically by different verticals and even through moments like that we do see businesses responding to demand shift and so we see through our system if people suddenly are looking for office furniture or even pajamas, the system response, right and so you see the dynamic nature of it. I mentioned earlier people are really thinking about the shift to digital so Philip and our ads team are super engaged with our customers helping them think through the opportunities through moments like that. I gave a earlier example, if you are thinking about cars and you\u2019ve been hesitant to do virtual car showrooming, now is the time you\u2019re beginning to have those conversations in a deeper way. There are budgets, which are shifting in certain cases, some of our large customers, may be they\u2019ve spent a lot of money on live sports that is clearly on hold so they\u2019re looking to shift some of those budgets into opportunities they see, but having said that there are large sectors of the economy, which are affected, things like travel and our large partners and customers are impacted and so we clearly see the impact of that and that\u2019s the color Ruth gave as well. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks, Sundar. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. I\u2019m curious if you could just give us a little more color across SMB and enterprise, any common threads you saw between those two segments? Sundar Pichai : We have had tremendous momentum on the G Suite and we can \u2013 all of Google works this way, products like Gmail, Google Docs that are built from the ground up to really help people be productive and collaborative in a distributed work environment and so we\u2019re clearly seeing traction there. Google Meet, have seen great traction and I gave \u2013 I mentioned some user momentum there, but we have more announcements coming up including later this week and so we are seeing tremendous traction and engagement on G Suite. On Cloud, the shift to digital has been deep trend and if anything people are really engaged on it. I earlier talked about, you can imagine, if you\u2019re a customer and you have data centers, these are fixed cost when you go through moments like this and so people are really looking at opportunities there and so our teams are super engaged, but I do want to acknowledge, maybe small businesses across the world are deeply impacted. As a company we have announced several efforts to support small and medium businesses and we are going to be deeply engaged with them, but I think it\u2019s a tough journey we are all on and we look forward to working with them to help them through this. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Dan Salmon : Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, I wanted to return to those long-term initiatives that you walked through earlier and one that was most close to your core business and the changes that you \u2013 were announced this week for shopping. Could you explain a little bit more about the reasons for making those changes and expanding the free listings or creating the free listings and what drove you to make that decision now? And then a related follow up for Ruth, same question essentially, but as we think about the financial impact of such a change, imagine this is one of those things, which may qualify as causing maybe some variability in the quarter-to-quarter rate, but something that benefits all parties over the long-term, I think is how we\u2019ve often visited these sorts of changes, but any color you could add on sort of the near and long-term impact of the Google Shopping changes would be great too? Sundar Pichai : So, going through a moment like this, it\u2019s very clear, part of what makes Google work well is, people come across a diverse range of needs and that\u2019s true for shopping. They spend time discovering and comprehensiveness really matters that\u2019s how we can have a great user experience and so as we\u2019ve been thinking about this space, we realize and this is how our organic search works, for us to truly give that comprehensiveness and the quality of experience. We need the widest catalog possible and then we are good at ranking it and providing and matching users to what they are looking for. And so it is \u2013 it made a lot of sense for us and just looking through the range of experiences people who are seeking through the COVID pandemic validated it even more and obviously we\u2019ve been executing really hard there with leadership in place and so we saw the opportunity to go back to our first principles and improve the comprehensiveness there. One of the tricky things about when you do that is making sure you don\u2019t have spam and you\u2019re managing and giving people good quality experiences and that\u2019s where our deeper partnership, be it with PayPal and other providers so that we get the quality signals and really improve the experience as we improve comprehensiveness so both of them are going hand in hand and as we have demonstrated with Search, when we improve the organic experience the advertising experience also gives an opportunity and the system works well and so I\u2019m really excited about this change. It is still early and but it\u2019s been very positively received and you\u2019re going to see us enhance the experience in this area deeply. While we talk about shopping another area where we are investing and building the right foundation is at Google Pay and we have great leadership there as well. We\u2019ve been executing well over there for the past year and the growth on Google Pay has been strong and so being able to bring all of that together along with strong players like PayPal et cetera will help us give great experience for our users here. Ruth Porat : And in terms of your question about the financial implications of the effort, there\u2019s really not much to add here today I would just say, re \u2013 echo Sundar\u2019s comment, we\u2019re excited to have the \u2013 leading the effort, and as Sundar said at the outset, one of the priorities is creating sustainable financial value and we have a leader who has a demonstrated track record of doing that so we\u2019re excited about what he is building here with the team. Dan Salmon : Okay. Thank you both. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Great. Appreciated all the advertising updates in March, just wondering your cloud growth is obviously quite stable in the low 50\u2019s, any impact in March on workloads or a slowdown in the new customer pipeline? And then maybe Sundar, if you could talk about what could be the benefit for cloud as we get to the other side of this more work from home or just other things and secular changes in cloud that might come about from this? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Overall on cloud the interest in the momentum remains strong, we\u2019re obviously making a lot of progress both across GCP and G Suite and we find our offerings are getting deeper and we\u2019re really helping customers from a deeper standpoint so we see overall momentum. There are cases where even though the deal trajectory is the same and we have the wins. Things are taking a bit longer, naturally as you would expect. Our customers are impacted for moments like this too so I would say, time to closing some larger deals are impacted. But the companies, if anything, all the way at a CEO level, are thinking about the shift to digital in a deeper way. And I think that\u2019s a longer term trend we are excited about. Obviously, consumption gets impacted depending on the sectors which companies are in. And so that has some correlation with the general underlying performance of that sector. And so, that\u2019s something we\u2019ll have to wait and see how it develops. But the teams are doing well and it\u2019s an area where we are committed to the course we are on and investing deeply for the long run. Ruth Porat : Then you asked about kind of Q2. Nothing to highlight there, I\u2019d just reiterate what Sundar has said. We\u2019re really pleased with the Q1 performance for both GCP and G Suite. And the dynamics affecting cloud are obviously very different than those from ads. And just to build on Sundar\u2019s comments with little more on G Suite and some of our opening comments, in this work-from-home environment what we\u2019re seeing is significant interest from governments and companies looking for work-from-home solutions. So just to add one more example, Cambridge Health Alliance is a U.S. health system with a 140,000 patients. And they relied on G Suite to support their staff and caregivers during COVID-19, helping them connect across hospitals, health centers from home. And it\u2019s just yet another example of how we\u2019re able to be present, helpful, useful in this time. Justin Post : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Rippey from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Kevin Rippey : Hi, thanks for taking the question guys. One for Sundar and then one for Ruth. Sundar, the question for you really relates to the resiliency you\u2019re seeing within direct response piece of YouTube, like are there specific factors or is it a question of mix of advertisers there, that\u2019s sustaining the growth? And then the question for Ruth, you highlighted that this has given you an opportunity to refocus on cost discipline. It looks like that the capital returns by way of buyback remain quite strong in the quarter. Has this affected your thoughts on buybacks and capital returns going forward? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Maybe stepping back, I would say, we are overall seeing strong momentum on YouTube. People are turning to YouTube. Our watch-time has increased across the board. People are also looking for our authoritative news content. Viewership on YouTube has increased significantly compared to last year or two. So in many ways through the pandemic, people are using YouTube. And the trends are global across North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific as well. On direct response, I do think, I think people are \u2013 it\u2019s a journey, and people who have been investing are seeing that it is cost effective, and so, over time more people are looking at it. Our sales teams are doing an excellent job of helping our customers understand the opportunities there, and so being able to bring all of that to bear. In the case of App Campaigns, we have done it with Universal App Campaigns. So we\u2019ve just made it easier as a customer, not to think about whether you\u2019re trying to do this across Search or YouTube. And bring a simple holistic solution, so all of that is impacting. I mentioned gaming earlier. When you think about things like unboxing and product reviews, those are natural home for transactions as well. I earlier mentioned about all the work we are doing now on commerce. All of that, I am looking forward to those integrations coming into YouTube and working better as well. And so, those are some of the longer-term opportunities. We are working hard to get the experience right and building the right foundation for the future. Ruth Porat : And then on your second question on capital returns, we believe a share repurchase program for us appropriately sized is responsible on the current environment based on our capital allocation framework and our cash balance. So in the beginning of the year, I indicated that we expected to repurchase shares at a pace at least consistent with the fourth quarter on the remaining authorization and that remains our view for the second quarter. Operator : Thank you and our final question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Okay, thanks. In terms of the \u2013 maybe less worse or somewhat positive trends at the end, you mentioned this recovery or modest move up in consumer commercial search queries, have you also seen a small improvement in advertiser interest in running campaigns? I think you said both of those factors kind of deteriorated in March. One of them came back. Did the other come back too? Did you also see advertisers starting to come back? And then, secondly, the YouTube result in the March quarter was phenomenally strong given what happened in the month of March to YouTube. Is that a comp issue? Was the comp much easier? It sounds as like January, February could have been up strong 40% year-over-year. So is there any color? Is that just comps, easy comps, or was there something that fundamentally changed that cause that kind of material acceleration? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So as I tried to be really clear in my response to others\u2019 question, I would not extrapolate from my comments for the full quarter. It\u2019s early, just giving you an early read and there\u2019s really not much more to add than what I indicated, so nothing more to add there. And then, in terms of\u2026 Sundar Pichai : Yeah, maybe just to reiterate what was said earlier and I said that Search tends to \u2013 people respond to changes in Search faster, brand trail. So brand is maybe slower to change both on the downside and the upside. And Search is much faster to adapt as well. And so I think that\u2019s worth keeping in mind. But overall, look, we see a vibrant system. Advertisers are definitely very engaged and looking at it. And we are seeing active conversations between our teams and our large advertisers, where they\u2019re trying to understand the demand shifts and how they can respond. And so, overall, I see the \u2013 both from users, users are engaging with Google, YouTube and our core products and services. And while, obviously, there\u2019s an impact on the economy and we\u2019re not immune to that, the engagement from advertisers across our products and with our teams has been very robust. Operator : Thank you and that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks. Jim Friedland : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2020 call. Thank you and have a good evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Alphabet Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. . I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. James Friedland : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Jim, and thank you, everyone, for joining in. It's certainly been a busy week, and I'm glad to be here. I hope everyone is staying safe and well. All of us at Google continue to send our deepest gratitude to everyone on the front lines of the pandemic all around the world. I also want to personally thank all our employees who continue to work so hard to make sure our products and services are available for everyone right now. People looking for important health information, hard-hit businesses working to inform customers about opening hours or delivery options or teachers connecting to their students. The macroeconomic environment caused by the pandemic created headwinds for our business. Our revenue declined on a reported basis and is flat year-over-year on a fixed FX basis. Like other companies, this quarter, we saw the early signs of stabilization as users return to commercial activity online. This is true across most of our advertising verticals and geographies. Of course, the economic climate remains fragile.  One thing I'd like to call out is our continuing journey to invest in and grow new businesses. We delivered strong growth in our non-ads revenues particularly from Cloud, Google Play and YouTube subscriptions. This, in turn, is helping our partners, developers and creators earn revenue and deliver valuable services to people. We are focused on the steps to build long-term value with these opportunities.  Today, I'll review the quarter by walking through the 4 key areas for 2020 that you heard me mention over the last several quarters : creating the most helpful products for everyone; providing the most trusted experiences for our users; executing at scale; and creating sustainable value. Ruth Porat : Thanks, Sundar. We are cautiously encouraged by our results for the second quarter, although mindful of the fragile global economic environment. Our advertising revenues gradually improved through the quarter, and our non-advertising revenue lines maintained their strong performance particularly Google Cloud and Play. I will begin with a review of the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets and conclude with outlook. Sundar and I will then take your questions. Starting with consolidated Alphabet results, our total revenues in the second quarter were $38.3 billion, down 2% year-on-year and flat in constant currency. Year-on-year declines in our advertising revenues from Search and Network were offset by growth in Google Other and Google Cloud revenues. Details of Alphabet's consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release. Across each region, we saw a gradual improvement in revenues in the quarter with some differences reflecting product mix. In terms of the foreign exchange impact, exchange rate movements resulted in approximately a 2% headwind to reported revenues. Operator : . And our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS. Eric Sheridan : Maybe two, if I can, for Sundar. One, on the commerce initiatives, a lot of announcements from the company in the quarter, moving towards sort of commission-free and amplifying both the advertising and e-commerce efforts. I want to understand some of the moves you're making strategically and how you think that positions you broadly against, obviously, an e-commerce landscape that's seeing a lot of pulled forward penetration given the current environment. And second on YouTube, obviously, a fairly volatile brand advertising environment and TV advertising remains in flux. What are the opportunities both in the U.S. and globally to go after sort of TV ad budgets under the YouTube umbrella? Sundar Pichai : On Shopping, I spoke a little bit in my remarks, but really excited at the potential there. The team has been executing very well. Overall, users come to Google a lot to find the products they are looking for, but we see an opportunity to invest and make the experience better. Sometimes the journeys may fail because they don't find what they're looking for. So we want to make sure it's comprehensive.  Next when people find what they like, we want to make it simple for them to transact. And so working on that end-to-end experience has been a big focus. And obviously, making sure for merchants, really making sure we are open to business for merchants, and we are giving value to them has been the focus. The early indications are that users are responding positively, both in terms of user engagement and more importantly, giving value back to merchants for their investment there. So in some ways, it's a return to our first principles. We want to ensure that Google is the best place for merchants to connect with users. And so I'm excited by it, and you'll continue to see us focus in this area.  The second was on YouTube brand. Obviously, YouTube has been doing well in terms of engagement and watch time. And so we see a long-term opportunity there. We've had strength on direct response as well through this quarter. But on brand, which was your question, we are obviously investing not just in YouTube main product, YouTube TV as well. And so areas where we can offer a bundle, advertisers are interested in streaming, and so bringing that bundle together, especially to advertisers and upfronts through YouTube Select is a big opportunity as well. So we are focused on that. Operator : And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : I have two. Just first, Ruth, curious if you can just talk about the cost structure a little bit more. We know you'll continue to invest to drive growth over the long term. Just curious how you're thinking about it as the top line starts to recover more hopefully over coming quarters. And then secondly, I know you said that search trends were flat to last year by the end of June. Just curious if there's anything you could add in terms of what you've seen more recently over the last month as well. Ruth Porat : Thanks for this, Doug. So in terms of cost structure, as we talked about last quarter, we have been focused on taking steps to enhance efficiency in the near term. And that being said, as Sundar and I both noted, what you're seeing is the fact that we do remain focused on investing for the long term. So sort of breaking that down in cost of revenues, while TAC and content acquisition costs are obviously tied to revenues, there is a sizable percentage of other cost of revenues that are not directly correlated with revenue growth, as I noted in opening comments, and we are very focused on the user experience and the overall ecosystem. So we are investing to make sure that we're supporting our products so they remain reliable in all environments.  And then in OpEx, much of our operating expense is generally less variable and not necessarily correlating to revenues in the near term. So in terms of a couple of the items, although we do continue to expect the year-on-year headcount growth rate to decelerate, as I noted, we are hiring aggressively in priority areas like Cloud. And so we're taking near-term steps to enhance efficiency but still investing for the long term. So we're trying to make sure that we're getting those tradeoffs right. And as I noted, we do expect the year-on-year headcount growth rate in 2020 to be down somewhat from the 20% year-on-year rate last year, and that's even adjusting for 2 items that put upward pressure on headcount growth. The first, we're moving certain customer support roles from third-party vendors to Google's in-house operation center. That is actually OpEx neutral, but does increase reported spend. And then second, the pending acquisition of Fitbit. So we're trying to navigate it appropriately.  In terms of your second question, in terms of search trends and what we saw throughout the quarter, I would say that following a rough end to the first quarter, ads revenue gradually improved in the quarter, not only in Search, but YouTube and Network. And so for Search, we ended March at a midteens percentage decline in year-on-year revenues. And then as we progressed through the second quarter, we saw a gradual return in user search activity to more commercial topics, and then that was followed by an increase in spending by advertisers. So that resulted in a gradual improvement in year-on-year Search revenue trends in the second quarter. We ended basically flat to last year by the end of June and you know to carry it forward, although we're pleased that ads revenue gradually improved throughout the quarter.  As I said, we do believe it's premature to say, they were out of the woods given the fragile nature of the macro environment. And as you're aware, ad spend does tend to be correlated with macroeconomic performance. And so the macro backdrop will continue to be a key signal to monitor. But to your question, based on our estimates from the end of June through last quarter, there has been a modest improvement in July. Operator : And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : I just wanted to ask a question on -- two questions related to Google Cloud, if I could. One, Sundar, I was wondering if you could share with us how you've seen the change in pace of customers migrating workloads to the cloud given COVID? And I'm also wondering if you could share with us kind of the puts and takes, and Microsoft talked about this a little bit last week with their Azure business, but for those that have accelerated workload migration to the cloud, how much has that offset the impacted industries or companies that you might be serving where they're seeing lower utilization than what they normally do of cloud capacity? So if you can kind of talk about the puts and takes to the growth as well, that would be great. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Heather. Overall, from my vantage point, obviously with Google Cloud, we've been investing to scale up, especially on the people side, on engineering, go-to-market and then, obviously on our investment side with data centers, cloud regions and so on. And so for me, it's been good to see as we are scaling up, we are executing more effectively. I've been personally involved in many, many conversations last quarter. We had many large customers come on to cloud, big telco deals and banking deals, Deutsche Bank, as an example. So overall, I felt the momentum was strong. Generally, felt like things were continuing well through the course. Felt like more a secular interest in our digital transformation companies are deeply thinking long term and planning for us. So overall, I felt at the moment, almost there. And I felt our execution as we are scaling up. Obviously, we are scaling up a lot. And so it's -- the combination is working well.  Your second question in terms of puts and takes. Overall, I think there are -- I won't -- I don't know whether there's anything significant worth for me highlighting. Obviously, you are right to point out that it doesn't affect everyone the same, but nothing significant for me to highlight here today. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have two. The first one, Sundar, we try to always figure out changes in consumer behavior. I guess as you have sort of been studying what people have been doing through shelter-in-place and from the way things are changing from a consumer perspective, talk to us about areas you're most focused on, investing in and driving your teams to create new products to really help consumers with their changing habits. And then the second one, Ruth, I know as we sort of we look ahead with potentially a larger percentage of the workforce, work remote or work from home, without looking for quantification, maybe just talk to us about some puts and takes to areas where you could see either efficiency or higher potential costs from a larger percentage of the workforce being remote over the long term. Sundar Pichai : Yes. On the first one, when there is -- the shift to online is profound. We see people engaging a lot, doing newer things than they did before. People's interests have -- are broadening, I would say, across the board. And so for example, we are -- for me, I'm looking at different types of user journeys and making sure each of them is getting deeper and better. So for example, in Google, as people have started coming for more health-related information, how is that experience working, thinking about that for the long-term and investing in it. I obviously spoke about Shopping earlier, and that's been a big focus for us. Education in general. And when we think through small, medium businesses and bigger companies thinking through collaboration, where G Suites' potential is, the investments we are undertaking, all that is very exciting to me.  But I would say cutting underneath all that, maybe while we didn't talk about it, really focused on our AI teams doing the investments they need, evolving our next-generation TPUs and the team's building better models and better algorithms. All that, I think, our ability to do more things is something I'm really interested in and focused on as well. So that's something I'm excited about -- for the longer term. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of your question about work-from-home, I think it's a great point because it obviously feeds so much into a lot of the product work that we're doing in Cloud through G Suite, et cetera. So that's where I would actually start, but I appreciate what you're asking is how are we looking at our own cost base. And we called that out last quarter, in particular, with respect to CapEx, and you can sort of see it here this quarter. The main change in CapEx has really been we slowed the pace on the office facilities front. And what we're looking at is really how to reimagine what the workplace will look like. We continue to be very much focused on the fact that place and space are important. We believe in collaboration. Serendipity is key to innovation. So we do view space in office as important and are very focused on what does that mean over the long term. We've actually opened quite a number of our offices, in fact, in 40 countries and do hope to reopen in many more. But your question to what does it mean for overall cost structure, we're looking at that with the place you see it now is in our CapEx, and the way we've been looking at it and our indication that we do expect 2020 will be lower CapEx on the facility side as a result. Operator : And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent Thill : I was just curious if you could just comment in terms of some of the near-term business trends and anything that's changed as you've gone through the month of July versus what you saw in June? Ruth Porat : Sure. I already commented on that with respect to Search, but to broaden it a bit more, and again, this is based on estimates from the end of June through last week. So for YouTube, we ended March with a year-on-year growth rate in the high single digits, and that's reflecting a substantial headwind from brand. The headwind from brand moderated modestly at the end of the second quarter, and then we saw a further improvement in July. Direct response has been consistently strong.  For Network, revenues improved toward the end of the second quarter, and we have seen a further slight improvement in July. Obviously, 3 weeks is not a quarter, but that's based on the estimates here from the end of June. And then as Sundar and I both said, when you look at, for example, Cloud, it has maintained its strength consistently. And I'd say that with a business that's growing at this pace, it's really much more about a secular trend to the move to cloud. So really nothing to comment on there. Operator : And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America. Justin Post : Great. Sundar, I don't know how much you can comment on the regulatory environment, but it's obviously top of mind with the hearing yesterday. Maybe just characterize it for Google right now. And are you seeing any progress with the regulatory environment? And then secondly, we saw the YouTube TV price increase, a pretty interesting business model. But longer term, do you see that as really strategically important for the YouTube brand? Or do you think you can have a really profitable business on that? Sundar Pichai : On the regulatory front, we've obviously been operating under scrutiny for a while, and we realize, at our scale, that's appropriate. And we've engaged constructively across jurisdictions. And from my standpoint, I'm confident in the approach we take, our focus on users and in the evidence in almost all areas we operate in. We expand choice or overall lower prices. And it's -- overall, there's a very fast pace of innovation. So it's dynamic and competitive.  Having said that, obviously, we will operate based on the rules. And so to the extent there are any areas where we need to adapt, we will. And as a company, I think we will be, I think, being flexible around those things is important, I think. I think the scrutiny is going to be here for a while, and so we are committed to working through it. On the second question around YouTube TV, yes, there is -- I mean, it's a good question. I spoke earlier about even from a brand and how people think about it, they are interested in streaming. So as YouTube TV gets more scale, I think we will see more opportunities there. We are obviously still in the early stages of building out the product. And just recently, we've added a bunch of new channels and making sure it's working well.  In the U.S., the TV market is a big part of the advertising market, too. So overall, if we can invest here and scale up, I think the synergies with YouTube will become more meaningful over time. And so excited the traction the product is getting. But still too early. Operator : And our next question comes from Kevin Rippey from Evercore. Kevin Rippey : This one is for Sundar. I was hoping you might be able to expand on the earlier comment you made about the AI strategy. I'm particularly wondering, if there's been things over the past 5 months since the pandemic began, that you thought an expansion of a very high strategy or an evolution of the past strategy might be able to solve for whether that relates to commercialization or monetization or really anything across the business. Just really, really curious. Sundar Pichai : An area which -- first of all, across the board, the progress is steep. So I'm very happy with the pace at which our R&D on AI is progressing. And for me, it's important that we are state-of-the-art as a company, and we are leading. And to me, I'm excited at the pace at which our engineering and R&D teams are working both across Google and DeepMind. So I'm excited about it. Specifically, we are making good progress in areas like language understanding. And you saw some improvements last year, significant improvements with BERT and Search. But BERT took us a few years to get there. But things like that, I see more stuff in the future. And so excited by it.  An area where I think we are still under-tapped vis-\u00e0-vis potential is definitely Cloud. We see the potential there. But -- and I think it's a bit related to Heather's question, too. I think companies are thinking about migrating workloads and so on. But the longer run opportunity of actually using AI to truly have business solutions for you for whatever industry you are in, that feels like there's a lot of potential, and we are still very early there. And so part of it is, for us, connecting the dots internally and bringing it as solutions to our users. We have done it in certain product areas, but I see there's a bigger opportunity in the future. Operator : And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays. Ross Sandler : Great. I just had two questions. First, on YouTube subscription. So can you talk about the size of that area of the business relative to that $15 billion? We had it at about 15% of total YouTube revenue. And then how is the faster growth in that area relative to advertising impacting your long-term profitability goals at YouTube? And then the second question is on Search. So it sounds like the flat exit run rate year-on-year is pretty encouraging. If we strip out travel, I'm guessing it's well above that. So how would you characterize the query growth versus just the ad auction dynamics outside of travel across the other categories? Are we back to pre-COVID levels in those areas? Ruth Porat : So in terms of the first question, we haven't broken out the specifics within the YouTube subscription revenues. YouTube subscriptions are in Other revenues, it's not in advertising revenues. And overall, as we think about the opportunity -- our view is -- and we talked about this when we were launching the subscription product, it was really responsive to what we were hearing from users. And as we look at it, music is a key part of the overall YouTube experience. It's an important component of watch time. And what we found is that users wanted -- they wanted choice and some wanted a premium YouTube experience with ad-free viewing and the ability to download songs and videos. And that was really the impetus.  In addition, YouTube Premium provides additional revenue streams for music labels and publishers. So for example, in 2019, YouTube paid the music industry over $3 billion. And what we've done is meaningfully ramp our geographic presence from 5 countries in the beginning of 2018 to 94 countries today. And earlier this year, we announced that YouTube Premium had more than 20 million paid subscribers, up more than 60% versus the prior year. So our subscriber numbers have continued to grow there, and it really was driven by the goal to give users choice. Operator : And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Colin Sebastian : I guess maybe a follow-up to the earlier question on commerce. Beyond the marketplace functionality and some of the free year promotional transactions, I wonder how some of the other initiatives are going to play a role. And things I'm thinking specifically are, were you focused before on Google Checkout and Maps and some of the assistant functionality, how those may play a changing role in commerce on the Google platform. Sundar Pichai : Yes. Great question. I think the bar is to have that super simple experience, which is delightful and that you have peace of mind and satisfaction in terms of getting the product and being able to return it and so on. So the end-to-end funnel matters a lot. And part of the reason why through the changes, a couple of things we have done. As you saw, we changed and we removed the commission for merchants to be on the platform. And part of it is by removing that. They can take that and invest in, be it shipping, be it delivery, be it the customer experience. And so that matters, matters I think in the overall experience.  And from our standpoint, the Buy on Google experience is something which deeply investing in. Obviously, our integrations with PayPal, our investments are underlying it to make sure for a lot of users that it's as close to a one-click experience as possible is a big part of the investment as well. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC. Mark Mahaney : I want to ask a broad question about Google. Google's place or position, whatever, in online retail. And I asked this because Google has also -- obviously been central. Search has been central, but also YouTube has been central to commerce, online commerce for the last 20 years. We've gone through this pandemic where there's a real inflection point. We see it in Amazon's results. We see it in Shopify's results. And I'm not sure I see it in Google's results. So just talk about how you think, broadly, Google is positioned for what's really been like a 2 or 3 year pull-forward in accelerated ramp up of online retail demand. And are you positioned the way you want to be positioned now? Are there things you need to make to the -- changes you needed to make the products and services to be better positioned? Sundar Pichai : Obviously, I think as a company, our strength comes from the diverse categories in which we serve users, right? And it's not just product, it's services, it's wide areas, including areas like travel. So it's diversified. And -- but it also means through a pandemic, there are areas of strength, but there are areas of -- areas where you get impacted as well. So I think that's what is reflected in what you see. On e-commerce, you're right, direct e-commerce providers are seeing a big inflection point. But in it are essential categories like groceries and stuff, which are built in, which we don't directly play in. But to us, the reason we are doing this long-term focused effort on shopping with the new leadership team is to precisely make sure as a platform, we are improving and as the shift continues, Google continues to be an important place by which people come and participate in those journeys.  So long run, I see a growth opportunity with related to what we are investing in there as well. Not just through Search, but a Search in the Shopping investments we are making, but in YouTube, and also helping retailers on the cloud side. It's an area where there's naturally a lot of interest to work -- to partner with Google, and so we see that as a big opportunity as well. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks. James Friedland : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We know you all have a busy evening. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2020 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Alphabet Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. . I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. James Friedland : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai and Ruth Porat. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking. And such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC and in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 expected to be filed with the SEC later today. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. This quarter, our performance was consistent with the broader online environment. It's also testament to the investment we've made to improve search and deliver a highly relevant experience that people turn to for help in moments big and small. We saw an improvement in advertiser spend across all geographies, and most of verticals, with the world accelerating its transition to online and digital services. In Q3, we also saw strength in Google Cloud, Play and YouTube subscriptions. This is the third quarter we are reporting earnings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Access to information has never been more important. This year, including this quarter showed how valuable Google's founding Product Search has been to people. And importantly, our products and investments are making a real difference as businesses work  and get back on their feet. Whether it's finding the latest information on COVID-19 cases in their area, which local businesses are open, or what online courses will help them prepare for new jobs, people continue to turn to Google search. You can now find useful information about offerings like no contact delivery or curbside pickup for 2 million businesses on search and maps. And we have used Google's Duplex AI Technology to make calls to businesses and confirm things like temporary closures. This has enabled us to make 3 million updates to business information globally. We know that people's expectations for instant perfect search results are high. That's why we continue to invest deeply in AI and other technologies to ensure the most helpful search experience possible. Two weeks ago, we announced a number of search improvements, including our biggest advancement in our spelling systems in over a decade. A new approach to identifying key moments and videos, and one of people's favorites hum to search which will identify a song noticed based on the humming. We also announced that bird a huge breakthrough in natural language understanding that we introduced last year. Now we improve results for almost every English search query. We are also investing in improving the shopping experience in search to help people find the best products and prices available from a wide range of merchants. We recently added easy to see price comparisons to help consumers know if they're getting a good deal. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Sundar. We are very pleased by our results in the third quarter, which reflect both broad based increases in advertiser spending in search and YouTube, as well as ongoing strength in our non-advertising revenue lines, in particular Google Cloud and Play. Starting with consolidated Alphabet results, our total revenues in the quarter were $46.2 billion, up 14% year-on-year and up 15% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenues was $21.1 billion up 20% year-on-year, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $13 billion and up 29% year-over-year. The biggest factors here again this quarter were costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, and then content acquisition costs primarily driven by costs for YouTube's advertising supported content, followed by cost per subscription service content. Operating expenses were $13.8 billion up 1% year-on-year, reflecting both the impact of actions taken earlier in the year as a result of COVID as well as lapping a $554 million legal settlement in the third quarter of 2019. In terms of the three component parts of , first, the deceleration in R&D growth was due primarily to slower headcount. Second, the year-on-year decline in sales and marketing expenses, reflects the planned reduction in advertising and promotional spend that we implemented towards the end of the first quarter. Third, G&A growth reflects the lapping of the settlement. All three categories benefited from lower G&A expenses due to COVID. Operator : Thank you. . And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan : Question maybe I could ask to Sundar on the high level. You called out some of the innovation you're aiming for over the medium to long-term with respect to search, can you take a step back and maybe give us your sense of how search is going to evolve from a product it is today where there's a lot of input by the user to sort of the push dynamic with the Discover feed and Discover ads that could drive both engagement and monetization across your platform? And the second part of the question was, it seems like you're taking a little bit of a different tactic with your hardware strategy this year, they're a little bit less of it. And it was more on the mid to low render the price range of hardware, how does hardware and broadly time the assistant into the hardware strategy fit broadly similar into your view for where search is going to the medium to long-term? Thanks so much. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Eric. Good questions. On search, you're right, today, particularly with mobile and ambient computing, that is, you having access to computing across other form factors. I think information both you go looking for it and there are times, it's important that you have relevant information at your fingertips. So I do think about it as a holistic user journey. And obviously, in search will continue to evolve Discover has been very good in terms of Discover and YouTube both play a role in making sure people are getting relevant information. And, I think for us, it's important holistically, we're meeting users information needs and out of which, the monetization opportunity also works as well. So long -- this is why, be it, Discover or be it how we pick up on YouTube, all of that matters for us. On your second question on our hardware, I'm excited about the, we are doing some deeper investments in hardware, which, which are some of it take students for years to come together. And so, excited at the terrific roadmap ahead. I think we have definitely shown that Pixel 4a Pixel 5, clear value proposition, and we'll build on that. You know our portfolio, you know, we are thoughtfully thinking about what are the important form factors, which matters and we do think about it with the view of fair search and assistant will be important as well. So in many ways, hardware is there to strategically benefit both how we guide the Android ecosystem. How do we make sure information is right there at user's fingertips. And so those are both strategic views we take into it as well, but I'm excited about the roadmap ahead and next year you would see as lean more into some of our deeper investments will come into play there. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the question. Ruth, we appreciate the incremental color on 3Q and 4Q expenses, which was hoping that you could help us understand the cost structure a little bit more, kind of as we're coming out of this and just know whether you're anticipating any more notable changes, just coming out of the pandemic kind of around the sustainability of the margin improvements that you saw in this quarter. Thanks. Ruth Porat : Thanks for that, Doug. So as I said, as a result of COVID, we did make tactical adjustments to slow the pace of spent in certain categories. And that, that started late in the first quarter. And in part, that's what you see here, plus the impact from the improvements in revenue performance. And we do remain focused on optimizing efficiency where we can, we've said that on many prior calls, but as we've also discussed with you on prior calls, as both Sundar and I noted, today, we are committed to making the right investments to support long-term profitable growth. And I think what's exciting in this environment, there appears to be an acceleration in digital transformation that underscores the importance of the products and services that we provide, and the longer term opportunities. So we will continue to invest to best position us for the long-term opportunity. An obvious example is cloud, we do intend to maintain a high level of investment, given the opportunity we see that includes the ongoing increases in our go-to-market organization, our engineering organization, as well as the investments to support the necessary CapEx. So hopefully that gives you a bit more color there. Doug Anmuth : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini : Great, thank you very much for taking the question. Sundar, I have a question for you. Just Thomas has been the Head of Google Cloud now for around two years, if I remember correctly, I'm just wondering, what do you see as the biggest changes he's put into place that has allowed the business to start gaining what appears to be materially more share? And as you look ahead to 2021, and what's going on with digital transformation, what would you say is top strategic priorities would be? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Heather. A couple things stand out for me, I think it's been a very consistent focus strategy. So the focus on the five major geographies, the four customer segments in the six priority industries, healthcare, retail, financial services, media, entertainment, manufacturing and public sector, that focus and going deeper, and scaling our go-to-market, both in terms of our people, our partner, partners setting, that's been key. The second thing I would say is some of the key differentiators are playing out particularly as we have taken them deeper as unique industry solutions. So going deeper and having solutions and in some of those cases where we are now pricing based on value. I think that kind of deeper play, something I'm very excited about, definitely have strengthen just based on our underlying technology. So we do have differentiation in areas like data analytics, AI, et cetera. So that's been, that's been huge as well. But I'm pleased with the execution obviously, in this there is a time lag between when you hire the sales and when we train and when you enable them to be more productive. And that's the investment Ruth has been talking about. And I can see it ramping, and they can see the results come into play. So credit towards that focus and execution and so looking forward to the next . Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you very much. Sundar Pichai : Thanks for converging. And Best wishes. Heather Bellini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my question. Sundar, I wanted to ask one about ecommerce specifically, you know, it seems to become increasingly competitive within the ecommerce funnel. So maybe talk to us about one, what types of consumer behavior changes? Are you seeing within ecommerce search on the platform? And then, in your mind, what are the key priorities of investment, you need to really execute on to ensure you stay at the top of the funnel within ecommerce? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : I think thanks that standard, first of all, I'm excited that, the set of announcements and progress we've had in the last few months. And obviously, we're really focused on the user experience, and we want to make sure, as a consumer you vide, comprehensive, high quality, inventory and offerings and experience on the platform, our free shopping listings, which we launched in the U.S. is now available in 48 countries around the world. Additionally, we eliminated commission fees. So for the buy on Google Checkout option, opened the platform up to, you know, PayPal Shopify for integration as well. So that gives rise to comprehensiveness. And we are focused on quality there. In terms of the funnel and behavior, to me, what's interesting is, obviously, search captures the intent of the moment and the breadth of search, I think has been, has been a real asset. And, you know, both you -- as users adapt, advertisers adapt to so you can see that see the dynamic play in real time. But you do see, I would say YouTube is an important platform for ecommerce as well. I can see advertisers in the YouTube of the mid funnel level, even currently, if that's not the intent at that moment, investor, create demand, create interest, and so on. So, for us EC commerce working across the platform, and I think that's an opportunity and then making sure the rest of the experience is good for users is something we are deeply focused on. Brian Nowak : Thanks Sundar. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. Ruth, you called brand advertisers coming back to YouTube, I'm just curious if you could give us a sense of where you're seeing that strength in kind of where you at relative to pre covered levels, with, with those advertisers? Ruth Porat : So overall, we're pleased at the degree to which advertisers really have reactivated their budgets, this in the third quarter, they reacting in part two, I think, evidence that consumers are showing strong demand across nearly all verticals, it's everything from home and garden to computer to work from home. And so very helpful there. And then YouTube's strong watch time growth enables advertisers to reach audience that they can't reach on TV, as we've often talked about. And so they're increasingly looking to ask to help them reach people who are going to YouTube to learn new topics and engage with fresh entertaining content, great, great, unique content. So it's, it's been an opportunity, we're pleased to senior performance in the third quarter. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Justin post from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Great, thank you so much, maybe one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, thanks for the update on the DOJ. As you think about all the regulators all over the world, is there. Is there any hope of coming to a middle ground here? How are you thinking about how far apart you guys are in different regions? And then maybe for Ruth, on the YouTube opportunity, if you assume about 2 billion users, you're on a run rate of maybe $10 per user. I just wondering how you how you're thinking about the monetization? Are you still very early and if you can give us any help on what the margins might look like? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Ruth, you want to go ahead -- Ruth Porat : So look, in terms of YouTube, as I said, we are pleased with the ongoing momentum that you see in the revenue line, I think, as we've talked to you about quite frequently, in our ad supported business within YouTube, we do pay out a majority of revenues to all of our content creators, we pay all of the infrastructure and networking costs that's you know, for storing for serving video or otherwise for running YouTube. And that includes marketing, supporting content creators, there's quite a bit more that we think is invaluable for creators in the overall ecosystem to make sure we're creating not only great experiences for users and creators, but really the right overall ecosystem. And we've talked about that in the context of how we invest, protect, content -- protect the content, that people are seeing content, moderation investments we view as really an invaluable part of what we're doing and critically important. So we're continuing to support that do view, the experience that both creators and users have is just really differentiated as a result. And then on the subscription side, we're continuing to build it out, as Sundar noted in his opening comments, both YouTube Music premium and YouTube TV, do you have higher content acquisition costs as a percentage of revenues than YouTube ads, and we are early there continuing to build out that subscriber base. Sundar Pichai : And Justin, on the regulatory front, scrutiny is not new for us. And in some ways, it's now sector wide, and not surprisingly, so. We will engage constructively where possible. And as we have shown through some of the past cases, when there is -- we'll be confident about the benefits we bring to our users, we'll make our case where there is feedback or rulings, we'll be flexible and adapt and so we are building that into it. I think while there's a lot on the legislative and regulatory front, as some of this gets resolved, it also creates certainty, and in some cases, clarity and opportunities as well. And so, and so that's the framework with which we approach it. And we'll take a long-term view towards it. And but -- at the end of the day, what's in our control is our ability to relentlessly focus on users and build great products. And that's where most of our energy will go into. Justin Post : Yes, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks two questions, please. It sounds like you're going to provide more disclosure on Google Cloud in the fourth quarter, will that also be on the profitability of Google Cloud or could you address the question of whether Google Cloud has reached a point of scale where it's no longer dilutive to overall margins, and then briefly, two new revenue opportunities, or growing revenue opportunities over the year Google Maps and the Discover tab, any update or any new data points that suggest a monetization opportunity with those two assets? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So thanks for that Mark. And when we break out Cloud, and we will be also reporting that is the fourth quarter results, but we'll be providing full year results for 2018 \u201819 and \u201820. We'll be providing not just the revenue disaggregation data that we expanded earlier this year, but we will be adding operating income for each of our segments, which we think is the most relevant data. And the point, that both Sundar and I have underscored is that we are investing aggressively in cloud given the opportunity that we see. And frankly, the fact that we were later relative to peers were encouraged -- very encouraged by the pace of customer wins, and the very strong revenue growth in both GCP and workspace. But we do intend to maintain a high level of investment to best position ourselves. And I kind of went through some of those items that the go-to-market team, the engineering team and CapEx. And so we describe this as a multiyear path, because we do believe we're still early in this journey. Sundar Pichai : On a Maps and Discover, et cetera, again, I think I spoke a little bit earlier about thinking through more holistically an example where we -- I think worked well as you know, as developers, we're looking to promote apps that are universal app campaigns, you could really reach across and it's a good model to think about recently, for example, to serve small and medium businesses, we expanded smart campaigns to 150 countries and they're a small business owner, you can set up your first campaign, create your first ad in 15 minutes from the from your mobile device. So for me thinking about these surfaces, as you know, we'll do the hard work to make sure the most relevant information gets and thinking about it more holistically. And I think gives us a chance to also engage users in the way they want us to, sometimes when they come looking for it, and sometimes when they proactively want information given to them. And so that's the overall view and I think the opportunity is very exciting ahead. Mark Mahaney : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets Your line is now open. Daniel Salmon : Great. Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, in your response to the DOJs lawsuit  compared to your search partnerships to how  brand might pay a supermarket to be at the end of the row or at high level. We've also heard Philip Schindler talk about your addressable market being potentially twice as large as commonly viewed and maybe that includes things like those payments inside supermarkets. So my question is two parts. Firstly, is it fair to tie those two types of comments together and assume that they're related to each other? And then second, could you maybe talk about how that might matter to your bigger picture thinking about the advertising and ecommerce opportunity for Google? And in particular, the competitive environment you face? Sundar Pichai : Yes, Dan at a high level stepping back from it all? We are -- our mission is to provide information, so the competitive environment we faces, particularly with mobile and user looking for information, there's \u2013 so many choices they have. And so the question is, you know, making should Google is a relevant way by which they get that information. And, you know, you can imagine when people are looking to buy products, or the competitors that exist, travel, booking hotels or any category you take and so for us that's why I talk about holistically competing and making sure we can provide relevant information is both competition we face for mindshare, and that's the opportunity we have ahead. In terms of specifics of the DOJ case and stuff and confident, you know, we have approached everything, both with the view of making sure we create the best user experience and be -- we really want, we've always built Google for everyone. So we want it to be available on all platforms and be convenient for users to access our services and as part of that partner with other companies in doing so. And so look forward to making our case there. But it's definitely early days. And we're still reviewing an understanding it all. And I'm sure we'll update more as time goes by. Daniel Salmon : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is now open. Colin Sebastian : Thanks, I have a couple here as well. Maybe just a follow up on the shopping question. Specifically on YouTube, if you could expand on the role that shopping and shopping ads are now playing in the growth strategy there. And on Google workspace, it seemed like this is an unique opportunity, with work from home to really drive adoption and monetization of the services, including meet as well as bundling with cloud services, so I wonder if you could provide little more detail on the levels of usage and engagement you're seeing with those applications? And how you plan to monetize those going forward. Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Great, on shopping and YouTube, definitely say, we are on the earlier part of the journey. But we have seen the strength in YouTube for direct response and on a few other categories. And I think the experiences we see there, I think can directly carryover to commerce. And as we build out the experience, so I see that as an opportunity. I earlier also mentioned about what searches currently capturing the intent at that given time, YouTube, advertisers can take a longer term view create brand awareness, create interest, and so on. So that also offers, opportunity. So we today in many, many categories have creators with very compelling content. And I've always felt things work well if you match user interest and it's very relevant to users. And so I think commerce, there is a lot of commercial activity on YouTube organically. And so I see it as a long-term opportunity. On Google workspace, I'm very excited that, we both have strong growth, I mentioned meet metrics earlier, that we saw a peak of 235 million daily meeting participants in Q3 and more than 7.5 billion daily video call minutes. Definitely significant growth and meet as well as our other products like docs drive and chat. But Google workspace also now creates the unified experience and I think we are definitely seeing a lot of interest. And demand there, I do think COVID is really accelerating the future of work. And many of the trends there are, you know, will last through time, and I think gives all of us a chance to reimagine this, what would we imagined? What does collaboration and productivity at scale including people working remotely looks like. And we plan to be at the forefront of that, and some excited for the opportunity there. Colin Sebastian : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is now open. Ross Sandler : Hi, just two questions. If we look at search, your growth rates in January and February compared to today, so pre-COVID versus today, I guess how many categories are above the  have growth rate? Is travel the only large category at this stage that's running below your pre-COVID growth rates in search? And then the second question is on the topic of the Apple search agreement, so as you guys said in your blog post, based on other agreements, where you seeing things change hands, you didn't really lose a lot of query volume after the change. So what do you think the recapture rate of queries on the so for the toolbar would be if that deal were to change hands? Is this really a COVID situation or is it something that we should be able to manage through? Thanks a lot. Ruth Porat : So in terms of your first question, as we've often said, we have a very diverse business globally, and that's across sectors, customer size, geographies. And with respect to sectors, we saw broad based improvement across virtually all basically  what you see in the broader economy, and we don't break out more than that, but it was, quite broad based. In terms of your, second question, Sundar, do you want to take that? Sundar Pichai : On search, as I said, you know, for a long time, we work hard to make sure users can conveniently access us. Most of our partners choose us, because they are the best search provider users find us having the highest search quality. And so there's organic demand for it. And we believe in investing in our experience across all our platforms. And so we are definitely committed to making sure we can serve our users everywhere and we are really focused on it. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks. James Friedland : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We know you all have a busy evening. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter 2020 call. Thank you and have a good evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. James Friedland : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking. And such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Additional information will also be set forth in our upcoming Form 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2020. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. 2020 was a year unlike any other. We are proud that people continue to choose Google's products to stay informed, connected and comforted during uncertain times. Being helpful to people in moments big and small is the foundation of everything we do. The past year also accelerated the shift to cloud and adoption of online services. This has profound implications for all companies and consumers, and we are pleased that so many trust us to help them make this transition. In particular, Google's products and support have been a lifeline for millions of small and medium businesses hit hard by the pandemic. Today, I'll review some of the important work we have done this quarter across Google and Alphabet with a particular focus on our growing cloud business, which we are breaking out as a separate segment for the first time. Then I'll welcome to the call Google's Chief Business Officer, Philipp Schindler, who many of you know from investor conferences and events. Philipp will speak about partnerships, business and advertising trends in the Google Services segment. We have heard that you\u2019d appreciate more texture and detail there. Then Ruth will go through the quarter in more detail. First, some highlights at Google. Since the pandemic began, our teams have built new features and products to help people and businesses. Now we are helping with the complex challenge of getting vaccines to billions of people around the world. Vaccination locations have started to roll out in Google Search and Maps. Google Cloud's Intelligent Vaccine Impact platform is helping authorities improve vaccine distribution and forecasting. We are providing substantial new ad grants to the CDC, the World Health Organization and others to promote vaccine education. We're also making direct grants to organizations addressing racial and geographic disparities in vaccination access, plus opening up Google's facilities as vaccination clinics as needed. Elsewhere, in Maps, we added a new community feed in the Explore tab, and now you can track takeout and delivery orders when you book or order from Google Maps. At YouTube, we are building products to help creators benefit from 2 important trends : live video and short-form video. More than 0.5 million channels livestreamed on YouTube for the first time in 2020, from artists performing in their living rooms to churches moving their services online. And videos in our new Shorts player are receiving 3.5 billion daily views. We are looking forward to expanding Shorts to more countries this year. Philipp Schindler : Thanks, Sundar, and good afternoon, everyone. It's great to be joining you today. We're pleased with Google Services revenue of $52.9 billion in the fourth quarter, which continued the significant rebound from the negative impact of COVID earlier in the year. Two trends drove the strong results across Search, YouTube and network advertising. Consumers continued to move more of their activity online, and advertisers responded to the shift in consumer behavior by reactivating spend that they had paused earlier in the crisis. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our exceptional fourth quarter performance after an unprecedented year. For 2020, total Alphabet revenues were $183 billion, up 13% year-on-year or up 14% in constant currency. With our new segment disclosures this quarter, I'll start with quarterly results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. My focus will be on year-on-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. For the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenues were $56.9 billion, up 23%, which reflect broad-based increases in advertiser spending in Search and YouTube within Google Services as well as ongoing strength in Google Cloud. Our total cost of revenues was $26.1 billion, up 24%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $15.6 billion and up 25%. The biggest factors here were : first, content acquisition costs, primarily driven by costs for YouTube's advertising-supported content, followed by costs for subscription content; and second, costs associated with data centers and other operations, including depreciation. Operating expenses were $15.2 billion, down 4%. The year-on-year decline reflects the lapping of valuation-based compensation charges in certain Other Bets in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily in R&D, as well as the impact of actions taken earlier in the year as a result of COVID. Each of the 3 components of OpEx also reflects our decision to slow head count growth beginning late in the first quarter. Head count was up 3,180 from the third quarter. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers with continued aggressive investment in cloud for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $15.7 billion, up 69%, and our operating margin in the quarter was 28%. Other income and expense was $3 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was $15.2 billion. Operating cash flow was $22.7 billion, with free cash flow of $17.2 billion in the quarter and $43 billion for the full year 2020. We ended the fourth quarter with $137 billion in cash and marketable securities. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $52.9 billion, up 22%. Each component of our advertising revenues reflects the return of advertiser spend in response to the continued movement of consumer activity online that Philipp spoke about, including Google Search and other advertising revenues of $31.9 billion in the quarter, up 17%; YouTube advertising revenues of $6.9 billion, up 46%, driven by a rebound not only in brand advertising but also ongoing strength in direct response; network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion, up 23%. Other revenues were $6.7 billion, up 27%, primarily driven by growth in YouTube nonadvertising and Play revenues. Within Play, app revenues in the fourth quarter continued to benefit from elevated levels of engagement, reflecting increases in active buyers and spend per buyer due to COVID. However, we did experience a deceleration in growth from the levels we saw in the third quarter. Google Services operating income was $19.1 billion, up 41%, and the operating margin was 36%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, including GCP and Google Workspace. Revenues were $3.8 billion for the fourth quarter, up 47%. GCP's revenue growth rate was again meaningfully above Cloud overall. Strong growth in Google Workspace revenues was driven by growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $1.2 billion, essentially flat versus last year. As to our Other Bets, for the full year 2020, revenues were $657 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily, and reflect that most of our Other Bets are pre-revenue. The operating loss was $4.5 billion for the full year 2020 versus an operating loss of $4.8 billion in 2019. Let me end with our outlook for each segment and our investments more broadly. For Google Services, we're encouraged by the increase in consumer online activity and the return of advertiser spend as reflected in our Q4 results. Looking forward to 2021, year-over-year quarterly comparisons will be affected meaningfully by the impact of COVID last year with easier comps in the first half, especially in Q2, and then lapping stronger performance in the second half. With respect to other revenues, with the closing of the Fitbit acquisition earlier this month, we will be reporting its revenues within Google Other. In terms of investment levels within Google Services, late in the first quarter of 2020, as a result of COVID, we made what we described as tactical adjustments to slow the pace of spend in certain categories. Given the ongoing uncertainty in the external environment, we maintained the discipline through the rest of 2020. Looking forward, we do expect the pace of investment to increase to support the extraordinary opportunities we see given the usefulness of our products and services in this environment. The investment pace will ramp up over the course of the year. As for Google Cloud, we've obviously been investing aggressively given the substantial market opportunity we see. Under Thomas Kurian's leadership, we further accelerated investment to strengthen the position of the business. For example, we are on track to meet our near-term goal of tripling the size of the Cloud Direct sales force and have greatly expanded the partner channel. We've also substantially improved our product offering while rationalizing our approach to focus on our 6 key industry verticals. And we've invested in expanding our network of locations for compute capacity to support Cloud, ending 2020 serving customers in 24 regions and 73 zones. We're encouraged by the momentum in the growth of revenue and customer wins. We more than doubled revenues over the last 2 years from $5.8 billion in 2018 to $13.1 billion in 2020. Our backlog, which is nearly all attributable to Cloud, nearly tripled from 2019 to 2020. Although increases in backlog do not directly correlate to revenue trends, the growth in backlog demonstrates the success Google Cloud is having with large enterprises, which are signing meaningful long-term commitment agreements. Looking forward, we will continue to focus on revenue growth driven by ongoing investment in products and the go-to-market organization. Cloud's operating loss reflects that we have meaningfully built out our organization ahead of revenues, as we've discussed in prior quarters, with respect to the substantial investments in our go-to-market organization as well as engineering and technical infrastructure. Operating loss and operating margin will benefit from increased scale over time. In addition, we are focused on delivering on efficiency efforts across the board to contribute incrementally to profitability over time. Finally, as you can see from the historical data provided in the press release, Cloud's operating loss was higher in the first quarter relative to other quarters, and then the operating loss improves thereafter. We expect similar seasonality in 2021. In terms of Other Bets, we continue to invest with a focus on the long-term value creation opportunity. On head count, we plan to reaccelerate the pace of hiring in Google Services, in line with our opportunities. Our head count growth will also reflect the addition of Fitbit and our ongoing transition of certain customer support roles from third-party vendors to Google's in-house operation centers. We also plan to continue to prioritize investment in both sales and technical roles for Google Cloud. Turning to CapEx. At the consolidated level, the year-on-year results this quarter again reflect the slower pace throughout 2020 of investment in office facilities. Within technical infrastructure, servers continue to be the largest driver of investment in the fourth quarter, followed by data centers. Looking ahead, we expect a return to a more normalized pace of ground-up construction and fit-out of office facilities, which translates into a sizable increase in CapEx in 2021. Servers will continue to be the largest driver of spend on technical infrastructure. Finally, a housekeeping point. As noted in our earnings press release, we have adjusted the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment starting in 2021. We expect these changes will favorably impact our 2021 operating results by approximately $2.1 billion for assets as of year-end 2020. We look forward to the year ahead. I hope everyone stays safe. Thank you. And now Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions. Operator : . And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Eric Sheridan : I hope everyone is safe and well on the team out there as well. Maybe I'll try first on Cloud. I don't know if it's better to Sundar or to Ruth, but can you just conceptually help us understand how to think about the opportunity  versus Cloud and how it factors back into which you want to invest against the opportunity or, possibly, maybe even accelerate the opportunity by looking at inorganic paths to growing scale vis-\u00e0-vis competition in the space? And then maybe for Philipp if I can. YouTube continues to evolve as a platform. There's now subscription offerings. You highlighted the strength you're seeing in DR. Could you talk a little bit about the path for monetization in the coming years and how we should think about the opportunity against a large-scale audience and engagement you see at YouTube broadly? Sundar Pichai : On Cloud, obviously, we see how early customers are in the shift. We see the large TAM ahead and, definitely, the market dynamics. And our momentum, in the context of the market, is what is the framework which we are thinking about, the scale of investments and the pace of investments. Obviously, it's an area in which the longer you are in, the cohorts add up and so contributes more and the economies of scale starts working as well. But we are definitely investing ahead to making sure we are able to serve the customers globally across all the offerings they are interested in, and that's how we are thinking about it. Ruth, I'm not sure you want to add more. Ruth Porat : I think that's the main point, just given the sheer scale of the opportunity and our position, investing to really position ourselves well across industries and geographies. And the key elements of it, I tried to call out in the opening comments : investing in product, go to market, data centers. And you can see it in the results. I think you're going to continue to see us building there, and that's what we're talking about building ahead. We are keenly focused on delivering for both customers and shareholders and that, of course, includes an intense focus on the path to profitability. Philipp Schindler : Yes. And on your question on YouTube, on the overall development and the subscription side, our Direct Response business on YouTube was practically nonexistent three years ago. And now it's one of our largest and fastest-growing ad offerings on YouTube. And with TrueView for action, we're actually making it easier for advertisers to unlock opportunities to reach audiences with video campaigns. And just to give you a few numbers, 60% of TrueView for action customers are new to YouTube. And we more than doubled the number of active advertisers using TrueView for action in the first 6 months of 2020. And we're really tapping into the tremendous innate commercial behavior on the platform. 70% of YouTube viewers are saying they bought a brand as a result of seeing it on YouTube. I talked about L'or\u00e9al earlier. MasterClass is another great example. Online learning has become a huge opportunity, and they use TrueView for action to connect the right people to the right content and saw really big, like 140% increase in clicks to their sites, 70% increase in sign-ups to courses and so on. YouTube continues, in our view, to be amazing for brand advertisers as well. Our brand business was hit hard in the early stages of the pandemic, rebounded in Q3 and into Q4. And it really helps advertisers reach younger audiences. They can reach anywhere. We now reach more 18- to 49-year-olds than all linear TV networks combined. Watch time is increasing. Advertiser effectiveness is getting better and better. And so this is a very nice development on the subscription strategy. Maybe just briefly, music is an incredibly popular vertical on YouTube and, obviously, a key part of the overall experience. We found that users wanted a premium YouTube experience and we -- basically the ability to download songs and videos. YouTube Premium provides additional revenue streams, of course, for music labels and publishers as well. In 2019, YouTube paid the music industry over $3 billion. We have over 30 million music and premium paid subscribers. We are now operating over 95 countries, so members get a lot of extra benefits, yes. Operator : And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : Ruth and Sundar, I just wanted to follow up on Eric's question a bit. Anything else you can add just in terms of the significant inflection that you saw on Google Cloud backlog there? And I guess, in particular, curious what you're seeing in terms of benefit and success as you're leveraging Alphabet more broadly like in the Ford deal. And then how do you think about Google Cloud margins structurally kind of long-term relative to peers? Any color there would be helpful. Sundar Pichai : Maybe I'll start with customers are looking for digital transformation. And depending on the sector they are in, they are definitely interested in a broader solution set across the breadth of what Google and Alphabet can bring. We see this in health care, our efforts in Google Health, work that's happening in Verily, all end up helping. Ford is a great example of, I'd say, thinking longer term not just for Cloud but Android auto-powering their vehicles. And so these are big transformations cutting across the company. And one of the areas where we are really executing is leveraging our global business operations that Philipp runs and partnering closely with Thomas' teams, and that's definitely brings in a lot of synergies here. On your second question, on the broader stuff, the one thing I would say is -- I mentioned a part earlier, we get into these long-term deals. And so over time, as you add more cohorts, that contributes to the margin structure. It is -- the scale of the product offerings, the number of areas and the number of regions in the world, there's a much more significant investment. And so there is definitely a fixed cost structure associated with it, and we are also investing ahead. But as we scale up the business, we expect the trends to be favorable. Operator : And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent Thill : You mentioned you accelerated -- saw accelerating brand spend in the quarter. And many investors are asking the sustainability and what you're seeing in that as you head into the beginning of this year. If you could just talk directionally in terms of how your clients are acting as they head out of the holiday season, that would be helpful. Ruth Porat : Sure. I'll take that. As we've each noted, the financial results really did reflect this increase in advertiser activity. And that was in part unlocking budgets that they had paused earlier in the year as well as really reflecting the increase in consumer online activity. The largest contributor, as Philipp mentioned, was retail, the largest contributor to the year-on-year growth of the ads business. But I would say tech, media and entertainment as well as CPG were also meaningful contributors. And for Search, we saw ongoing improvement in advertisers spend broadly. For YouTube, Direct Response, as Philipp talked about, really did maintain a very high level of growth. And the acceleration in overall YouTube revenue growth reflects a pickup in brand advertising across all verticals on top of the ongoing strength that we saw in DR. And then in network, also same point, it's this pickup in advertiser spend, as Philipp noted. It was led by growth in AdMob and Ad Manager. So we're really pleased with Q4. It was a great end to a challenging year. And when we think about 2021, I made the point in the opening comments, we obviously have easier year-on-year comparisons in the first half as we anniversary the effects of the pandemic. So not much more to add, we -- it was a strong quarter, and we feel really good about the level of activity. Operator : And our next question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry : Great. I appreciate the level of detail on the drivers behind the acceleration in Search and YouTube. I was wondering if you could go a bit further and disaggregate or give, even just qualitatively, the drivers behind that acceleration between pre-pandemic advertisers returning to prior spending levels versus new advertisers or new advertiser spend being allocated to the platform. Ruth Porat : Well, I think the main point is sort of this mega comment that we saw a slowdown. And as Philipp said, and we've talked about on prior calls, one of the first things that happens is a step-back and then you see, as users reengage and activity picks up and the effectiveness of advertising the ROI available, you see advertising come back in. I remember talking about this throughout last year that we had seen this actually going back to the prior financial crisis. And what you've seen is just a broad-based reengagement, which we're really pleased about across industries. And it's also -- as Philipp noted in his comments, there's been a tremendous opportunity really to step in here and help small, medium businesses as they were evolving and adapting to this new digital world, and it's been quite key there as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have two for Philipp. Philipp, first one, I appreciate all the color on retail and commerce, the merchant community growing so strong in the last year. I'd be curious to hear about your discussions now with merchants and sort of what the largest friction points that they're looking for you to solve and sort of continue to help them as the world reopens, kind of the merchant discussions. And then secondly, a question on one of the earlier products on Discover feed, I'd love to hear about sort of early learnings on Discover feed and how you think about hurdles you need to overcome to monetize that. Philipp Schindler : Yes. Thank you very much for the question. Look, at the highest level, we want to build a healthier e-commerce ecosystem. When people come to Google to shop, we want them to help find the best product with the best prices from really the widest range of merchants, and we want our results to be as comprehensive and relevant as possible. And we took some significant steps last year, as you know, on Google Shopping. And in many ways, we really see them as a return to our first principles here : free listing, zero commissions, really good feedback, helps lower barriers for online retail. So we've become a great place for stores to connect with potential customers whether it's by driving traffic to the website for free listings or ads or just by making it easier for purchases to happen directly on Google. And by the way, let me be clear also, shopping ads will continue to be a powerful way for retailers to promote their products, obviously. So overall, we're providing an open ecosystem that works for every kind of business, from national chains and online marketplaces to just your small local stores. And we're giving retailers more choice, which is very well received by opening our platform to third-party providers. We talked about this, starting with PayPal and Shopify. And we brought YouTube into the fold, and we began experimenting with a feature that lets you learn a lot more about products and videos on a limited set of channels and so on and so on. So I would say overall it's very, very well received. On the Discover side, discovery has grown -- so discovery is Discover and, obviously, discovery ads. So Discover has grown dramatically since we launched it, I think, just 3 years ago. People are loving how we're surfacing relevant information, gorgeous visuals that are all in what we call Coriolis feed experience. And naturally, some of these experiences are commercial. And we made discovery ads generally available about 6 months ago. I think it was May 2020. And it's already reaching up to 3 billion people across Discover, YouTube, Gmail, and that's worldwide. And advertisers love how we're able to drive performance objectives by really matching their premium creatives with Google intent on our -- yes, what we call Coriolis surfaces. Operator : And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Colin Sebastian : Maybe for Sundar or Philipp, a follow-up on YouTube. Just given the strength of those services ads and subscriptions during the pandemic, I wonder if part of what we're seeing is more of an acceleration from TV ad budgets from linear spending to more of YouTube spending, I mean given also the momentum we've seen in over-the-top over the last 9 months or so. And then given some of the changing industry dynamics around privacy, including what you've already announced around browser cookies, wondering what plans might be as well for Android and how we should think about potential impact on ad revenues broadly as a result of privacy changes. Philipp Schindler : Yes, I can take that. We've seen brands steadily shift budgets to YouTube to complement their linear TV buys as TV audiences really become more fragmented. And as traditional TV ratings continue to decline, TV advertisers are turning to streaming platforms like YouTube to reach people who are no longer watching TV. Connected TVs are our fastest-growing screen. In the U.S., we have over 100 million people that watch YouTube and YouTube TV on their TV screens each month. YouTube helps advertisers reach general audiences they can't reach anywhere else. We talked about it. YouTube reaches more 18- to 49-year-olds than all linear TV networks combined. And so there is an opportunity, a big opportunity, for YouTube to help brands and agencies really more easily connect with this audience. And we're very invested in this space. And just to give you a few examples, in the second half of last year, we launched YouTube Masthead on TV screens to help advertisers drive awareness with large audiences in basically a single moment. Many are taking advantage of it : Uber, many others. We launched Brand Lift for YouTube on TV screens to really help advertisers make informed decisions about ad performance, optimize streaming campaigns in real time and so on. And we also made it possible last year for advertisers to basically buy among the most popular YouTube and YouTube TV content viewed on the TV screens in one -- what we call one single lineup. Quickly on the third-party cookies strategy in general, we know that expectations are really changing for how data is used online, and people are demanding greater privacy. We're taking our responsibility to user privacy and to supporting our partners in the web ecosystem very, very seriously. In 2019, we announced The Privacy Sandbox, which is an open standards initiative to invent new technology that will replace third-party cookies with a set of privacy-preserving mechanisms for the web, and we're making great progress. We've shared a detailed proposal with the industry for experimentation and feedback. We shared recently as well our what we call FLoC, our Federated Learning of Cohorts API, which we think provides an effective replacement signal for third-party cookies. And we really believe Privacy Sandbox is the best path forward, and we remain very committed to our collaboration with the ads community on privacy-preserving open standard mechanisms that can, what we call, sustain a healthy and ad-supported web. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Michael Nathanson : Philipp, I was following up on Colin's question just perfectly. I wanted to understand the framework, if you could, and think about the bigger opportunity longer term and priority highs -- priority is in streaming video, right? So are you happy with the progress of YouTube TV so far? Will you expand into other countries? And can you contrast that versus the opportunity you see in connected TVs and devices as you've done for Google TV or Chromecast? And then is there a perceived added value from advertisers for this type of inventory? Does it attract a new type of advertiser to offer YouTube TV inventory or connected TV inventory from the traditional YouTube advertising? Sundar Pichai : Yes, maybe I'll comment on -- one of the things which has worked well for Google over the years is we really try to reach users where they are, and that's how Google has worked always. We've invested across platforms, across devices, across countries. And I think the same applies for the YouTube experience. We want to bring it to the screen that's most convenient for users and, hence, our investments in Google TV, Chromecast, YouTube TV as a whole itself. And I think we are taking a long-term view here, obviously focused on the user experience and really getting it all to work well. We know -- while smartphones are at the center for YouTube, TV is an important form factor. And over time, people will use it across multiple screens. And so that's the experience we are focused on. And any time we create that experience, we know, over time, there is value to be captured commercially as well that makes sense for advertisers, but we take a long-term view. Philipp Schindler : Yes. And I talked about the connected TV part already. Maybe briefly just on YouTube TV, YouTube TV continues to gain momentum. Our advertising efforts on YouTube TV itself are still very, very early. But we think there is an opportunity to apply some of our targeting and measurement capabilities to really provide a better user and advertiser experience over time. And yes, we heard from customers, they have a very strong interest in advertising and streaming environments. I mentioned how we combine it in the single lineups. So that's an interesting path going forward. Operator : And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Stephen Ju : So Sundar, I think let's -- I think you've recently talked about a 10- to 20-year journey for AI and quantum computing to unlock new use cases. I think you brought up in the past some of the ways AI is helping you with the products that you have in market right now. But as we take a more longer-term look into the future, what do you think some of the new applications could be? And I think, Philipp, it might have been a few years ago when you were speaking at an investor conference, and you called out the desire to onboard and help SMBs, particularly as they really had no way to advertise before. And Google, and online in general, presented a golden opportunity to really help them grow their business. So where do you think you are in terms of putting together an easy-to-use set of tools to help those who otherwise don't really have agency representation so that they can reach all the different customers that they should be reaching across all of the different services that you're offering? Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Stephen. I'll answer the AI part first. We've always wanted to be foundational in how we approach technological advances, and that's the core competency. We invest across the company. We're one of the largest R&D investors in the world. And obviously, AI is a big part of it. Just I'm really excited that we -- over the past few years, while we have made progress in understanding different modalities, be it text, images, voice, vision, et cetera, there is -- we definitely -- I think we are at an inflection point, and we are investing to build better models and deepen our understanding and do it in a more generalized way. And when we do that, it will apply horizontally across our products. You saw a version of that when we shipped Bird in Search in what was one of our biggest quality improvements, but you'll see that flow across be it Google Search, YouTube, Android as well as our investments in Alphabet, be it self-driving cars or robotics. So we take that view and, definitely, we want to make sure we are driving state-of-the-art progress. Philipp? Philipp Schindler : Yes. So first, let me recognize, I mean it has obviously been a very, very challenging environment for SMBs. Many weren't online. Many lost line of sight to demand overnight due to COVID. So around this time last year, as soon as we saw the scale of the impact, we really accelerated product that give our customers, and especially our SMB customers, signals to help them actually navigate and pivot. And as I noted earlier, as more consumers moved online and advertisers obviously responded by reactivating spend, we also saw our advertiser base grow, particularly the number of smaller advertisers or SMBs, and we're helping them see shift in supply and demand not just across sectors but actually within sectors. For example, travel continues to get hit hard, hit pretty hard. And after the initial lockdown last year, searches for vacation homes and near-me rentals saw huge spikes, and that continues to fluctuate. On the other hand, if we look at retail, demand isn't disappearing. It's shifting in many cases. We're seeing increases in searches for things like gym equipment, crafts, patio heaters and so on, anything related to outdoor activity and so on. We're obviously thinking about how to help SMBs on products like Maps. Like, over the last 5 years, we've made more than 1,000 improvements to business profiles, making it a lot easier for merchants to connect with customers and especially now into the crisis. In 2020, we added new features to, for example, provide COVID updates, service changes and new attributes like takeout, delivery, curbside pickup, now all easily available for consumers on Maps to connect them to their favorite SMBs, so a really incredible investment, frankly, from our side, and I think it's very well received. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks. James Friedland : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2021 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jim Friedland : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai; Philipp Schindler; and Ruth Porat. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. After hard year, people in some parts of the world are beginning to rebuild their lives, businesses and communities. But recovery is far from uniform across the globe as the tragic scenes in countries like India and Brazil remind us. We are continuing to help support public health officials in their vital and urgent work. Our focus is on providing authoritative information. We are helping over 100 government agencies and non-profits worldwide, distribute critical information and billions of PSAs about COVID-19 and vaccines, and Google Cloud technologies powering a virtual agent to help make vaccination appointments over the phone, supporting 28 languages and dialects for those with limited internet access. We are focused on doing our part to help. In some parts of the world, the economy began to rebound, which created a rising tide in the first quarter that benefited a number of sectors, including existing and emerging companies and partners. For example, data suggests that investment in startups is at an all-time high. Our product releases are returning to a regular cadence. I am particularly excited that our developer event Google IO is back this year, all virtual and free for everyone on May 18th through 20th. We will have significant product updates and announcements and I invite you all to tune in. Today, I will briefly mention a few highlights from the past quarter and go a bit deeper on Cloud. Then Philip will discuss advertising and partnership developments. Finally, Ruth will cover the quarterly results. Quickly turning to product highlights of the quarter. Our knowledge and information services like Search and Maps remain at the heart of our mission to provide helpful and accurate information during important moments. Philipp Schindler : Thanks, Sundar, and good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s great to be joining you again today. We are pleased with a strong growth in Google Services revenues in the first quarter. Year-on-year performance reflects elevated consumer online activity, broad-based strength and advertiser spend, and lapping of the initial impact of the pandemic on advertising revenues that began in March last year. In the first quarter in Search, we saw sustained strength across most categories led by retail. We also saw strong performance in tech and CPG. In YouTube, we had phenomenal growth driven by Direct Response, followed by continued strength in brand. We have seen great momentum in TrueView for action ads, with a number of advertisers using the format doubling over the past year. In Network exceptional growth was driven by AdMob and Ad Manager with particular strength in app campaigns. Google other revenues were driven by growth in Google Play and YouTube\u2019s non-advertising revenues, followed by hardware. I would now like to take a few minutes to dive deeper into the trends we are seeing in our business. As Sundar touched on earlier, the pandemic is evolving in different ways across the world. Some countries are in advanced stages of reopening, others are facing reacceleration of cases and there\u2019s everything in between. It\u2019s never been more important to help businesses navigate the pandemic as circumstances change. On travel, we are starting to see a renewed interest from users as they turn to Google to plan their next trip, even before they are ready to book. Every travel partner is looking to understand where demand is going and we are helping them find these opportunities through insights and automation. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Philipp. Our very strong financial results in the first quarter reflect both lapping the impact of COVID on our business beginning in March 2020, as well as the benefit of excellent underlying operating performance. My focus will be on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $55.3 billion, up 34% or up 32% in constant currency, reflecting elevated consumer activity online and broad-based increases in advertiser spending within Google Services, as well as ongoing strength in Google Cloud. Our total cost of revenues was $24.1 billion up 27%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $14.4 billion up 25%, followed by TAC, which was $9.7 billion, up 30%. Within Other cost of revenues, the biggest factors are, first, content acquisition costs, primarily driven by costs for YouTube\u2019s advertising supported content, followed by costs for subscription content. And second, costs associated with data centers and other operations, offset partially by a reduction in depreciation expense due to changes to estimated useful lives of servers in certain network equipment. Operating expenses were $14.8 billion, up 4%. In terms of the three component parts of OpEx. First, the increase in R&D expenses was driven primarily by headcount growth. Second, sales and marketing expenses were essentially flat, reflecting headcount growth, which was offset by lower spend on ads and promo, as well as on travel and entertainment. Finally, the decline in G&A reflects the benefit of lapping the unusually high allowances for credit losses recorded in the first quarter of 2020 due to the impact of COVID offset by charges relating to certain legal matters. Headcount was up 4,694 from the fourth quarter, including more than 1,800 Fitbit employees who joined us in Q1. Again, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. Operating income was $16.4 billion, up 106% and our operating margin in the quarter was 30%. Other income and expense was $4.8 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was $17.9 billion. Operating cash flow was $19.3 billion, with free cash flow of $13.3 billion in the quarter and $50.7 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the first quarter with $135 billion in cash and marketable securities. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $51.2 billion up 34%, consisting of Google Search and other advertising revenues of $31.9 billion in the quarter up 30%, with strength across most categories led by retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $6 billion up 49%, driven by exceptional performance in Direct Response and ongoing strength in brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $6.8 billion up 30%, driven by AdMob and Ad Manager. Other revenues were $6.5 billion up 46%, primarily driven by growth in Play and YouTube non-advertising revenues followed by hardware, which benefited from the addition of Fitbit revenues. Google Services operating income was $19.5 billion, up 69% and the operating margin was 38%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, including GCP and Google Workspace, revenues were $4 billion for the first quarter up 46%. GCP\u2019s revenue growth was again meaningfully above Cloud overall. Strong growth in Google Workspace revenues was driven by growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $1 billion. As to our Other Bets, in the first quarter, revenues were $198 million. The operating loss was $1.1 billion. Let me end with our outlook for each segment and our investments more broadly. For Google Services, for the remainder of 2021, year-over-year comparisons will be affected meaningfully by the impact of COVID last year, with a greater benefit in Q2 from an easier comp relative to what you saw in Q1 and then beginning to lap stronger performance in the second half of the year. In the first quarter, we continue to benefit from elevated consumer online activity and broad-based strength in advertiser spend. It is too early to say how durable this consumer behavior will be as economies recover and restrictions on mobility are lifted. Within Other revenues, Play benefited from an increased level of user engagement starting in Q1 last year due to the pandemic, which we are now beginning to lap. In terms of investment levels within Google Services, we still intend to invest aggressively to support the extraordinary opportunities we see. That being said, in some areas, like, travel and entertainment and marketing events, the pace of investment through the balance of the year may be affected by the pace of COVID recovery globally. As for Google Cloud, our approach to building the business has not changed. We remain focused on revenue growth and we will continue to invest aggressively in products and our go-to-market organization, given the opportunity we see. The operating results in Q1, in part reflects some notable items in the quarter. First, the lapping of the unusually high allowances for credit losses recorded in the first quarter of 2020, as I already mentioned. And second, lower depreciation expense due to the change in the estimated useful lives. Although, the dollar benefit will diminish throughout the course of the year across segments. As we have noted previously, operating results should benefit from increased scale over time. However, at this point, we do remain focused on continuing to invest to build the cloud organization for long-term performance. In terms of Other Bets, we continue to invest with a focus on the long-term value creation opportunity. Turning to CapEx, at a consolidated level, the results reflect ongoing investment in our technical infrastructure, offset by a slower pace of investment in office facilities, given the ongoing impact of COVID. Within technical infrastructure, servers continue to be the largest driver of investment, as we continue to invest to support Cloud, Search, Ads and machine learning. Finally, with respect to capital allocation, our primary use of capital continues to be to support organic growth in our businesses, followed by retaining flexibility for acquisitions and investments. We complement these growth drivers with a return of capital. As we indicated in our press release today, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $50 billion of our Class C stock. Thank you. And now, Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions. Operator : Thank you.  And our first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First one for Sundar. I appreciate the color on the four key priorities. I wanted to dig a little more into the build and provide the most helpful products and services. Maybe if you can sort of talk to us about Search, how do you think about the key investment priorities and innovation areas to continue to make Search more and more helpful for your users and your advertisers? And the second one for Philipp, maybe similar question on YouTube. You\u2019ve done such a great job in innovation around YouTube. Where do you see the largest incremental opportunities for further innovation at YouTube to deliver more outsized value for your advertisers? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Thanks. On Search, great question. I still think we are in very early stages. Recent example, which I was proud of was when the ship was stuck in the Suez Canal and then it got out. If you ask the question to Google, I think, very soon after that we had the right answer. It seems obvious to do except we need to provide right answers and without giving wrong answers or misinformation for many other things. So to do that is where all our underlying investments go and that\u2019s how we think about it over the long-term. BERT last year, I think, was a great example of it. It was one of our biggest quality improvements and that was based on the transformer breakthrough from our Google AI team, which laid the foundation for it. So we are continuing to invest that way in the deep technology as the web is scaling up. There\u2019s more information than ever before. So that\u2019s a big part of what we are doing. Beyond that, there is a lot of opportunity to improve the user experience. You have seen our efforts around shopping. That\u2019s one aspect of how we are working hard to improve the experience there. So - but we are looking at it pretty deeply. Philipp? Philipp Schindler : Yes. On the YouTube side, let me start with our Direct Response business, growth was truly exceptional this quarter. DR was practically non-existent on YouTube a few years ago and it\u2019s now a large and fast-growing business and we are just getting started in my view. People already, as you know, go to YouTube to decide what they want to buy, and we want to make it easier for them to buy and make the discovery process overall a lot easier. And for creators, we launched new shoppable capabilities. So viewers can actually make purchases from their favorite creators directly on YouTube. Just as an example, as part of our Brand Connect program, Calvin Klein tested these and drove over. I think it was, 200% lift in brand search and sold out multiple products actually. For merchants, they can now bring their product feeds directly into their video campaigns and I think we are still scratching the surface on what\u2019s possible really with commercial intent on YouTube. And then there is, of course, the opportunity to be a major platform for brands. Historical approaches to reaching audiences through, let\u2019s just say, call it, linear TV don\u2019t really work anymore. Advertisers are using YouTube now to reach the audience they can\u2019t find anywhere else. And remember, more 18- to 49-year-olds are actually watching YouTube than all linear TV combined and brands are also seeing more incremental reach on YouTube compared to TV. So we are starting to see advertisers by a mix actually of awareness and more action-oriented formats. They are driving reach and results across the funnel from awareness to consideration to action. So we see a lot of really interesting opportunities here. Brian Nowak : Great. Thank you both. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. First, Ruth, just want to ask you about Cloud. You saw some significant benefits just from the change in useful life. But I think in the past, you talked about 1Q perhaps being the biggest loss of the year. I was just curious if that\u2019s still the case in your view going forward? And then, secondly, just given the management transition that we have seen at Waymo, should we expect any change in terms of how things are operated there going forward? Thank you. Ruth Porat : Thanks for the question. So in terms of Cloud and overall performance, I think, the main point I would say is, I wouldn\u2019t extrapolate generally from quarter-to-quarter, given we are still in the early stages of building the business. We do intend to continue to invest meaningfully in Cloud given the opportunity. And so, as you said, there were a couple of things that benefited margins in the quarter, both the depreciation expense item, but also lapping the unusually high allowance for credit losses that were recorded back in the first quarter. So, the main takeaway is we are continuing to invest. We will invest aggressively in products and go-to-market where we have talked about quite consistently over time. And it\u2019s much as operating losses and operating margin will benefit from increased scale over time. At this point, we do remain focused on investing to build the organization for long-term performance. Sundar Pichai : And Doug on Waymo, John is stepping down our CEO and it\u2019s been -- he\u2019s been planning for this transition, and Dmitri and Tekedra have been working closely with him. And so, we will continue our investments there. Pretty excited that the fully autonomous experience of Waymo One is available in Phoenix and we are also accelerating the development of our next-generation Waymo Driver to deploy it in San Francisco. And this past quarter, Waymo had begun limited rider testing in San Francisco. And so really focused on making sure we make the hard technical progress, so that we can operationalize this and so we will continue as executing towards that. Doug Anmuth : Okay. Thank you both. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Thanks. As it relates to some of the harder hit industries, I am curious if you could just characterize the shape of the recovery what you are seeing across travel and in some of the other sectors? And have there been any verticals that you have yet to see recover that may pullout in the second-half of the year? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So, overall, what we indicated is the strong results reflect, in part lapping the impact that we saw starting late in Q1 of last year and then a pickup in a number of areas. I think the main thing we would want to leave you with is that, we are seeing, in part an acceleration in the shift to digital, but it\u2019s too early to forecast the extent to which these changes in consumer behavior and advertising spend will endure. There are some obvious examples, if you think about, for example, the bump in consumption for things like outfitting your home to work-from-home, obviously, that doesn\u2019t repeat. And so our main thing is that we think it\u2019s premature at this point to really assess that how durable this consumer behavior trends are. Brent Thill : In travel, specifically, have you -- can you just give us any color in terms of what you are seeing on that front? Ruth Porat : Yes. Nothing more to add. Philipp had a couple of comments about some of the areas where we are trying to innovate to be helpful to our partners, but beyond that nothing to add. Brent Thill : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Maybe one for Philipp and one for Ruth. First, Philipp, you mentioned a couple of times the durability of the improvement is tough to gauge. Maybe you can help us understand what the key drivers of Search that you are thinking about over the next couple of years? Is it queries, product improvements, certain changes in verticals like shopping? How are you thinking about driving Search growth? And then maybe for Ruth, model showed great efficiency last year on the cost side and margins. Anything you are learning or experiences during the pandemic that we can think about post-pandemic on cost efficiencies or things like that? Thank you. Philipp Schindler : Yes. Thank you. Thank you so much for the question. I usually look at the different components of Search as basically four key drivers. The first one obviously being the queries, so are we really the best place for users to turn to when they need information. The second one is, I would call it, as coverage. So what percent of coverage is really commercial and then what percentage are we actually covering with ads. And then we need to ask ourselves, do both of these have upside. The third one is click-through rates or individual. At click-through rates close to being optimized, is there more we can do it here by just delivering better creative, better ads, better answers, to what extent can we deploy next-generation machine learning here. And then the last one is obviously the CPC, right? How much is someone willing to bid for click on their ad and this is obviously to a large extent driven by the quality of traffic we are sending, and then conversion rate is a big driver of this. So we are working very closely with our partners, advertisers and so on across the world to help them optimize their conversion rates and their O/I. Those are really the four big components and I am excited about all four of them actually. Ruth Porat : In terms of your question on efficiency, appreciate the question. I think, at the highest level, the approach is unchanged. Our approach on investing capital allocation is first and foremost to support long-term growth with financially sustainable businesses. It\u2019s about being sharper within product areas and then making sure we are investing. And what I keep referring to is operational excellence, things like our technical infrastructure, systems to improve productivity, to improve velocity of our product teams and then the very important efforts around privacy and security and content moderation. And I think, to your question, the experiences of this past year underscored really the value of having made those investments to protect and support operational excellence. It really served us well and customers in our ability to deliver throughout this period of time. So that framework is unaltered. I think that part of what you are seeing in the first quarter, I have said it a couple of times now, but are some notable items in the quarter. The lapping of the allowance for credit losses, the benefit from depreciation life and then there were certain things that were due to COVID just the lower impact for things like T&E and marketing. And so the main point is we will continue to invest for long-term growth, so that in both areas, Google Services and Cloud, and we will continue to maintain that framework that you referenced about looking for efficiencies where they are, but ensuring that we can deliver for users and customers. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is now open. Colin Sebastian : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Sundar, first, you have highlighted for years that machine learning is clearly a strength and differentiation of the overall platform, including in Cloud Services, where we are also seeing competitors focus more on their capabilities here. So I am wondering if you could talk about the pace of change around data science and how Google can sustain its competitive advantage in those areas? And then, Philipp, I wanted to follow-up on the momentum in Search that you attribute to Google Shopping. Is it fair to say that the shift to free product listings has led to the desired increase in retail advertising across the platform or are there other reasons beyond the pandemic that you attribute for that success? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Colin, on -- thanks. Obviously, as we are thinking about AI, it all starts with foundational R&D we do. I think we are one of the largest R&D investors in AI in the world. And so thinking ahead and doing that and we are doing it across all the foundational areas and we are taking many diverse approaches. So as we make breakthroughs, I earlier spoke about transformers and how that translated as BERT to improve search quality. And similarly we are very committed to taking the AI improvements and bringing it through our GCP offerings to our enterprise customers as well. So it\u2019s an approach we are deeply committed to and we are thinking as it -- at all layers of the stack. So this is why you see us work hard on TPUs and we think about the tool chain for developers on top of all that. And so -- and I think if I look at the progress ahead, I think, there\u2019s a lot more progress coming down the pipe and so I am pretty excited and that\u2019s why I feel Google -- GCP will be differentiated over time as our competitive advantage. Philipp, over to you. Philipp Schindler : Yes. And on the Shopping side, look, it\u2019s been a year since we brought Bill onboard, Bill Ready and we pivoted our Shopping strategy to better support retailers and consumers, trying to really build an open retail ecosystem and we are pleased with the progress we are making. As you said, free listings and zero commissions have actually lowered various online retail. Shopping ads continue to be a powerful way for retailers to promote their products and the combination of free and paid is a meaningful one. We had a set of new partnerships with Shopify and PayPal that are giving retailers a lot more choice. And we will continue to simplify the, let me call it, end-to-end user and merchant experience, of course. In particular, we are trying to streamline and working hard to streamline the back-end experience for merchants, especially for hybrid retailers. So, retailers that play in both brick-and-mortar and in digital. And overall we want to make it much, much easier for retailers to get started on Google and have their information appear across surfaces and I mentioned overall strength in retail before. So thank you. Colin Sebastian : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from ISI. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. I wanted to ask about your attempts to retain advertisers, and I ask it this way, I think, we have had record numbers of new business formations in the country and around the world on the unfortunate impact of COVID. But I think that\u2019s my guess is, it\u2019s been a huge tailwind for your business? At the same time we have had this real tip over I think of linear TV ad budgets in the back half of the year onto online channels like YouTube. So talk about these new advertisers that you have brought on to the Google platform? What you have been able to do? How confident you are in your ability to retain them, you are advertiser retention strategy? Thanks a lot. Philipp Schindler : So, I can take this. I mean a lot of the new advertisers that you are referring to are obviously SMBs and there is no doubt that this has been a challenging year for SMBs. The pandemic has disrupted how many of them connect with their customers. But frankly, the pandemic has also been a catalyst for key consumer trends. Obviously, creating a lot of new opportunities for small businesses, and obviously, consumers are spending more time online. They are buying more online. They were willing to try new brands and they are eager to support local businesses, SMBs. So searches for support local businesses are up significantly since last year and we have been focused really on helping SMBs with simpler tools, so they can actually embrace digital a lot faster. And that\u2019s where we have really invested over the year, making everything simpler. We had a very wide range of solutions to help them get online, get discovered across all of our key product, Search, Maps, YouTube and so on. There is multiple, multiple fascinating stories from them coming back to us and we see this positively reflected in our rates here as well. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you, Philipp. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Michael Nathanson : Thank you. I have two, one, Philipp, one for Ruth. So on -- the question is on Search. I wonder if we step back, which categories, which geographies, do you think you are still underrepresented as a percentage of marketing spending, where we could see potentially even more lift to come? And then to Ruth, we always asked in the past that CapEx spending in order to change useful life. But I wonder has this pandemic change maybe your approach to the office space that you bought and thinking about how the company is going to deploy capital in terms of space going forward and how we think about the future of CapEx next couple of years based on post-pandemic? Ruth Porat : Philipp seems to be on mute. I will go ahead and start on the CapEx\u2026 Michael Nathanson : Okay. Yes . Ruth Porat : \u2026 question. Michael Nathanson : Thank you. Ruth Porat : So, in terms of CapEx, I think, I will address two parts. You asked about office facilities, but I do think it\u2019s important to know, we are continuing to invest in our technical infrastructure and that\u2019s what you saw again here this quarter and we will continue to do so to support growth that we are seeing in Cloud, in Search, in Ads and machine learning, no change there. So you will be seeing that. But the core of your question was really about office facilities and I think it\u2019s -- we have been very clear, we do value bringing people together in the office and we are looking at a hybrid work-from-home/work-from-office model. As we look forward at developing our real estate footprint for offices, what we factor into it is, first, we are growing our headcount, we are looking at less density per employee. So even with a hybrid work environment, we will continue to need space and so we are continuing to build out our campuses and office facilities. What you saw in the first quarter was a slightly slower pace for that and a slower pace on fit-outs, as well as we are evolving what does the space look like. But we expect to continue to pick up the pace there as we fit out our spaces for this kind of a new re-imagined environment. So we will continue to be investing in campuses around the globe as we have been. Philipp Schindler : Yes. And on your first part of your question, look, we are looking at our business from a very global perspective and are excited about it. Keep in mind, we are not just addressing above the line marketing budgets from an addressable market perspective, so not just traditional advertising, TV advertising and so on. Below the line budgets are really significant, everything promotional pricing, product placements, sponsorships and so on and so on. So there is this massive acceleration in e-commerce due to the pandemic. Still more than 80% of commerce is still offline. So there is a huge opportunity here across the world for us to tap into those other budgets. There are really traditional use in a very different context. So there is plenty of room for growth here and I talked about how we look at it from a query\u2019s perspective from a commercial instant -- intent perspective. We are trying to use machine learning really smartly here. But the real focus in the end has to be, how do we actually make our partner successful, how do we drive incremental ROI for them and as long as we continue this well, I think, we should continue to see budgets move our way as well. Michael Nathanson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Brian Fitzgerald : Hi, guys. You mentioned the strength in the supply side products in the Network business. I am wondering if you might be able to comment on how the demand side products are doing. And maybe in a similar vein, some of the changes you have made in that technology over the last few years? May have had the effect of drawing some of your advertiser customers more deeply into your tech stack, wondering if this is also creating a strong on ramp in GCP specifically around data analytic products like BigQuery? Thanks. Ruth Porat : So in terms of overall on Network revenues, as I think I noted briefly in opening comments, what we are really seeing is the ongoing strength in advertiser spend, both Philipp and I talked about that. Particularly what we saw was AdMob and Ad Manager, and particular strength in app campaigns. And all of this just underscores what each of us commented on that. The results do reflect what was broad based strength across our partners\u2019 properties in the first quarter. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks, Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks. Jim Friedland : Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2021 call. Thank you and have a good evening. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jim Friedland : Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Jim. And good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s good to be with you. Today, I'll give an overview of the quarter, going through some of our product momentum, then touching on Cloud and YouTube. First, I want to acknowledge that the new COVID-19 variants have been challenging for so many communities across the world. As the pandemic evolves, we want to help people get the information they need to keep themselves and their families safe. I really encourage everyone to get the vaccine when it's available to you. Turning to the quarter, we saw a rising tide of online consumer and business activity. We are proud that our services helped so many businesses and partners. In fact, we set a number of records this quarter. This quarter, publisher partners earned more than they ever have from our network. We also paid more to YouTube creators and partners than in any quarter in our history. And on top of that, over the past year, we have sent more traffic to third-party websites than any year prior, in addition to generating billions of direct connections like phone calls, directions, ordering food and making reservations that drove customers and revenue to businesses around the world that are working to get back on their feet. A few years ago, we placed a bet on AI believing that it would be a fundamental technology that would underpin and dramatically improve all our products. That vision was on full display at our I/O event in May where we announced new advancements that will be helpful to people and businesses everywhere. As one example, we introduced Multitask Unified Models or MUM. MUM is a big advancement in Search, a thousand times more powerful than our current systems. It has the ability to learn and transfer knowledge across 75 languages, which means that it can learn from sources in one language and help bring that information to you in another. Philipp Schindler : Thanks, Sundar. And hello, everyone. It's great to be with you today. We are pleased with the growth in Google Services revenues in the second quarter. Year-on-year performance reflects elevated consumer online activity, broad based strength in advertiser spend and the lapping of the first ever revenue decline in our Ads business last year due to COVID. In the second quarter, retail, again, was by far the largest contributor to the year-on-year growth of our Ads business. Travel, financial services and media and entertainment were also strong contributors. Let's now take a few minutes to talk about the trends we've seen across our business. Over the last 18 months, we've been deeply focused on helping businesses, big and small, navigate profound change. First, as a lifeline during the pandemic, and now, as a partner to reaccelerate growth as the world begins to reopen. The road to global recovery is likely to be uneven and unpredictable. That's why the real-time insights we've put in the hands of businesses going into the pandemic will be just as important coming out of it. New tools like Travel Insights, which launched in the US this month after rolling out to select countries in APAC and EMEA in December, are helping our partners get a clearer picture of where demand is coming from. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Philipp. Our strong revenue performance in the second quarter reflects lapping the impact of COVID on our business, elevated consumer online activity, broad-based strength in advertiser spend, as well as the benefit of excellent ongoing execution by our teams. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I state otherwise. We'll start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook. For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $61.9 billion, up 62%, or up 57% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenue was $26.2 billion, up 41%, primarily driven by growth in TAC, which was $10.9 billion, up 63%, followed by growth in other cost of revenues, which was $15.3 billion, up 29%, the largest driver of which was content acquisition costs. Operating expenses were $16.3 billion, up 22%. In terms of the three component parts of OpEx, first, the increase in R&D expenses was driven primarily by headcount growth. Second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses was due primarily to the ramp-up of spending on ads and promo in contrast to the pullback in the second quarter last year. Finally, the increase in G&A reflects the impact of charges relating to legal matters. Headcount was up 4,061 from the first quarter. Operating income was $19.4 billion, up 203%, and our operating margin in the quarter was 31%. Other income and expense was $2.6 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was $18.5 billion. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $57.1 billion, up 63%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $35.8 billion in the quarter were up 68%, with broad-based strength across our business, led again by strong growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $7 billion were up 84%, driven by brand, followed by direct response. Network advertising revenues of $7.6 billion were up 60%, driven by Ad Manager and AdMob. Other revenues were $6.6 billion, up 29%, primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues, followed by hardware, which benefited from the addition of Fitbit revenues. And finally, Google Play, which lapped the increased level of user engagement that started in Q1 last year due to the pandemic. Google Services operating income was $22.3 billion, up 134%, and the operating margin was 39%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $4.6 billion for the second quarter, up 54%. GCP's revenue growth was again above Cloud overall, reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Once again, strong growth in Google Workspace revenues was driven by robust growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $591 million. As to our Other Bets in the first quarter, revenues were $192 million, the operating loss was $1.4 billion. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. In the second quarter, revenues benefited from an FX tailwind of more than 4% at the consolidated level. Based on FX spot rates against the dollar relative to the third quarter of last year, we expect a more muted tailwind to revenues in the third quarter. In terms of outlook by segment, for Google Services, the benefit to revenue growth in Q2 from lapping the effect of COVID last year will diminish through the balance of the year as we begin to lap stronger performance in the second half of 2020. In the second quarter, we continued to benefit from elevated consumer online activity and broad-based strength in advertiser spend. We believe it is still too early to forecast the longer term trends as markets reopen, especially given the recent increase in COVID cases globally. Within other revenues, Play revenue growth for the balance of the year will face headwinds due to the impact of lapping elevated engagement in the pandemic, as well as the change in fee structure, which was implemented as of July 1. We continue to invest across Google services to support the extraordinary opportunities we see. A couple of reminders consistent with prior years, we expect that headcount additions will be seasonally higher in Q3 as we bring on new graduates. In addition, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year, in part, to support product launches in the holiday season. As for Google Cloud, we remain focused on revenue growth and are pleased with the trends we are seeing. Across Cloud, we will continue to invest aggressively, given the opportunity we see. Turning to CapEx. The results in the second quarter primarily reflect ongoing investment in our technical infrastructure, most notably in servers, to support ongoing growth across Google. We also began to increase the pace of investment in ground up construction and fit outs of office facilities, which were slowed due to COVID and are focused now on advances  Turning to cash and capital allocation. We continue to generate strong free cash flow of $16.4 billion in the quarter and $58.5 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the second quarter with $136 billion in cash and marketable securities. As we indicated in our press release today, our Board has approved an amendment to the existing $50 billion stock repurchase program permitting us to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner that's in the best interest of the company and its stockholders. Thank you. And now, Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions. Operator : Thank you.  And our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my question. I have two. One for Sundar and one for Philipp. Sundar, the first one is you've had so much innovation over the years using AI to improve Search and improve the overall business. Can you just give us some examples of where you still see low hanging fruit or areas for further improvement in the company's overall products using AI, et cetera, over the next couple of years? And then, Philipp, your comments on omnichannel were pretty loud and clear. Give us some examples of where you're most focus to continue to enable more retailers to move in the omnichannel sort of drive that side of the business? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Brian, thanks. You know, a couple. We see so much headroom given our bet on AI, going to our most important product of all, Search. When you see the launch of Bird, which was a significant improvement, and we are following that up with MUM, which is another extraordinary advance. So the rate information is growing, pretty rapidly. And so constantly developing better models to improve our search quality ranking, et cetera, is one of the most important ways we invest. Beyond that, I would say, all the work we are doing into making sure computers can understand in a multimodal way, be it images, audio, text, video, and then bringing it across our products, I think, is an important way we'll approach it. Philipp? Philipp Schindler : Yes. And to my part of the question, look, we want to make sure that when people come to Google, they are able to basically find the best products and prices available from, frankly, the widest possible range of merchants. And we're making strong progress under Bill's leadership. And as I said earlier, 2020 was about removing financial barriers. We made listings free, removed commission fees. And it's worth pointing out the upside of combining free listings with shopping ads actually. Merchants that used both in Q1 saw a 50% lift in clicks once they started, I think that's pretty impressive. 2021, as I said, has been about removing integration barriers. We have the partnerships with Shopify, Square, BigCommerce, GoDaddy, WooCommerce and so on. And they're making it easier for businesses to get started with us, whether it's across Search and Shopping and image search and YouTube. And then once merchants are onboarded, I mean, there's so much more value we can offer them. We launched a new measurement tools to help retailers better understand performance and pricing. You asked specifically a question about focus areas. And then we're making the product and user experience better, not only with our UI/UX research feedback with our tech and AI capabilities. And maybe a cool example is how we're using AR to bring in-store experiences online, like with auto dealerships, and then letting users really try before they buy. And we do this in cosmetics and in apparel categories. And we have the shopping graph, which I mentioned earlier. We think it will open up completely new product experiences across Google. Shopping with Lens is one example. You can shop your screen shots or use your phone camera to find the dress or pair of sneakers that caught your eye or whatever. And we're working hard to build an open retail ecosystem, and that really levels the playing field for all merchants, and we think there is a lot of opportunity ahead. And I think those are our biggest areas of focus. Brian Nowak : Great. Thank you, both. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Doug Anmuth : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I have two. First, just I think the key initiative over the last couple of years has been to bring the full breadth of Google Services to customers. So I was hoping you could talk more just about - when you think about the Search and overall ads recovery, and then also growth in Google Cloud, how those efforts are going as you work across businesses with corporate customers and what their reception has been? And then, Ruth, just on costs kind of in the back half and going forward, as you think about bringing some of these costs back, just curious if you can comment more around some of the puts and takes as you think about the overall cost structure pre COVID versus post COVID? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Yeah. Thanks, Doug. I would say, overall, as you realize, it's a broad digital shift, customers are looking for digital transformation. And depending on the sector they are in, they look to Alphabet as a digital partner, and we try to bring the broader solution set that's possible across our capabilities, and that's been working well. You mentioned Cloud, most of our Cloud customers are either in conversations with us. It could be because they're concerned about security on their supply chain or they're trying to understand the shift to digital and invest more in data analytics. Or the shift to hybrid workforce is what's probably getting them to think about Workspace and so on. And if they are retailers, we can bring in our expertise across ads, the work we are doing on commerce to be - with the partnerships we have, and so we can bring those additional expertise to bear. And so that's a trend we are seeing across. Philipp gave examples of our telco partnerships. And so across our priority verticals, we are able to engage in a broad way. And maybe the recent Google-wide partnership with Univision was another example of a multiyear, multi-product partnership with companies. Ruth Porat : And with respect to the second question, how we think about investments in the back half. Really, the driving focus is how do we support near term, long term quality growth. And I think it's important to note that some of our costs are less variable in the short term, such as depreciation and the operations cost of our data centers. So when you look at Q2 performance, in part, the meaningful year-on-year improvement in the operating margin in the second quarter, clearly reflects the strong revenue growth, but also the fact that some of these costs are less variable in the short term. However, to support long term growth, and very much to your question, it's true across both Google Services and Google Cloud, we will continue to increase the pace of investment. And that's true in headcount, it's true with compute, sales and marketing, really across the board. And you also heard that in some of my comments about CapEx. We're continuing to pick up the pace of investment in office facilities. Both fit outs and ground up construction have been slowed as a result of COVID, and we're pleased that the pace has picked up, and that really relates to our comments about continuing to build out across the US, around the globe, in line with continuing to invest in headcount growth. I'd make one other point, which is, I think you're aware of this, but in this quarter, the results also reflect the benefit from the change in useful lives that we talked about earlier in the year that reduced depreciation expense. It's a benefit of about $721 million in the quarter, and the benefit from this change will be lower in the second half as you're looking ahead. Doug Anmuth : Great. Thank you, Sundar and Ruth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple, when you look at Search in the quarter, it really accelerated beyond the comp. And if you look at it quarter-over-quarter, it was really good. So wondering if there's any products or verticals that really surprised you, or things to call out. And how do you think about the sustainability here, specifically in Search and the product pipeline from here? And then secondly, on Cloud, really saw a nice margin improvement there. How do you feel about where you are on the infrastructure side and ability to really continue to show kind of that improvement in margins over time? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Two questions, maybe I'll take the second first. On the Cloud side, first of all, we do investments in our infrastructure. First of all, we are doing it across a set of cloud services we are building for Google. And it's the same that we bring to Cloud, and so there's tremendous synergies we have there. And maybe to give you an example of it, I already mentioned data analytics and processing. It's the same infrastructure, be it BigQuery, et cetera, which we have invested and built over time. And people are looking to use data analytics alongside with machine learning and AI. They want to do this across structure and unstructured data, do it across any platform. And so that's the kind of capability we are able to bring. And overall, I'll let Ruth comment on maybe the margin side of this a bit more. Ruth? Ruth Porat : Yeah. I would just build on Sundar's comment. There's really no change in our approach to building the Cloud business. We do intend to continue to invest meaningfully. We are very pleased with the business, as we both said. As an example, we're continuing to build out the global footprint, continuing to invest in our compute capacity globally. As an example, we most recently announced a second cloud region in India. This is our 26th cloud data center region globally. And so continuing to invest across the board, given the opportunity that we see. And as I said last quarter, I would not extrapolate from quarter-to-quarter, given we still are in the early stages of building the business, and we do intend to continue to invest aggressively, including expanding our go to market organization, our channel expansion, our product offerings and our compute capacity. Excited about what we're seeing the team executing upon here. Sundar Pichai : On Search, to answer the first part of your... Philipp Schindler : Yeah, can you hear me? Sundar Pichai : Yeah. Philipp Schindler : Yeah. And to the first part of the question, similar to what I said in my remarks at the beginning, retail was again, by far the largest contributor to the year-on-year growth of our ads business. Travel, financial services, media entertainment were also very, very strong contributors. Justin Post : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is open. Colin Sebastian : Thanks for taking my questions. First, Sundar, as a follow-up on Cloud, you talked about the tailwinds from advanced AI and data analytics in terms of growth. Is it fair to say as well based on your initial comments that security also represents some competitive differentiation that's contributing incrementally to business development? And then for Philipp, in the momentum in YouTube and capturing the shift in viewership and advertising away from linear TV, how do the different Google Services fit together in that? Not just core YouTube, but Android TV, Google TV, YouTube TV. Is this something that's been increasingly connected or linked in the back end and as well on the front end for consumers? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : On security and cloud, we definitely see it as a strong differentiation. Obviously, Google for a long time. We are cloud native. We pioneered approaches like Zero Trust, built the architecture out from a security first perspective. And so particularly over the course of the last couple of years, as companies have really - with the recent attacks, they really started thinking deeply about the vulnerabilities, supply chain security has been a major source of consensus, particularly over the past few quarters. Cyber threats, increasingly, is in the mind of not just CIOs, but CEOs across our partners. And so it's definitely an area where we are seeing a lot of conversations, a lot of interest. It's our strongest product portfolio, and we are continuing to enhance our solutions, be it integrating Chronicle, BeyondCorp and all the product components we have there. So a definite source of strength and you'll continue to see us invest here. Philipp Schindler : And on the second part of your question, look, momentum is really strong across both our brand and direct response business on YouTube. Maybe let me start on the brand side. The global shift to online video and streaming continues, with over like 2 billion monthly active users now, 1 billion plus hours of video watched every day. I think we're at the forefront of this shift. And advertisers have increasingly needed to look beyond linear TV alternatives to achieve their reach and awareness goals. And as I said earlier, Nielsen total ad ratings reach reporting has found, on average, 70% of YouTube's reach was delivered to an audience, not reached by the advertisers TV media. So not only are we driving improved reach, but we're also helping brands do it more efficiently. And as a result of this, you see many advertisers re-evaluating the media mix and increasing their investments in our platforms. And as far as the direct response part goes, we're helping advertisers convert intent into action. We try to drive performance at an incredible scale. Take an example like with video action campaigns, which is our next-generation TrueView for Action format. Advertisers are getting access to even more inventory across YouTube and our partners, all in a single automated campaign. And as I said before, we're working really hard to make YouTube not only more actionable, but also more shoppable. So YouTube is proving to be meaningful for not just brand building and reaching a massive audience, but also for converting viewers into buyers. And what's nice is that we're seeing more advertisers leveraging brand to create demand and direct response to convert it. So they're basically using the funnel very, very smartly. And then to the second part of your second question, the YouTube TV ads, for example. This part, we're really trying to bring the - well, connected TV is - let me phrase it from a connected TV part. I think that's easier. It is really the fastest growing consumer service that we have. And that growth started before the pandemic and has frankly solidified since. And in the US, we have over 120 million people watch YouTube on TVs every month, and that's up from like 100 million last year. We're number one in reach and watch time among ad-supported streaming services. So we're very, very happy with the development that we're seeing here. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thanks. Just a follow-up on YouTube. Can you maybe talk to the e-commerce opportunity that you're seeing evolve? Where you're at now, and eventually, where would you like to be? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On YouTube, look, I mean, if you look at the engagement across the platform, we definitely see a lot of headroom for e-commerce. Over the past year, you've seen us really focus on ads rating a shift to - in terms of onboarding merchants across Google. So we have definitely invested both in terms of bringing merchants on board, removing barriers there, providing better integrations by partnering with players, platform providers across the industry. And now we are investing in our consumer experiences, be it on Google Search or on YouTube. And so you will see us roll out features over time. Philipp, do you want to add more here? Philipp Schindler : Yeah. Look, there's a ton of commercial intent across YouTube, and it was a shopping destination before COVID. I mean, think un-boxing videos, product reviews, make up tutorials and so on. And throughout the pandemic, we've really seen more shoppers turn to the platform for ideas, inspiration and really help them decide what to buy. And a number of shopping capabilities' already underway, and we're working really hard to make it easier for users to discover and buy directly on YouTube. And I mentioned how a merchant can globally add their product feeds now right into video action campaigns, and brands and shoppers alike are loving it, and we've also done beta testing this, for example, with Discovery Ads. And last quarter, I mentioned how viewers can make purchases from their favorite creators via early experiments with brand connect and shop with product shelves, and early adopters are seeing a lot of success here. So stay tuned for more updates later this year. Brent Thill : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. We've had record new business formation in the US, and I think globally in the wake of COVID. And my guess is that, that's also been a major driver of growth for you. Could you just talk about that a little bit to the extent to which you think some of these, especially the advertising trends, come from these new businesses that are formed, whether they're digital hybrid or whatever? And then secondly, how do you go from tens of thousands of Waymo rides to millions of rides? Like what are the biggest obstacles to that? Any clue at all as to how long that takes, are the issues more regulatory, more technical? Thank you. Philipp Schindler : Look, new businesses, small businesses are the backbone of our economy here. But obviously, local communities are in varying stages of recovery. Some are reopening, while others are, unfortunately, returning to lockdown. And we're focused on continuing to, I would say, level the playing field for SMBs here. And from getting them online and, frankly, set up for success, you're giving them all the digital tools they need to get discovered and be ready for what's ahead. This includes the ability to like seamlessly transition between online and offline and reach customers nearby, far beyond their local neighborhoods as well. So over the past few months, I mean, literally, just the past few months, we've made it easier for SMBs to show their products across Google for free, and we added new ways for them to highlight in-store inventory through local inventory ads. And we've also made it easier for them to leverage the power of YouTube. They now can create video ad campaigns literally within minutes via their smartphone. And these are just a few examples of the ways we're helping. Plus, also interesting trend, people are more eager than ever to support their local small businesses. Searches for support local business are up like 20x last year in the US alone. And this is creating a lot of opportunity for SMBs overall. And I don't know, take an example, like Ayla Beauty  for example, it's a San Francisco beauty brand. They made 100% pivot to online during the pandemic. And with insight into popular wellness and beauty searches and Google Ads, has been really able to grow their business significantly over the last year. Sundar Pichai : On Waymo, as you mentioned, in our - in Phoenix, we've had very good experience by scaling up rides. These are driverless rides and no one else in the car other than the passengers, and people have had a very positive experience overall. We are obviously with a strong focus on safety. We're looking to scale it up. Through it all, we are building newer capabilities as well investing in next-generation of hardware and software. So it's an iterative process, and at each step, it's very clear to us that we are ahead, and we are making progress, and you'll see us continue to invest here, with a focus on safety first, and I expect this to scale up more through the course of 2022. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Sundar. Thank you, Philipp. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Michael Nathanson : Great, thanks. I have one for you, Sundar, and one for Philipp. Just a minute ago, Philipp spoke to the acceleration in streaming and smart TVs worldwide and the importance that YouTube has on the TV glass. I wanted to hear from you about your interest in supporting the smart TV ecosystem? And where do you see the opportunity for Google in terms of your product offerings to maybe improve consumer adoption of connected TVs? And then for you, Philipp, people have been asking about Search. But if you look at Search on a 2 year stack, the growth is the highest it has been years. And I wonder if you can disaggregate for us the growth between maybe new sort customers coming on the platform versus increased spending on an existing per customer basis? Anything you help us on kind of what drove it on a client-by-client basis on Search? Sundar Pichai : You know, on the first question on the smart TV ecosystem. Look, I mean, there is a shift to these becoming computing devices over time. They are going to be connected computing experiences. People who both consume content passively, actively, including gaming, over the top video and so on. So we view this as part of our platform shift. Android TV has made tremendous strides. It's a very customizable platform. We are working not only with TV providers globally, we are doing it with cable box manufacturers, as well as we supplement it with Google TV, with Chromecast as well. So it's a significant investment from our side, making sure we can drive that shift. And obviously, it has a lot of synergies for us in terms of being able to bring our services to our users, as well as give more opportunities for our Play developers to reach more users as well. But definite strong integration points with YouTube and YouTube TV as well. Philipp Schindler : Look, maybe rather than go into the deep dis-aggregation that you're talking about. Let me maybe talk a little about how we think about the overall market for Search. In the addressable market, in the last call - last quarter, I gave you a little bit of a breakdown here. But what is really important is we're not just addressing above the line marketing budgets, which is different metrics around, let's say, around $0.5 trillion  which is traditional advertising, TV advertising and so on. There is also significant upside in below the line budgets overall, like promotional pricing, product within sponsorships and so on. And sure, we've seen COVID accelerate the shift to e-commerce at an astounding rate, but keep also in mind, 80% of commerce still remains offline. So there's a lot of room for digital to play a bigger role, and we think we can tap into other budgets that were traditionally used for, let's say, local advertising to drive sales. And as we think about our long runway for growth, we also think obviously about improving user and advertiser experiences for years to come here. And we're constantly asking ourselves how do we drive better answers to queries, including those with commercial intent. And how do we use our ML to deliver even more relevant and higher quality experiences for users. And our primary focus is really on delivering great experience for users and driving incremental value for our partners and making them successful. And I think as long as we do this, we should continue to see budgets move our way. Michael Nathanson : Okay. Thank you, both. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is open. Jason Bazinet : Thanks. I just had one question, maybe it dovetails off of what you just said. But if I take your ad dollars this quarter, $50 billion in annualized, it's like $200 billion a year. Are you or the Board focused at all on trying to diversify away from the ad market? Or do you just feel like there's so much runway that there is no real reason to stay focused on non ad-based growth? Sundar Pichai : Look, at a high level, we - multiple parts to your question. Obviously, we are very focused on - we have a mission. We have an approach of being helpful across certain important attributes. And we do deep investments in computer science and AI to build services. And out of that, naturally, there is diversification over time. When you look at YouTube, is contributing to that. You look at Cloud, and within Cloud, we have both GCP and Workspace contributing to that. And longer term, we have efforts like Waymo as well. Beyond that, as both Philipp and Ruth have spoken about, with this digital shift, we see a lot of headroom in terms of where market for either advertising or e-commerce, and so we see a lot of headroom there as well. So we take a long-term view. We start from first principles to its focusing on both investing in deep technology and solving user problems. And out of that, I think you have a set of diversified models that emerged, both different types of businesses. And also within a business, for example, in YouTube, we have both ads and subscription over time. And so I think we'll continue approaching it that way with an eye for the long term. Jason Bazinet : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks. Jim Friedland : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2021 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  I'd now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jim Friedland : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Ruth Porat. Now, I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business operations and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking. And such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. During this call, we'll present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at ABC investor. And now, I will turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Jim. And good afternoon, everyone. In 2016, I laid out our vision to become an AI first Company. Five years later, this quarter's results show how our investments in AI are building more healthful products for people and for our partners in local communities. Today, I'll begin with new product highlights. Then I'll cover our cloud business, followed by YouTube. First product highlights. Search remains the heart of what we do. We have made remarkable advances over the past 23 years that benefit search and related products like Google Assistant. We have just celebrated five years. Earlier this year, we announced that we reached a significant milestone with Multitask Unified Model, or MUM for short. MUM is a thousand times more powerful than BERT and can understand information across many contexts, like text and images.  On our search event in September, we shared how we are using MUM theme through Google Lens, so people can search using both images and words. We also shared that we are bringing a more visual shopping experience to search, powered by Google Shopping graph. It linked shoppers with over 24 billion product listings from merchants across the graph. Google Maps now offers eco -friendly routing. It lets drivers in the U.S. to some more fuel-efficient route, saving money and reducing emissions. Maps now has a wildfire layer so that people can get up today details and make quick, informed decisions during emergencies.  Finally, in search and us discover feed, we're continuing to support the news eco system and make quality journalism more accessible. Philipp will give a bit more detail about our new showcase partnerships. Turning next to hardware, I hope you saw our fall P pixel event last week.  I am very excited about the range of Pixel phones available this holiday season. The new Pixel 6 and 6 Pro brings together the best of Google AI, software and hardware at the most advanced and inclusive cameras we've ever.  They are beautiful, fast, and powered by Google Tensor, a first-ever system-on-a-chip. It's specifically built to support Google AI and machine learning on device, and provide s a long-term foundation for our Pixel devices. We also introduced our new Nest for a  program, which uses Nest Thermostats to support clean energy use in the home.  On to Android, Android 12 is getting great reviews. It's the biggest design change in Android's history with new widgets to personalize your phone. We also introduced accessibility features that use gestures to control your phone and communicate. Android 12 is secured by default and private by design. New dashboards and the indicators make it easier to view and adjust privacy permissions and disable access to device sensors and location information. We've also made progress with the made for India affordable smartphone co-developed with Reliance.  The Geophone next device features premium localized capabilities and is on track to launch in-market by Diwali. Onto cloud, where we see continued momentum with Q3 revenue growing 45% year-over-year with GCP's revenue growth rate about Cloud overall. At Cloud next two weeks ago, we unveiled 100s of new capabilities, services, and solutions.  We also announced 20 new and expanded partnerships to support the growth and scale of our customers around the world. More than any other top cloud provider. Google Cloud has unique capabilities to meet the needs of enterprises, digital natives, and SMB around the world. I'll highlight three. First, our leadership in real time data, analytics in AI, is winning customers like Carrefour Belgium,  Post, DHL, and Wendy's, who are unlocking data to deliver unique business outcomes. Big Query, our leading data warehouse solution is reducing costs and driving productivity at Cardinal Health and ATB Financial. Our differentiated AI in mall-based industry solutions are helping leading global companies.  GE Appliances, a higher Company is integrating Vision AI into their next-generation smart home appliances. And Ikea Retail is using recommendation AI to drive a 30% increase in customer click-through rate. Second, customers see value in our open scalable infrastructure that enables them to run workloads anywhere on our cloud, at the edge, or in their datacenters.  Rodan + Fields scale, it's says SAP environment, Siemens Energy migrating its global network of datacenters and Company-wide SAP systems. And Indonesia's largest technology, digital native, go-to group is supporting over a 100 million monthly active users with Google Cloud.  General Mills, Bell Canada, and Wells Fargo are harnessing our leadership in multi-cloud and our open development environment. And to meet the unique digital sovereignty needs of customers around the world, we announced industry first partnerships with T-Systems in Germany and Palace in France. Third, as consumers, businesses, and schools continue to shift towards hybrid work, the threats of cyber security continue to increase. Customers are turning to Google Workspace and our cyber security platform to provide the ease of use, collaboration, and security they need.  These include organizations like Discovery, Common Spirit Health, and the state of Maryland who want to foster creativity while securely protecting their users. We're also seeing strong growth in our broad portfolio of cyber security products.  This includes Chronicle, one of our zero-trust offerings, with JetBlue users to detect cyber security threats, helping to protect its customers and enterprise. We're bringing our team's deep expertise to customers through the Google Cyber Security action team and a new Work Safer program, which provides best-in-class security for emails, meetings, messaging, and more.  Earlier, I mentioned a few of the sustainability-related product features we announced. Our Cloud customers already benefit from operating on the world's cleanest cloud and last year we set an ambitious goal to run our data centers and campuses on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.  Two - thirds of the electricity consumed by Google data centers in 2020 was matched with local carbon-free sources on an hourly basis. And our new carbon footprint tool gives customers carbon emissions insights associated with their Google Cloud Platform usage. Now over to YouTube for a few highlights. We recently surpassed 50 million music and premium subscribers, including those in trial. And YouTube shots continues to see higher option rates. In the past year, the average number of daily first-time creators more than doubled. Next week as global leaders gather in Glasgow to address climate change, YouTube is partnering with COP26 to livestream conference activities, making the event more accessible for everyone. As we grow, we are maintaining our open global platform responsibly by removing harmful content and reducing bottom-line content. Both our AI investments and the promotion of Clustered sources have helped us significantly lower the violated view rate, which is the percentage of views on YouTube from content that violates our policies. Onto our other bets.  Waymo began welcoming riders to its trusted tester program in San Francisco in addition to its fully autonomous ride-hailing service currently in Phoenix. Next year, Waymo will open a dedicated trucking hub in the Dallas Fort Worth area, helping support commercial freight droughts across the Southwest. And we announced last week the first commercial expansion of things on demand, air delivery service to Walgreens customers in select locations. To close, the world is slowly starting to travel and meet up in-person. In this quarter, I joined events virtually to celebrate some big milestones in regions around the world. Earlier this month, we announced a $1 billion investment in Africa over five-years to support the continent's digital transformation.  And September mark 20 years since we opened our first office outside of the U.S. in Tokyo. We now have thousands of employees in 28 offices across the Asia Pacific region. And we are investing in cloud regions and digital skills programs to help expand economic opportunity there.  As you can see, our business in APAC is growing really well. in Africa, Asia Pacific and beyond it's been a successful quarter and we have lots more innovation and product development on the way. Thanks to our employees around the world for their contributions. As we continue our  to hybrid work, I hope to see more of you in person soon. Thank you and over to Philipp. Philipp Schindler : Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. It's great to be with you all today. We are pleased with the growth in Google Services revenues in the third quarter. Year-on-year performance was driven by broad-based strength and advertisers spend. Consumer online activity also remained elevated. In the third quarter, Retail was, again, by far the largest contributor to year-on-year of our Apps business.  Media and entertainment, finance, and travel were also strong contributors. Let's take a deeper look at some of the trends that drove this quarter's performance. First, from a big picture global recovery perspective, we continue to see a lot of unevenness. Some economies have restarted and re-accelerated or be at different speeds.  Other countries, depending on local regulations and vaccines, have been slower to rebound. It's clear that uncertainty is the new normal. The world is in flux. So, when it comes to anticipating change, predicting demand, and investing in innovation, businesses need as much support now as they did a year-and-a-half ago.  And we continue to help, like in travel, where hotel free booking links are increasing traffic for many partners from OTAs to boutique hotels. Consumers like more choice. Travel partners like free exposure. Jim Friedland : And advertisers like to augment paid campaigns with free listings. So last month we launched free  for things to do, and a new ad format that makes it easier to promote local experiences.  Now, when you search zip lining, aquariums, or the Tokyo Tower, you can buy tickets directly on Google. And then there are companies like Alaska Airlines that are harnessing first-party data and automation across search to navigate market fluidity and better understand the lifetime value of their customers.  They have increased return on ad spend by 30% plus versus the same period pre COVID, beyond travel. Business of all kinds are increasingly adopting tools like AI driven automation and insights to connect with customers. No matter what stage of the recovery there in. 150-year-old luxury retailer Philipp Schindler : De Bijenkorf turned to local insights and automation to speed up cross-border expansion beyond the Netherlands and Belgium to Germany, France, and Austria. With a multi-pronged approach, including Shopping campaigns, de Bijenkorf drove substantial growth throughout the pandemic.  Returning visitors to online stores, were up fourfold in first half 2021 versus 2020, which leads me to Retail, where we had another stellar quarter. We've seen explosive growth in Digital over the last 27 months. But as the world begins to reopen, shoppers are returning to stores. Brick and mortar aren\u2019t dead. Instead, omni -channel is in full force.  Searches for open now near me are four times globally versus last year. Strong growth in Local Shopping queries means people are researching the visits to stores more often before they go. As a result, we've seen more advertisers include in-store sales alongside e-commerce goals to drive omni -channel growth. Adoption has nearly doubled over the past year.  Take COTS, it optimizes media spend into trending categories and launched curbside pickup just two weeks after its 1100 stores shutdown. After testing local inventory ads in Q4, COTS went all-in on omni -channel bidding across its paid search portfolio and is leaning heavily into a full funnel approach on YouTube, including CTV. COTS (ph.) net sales were up 31% year-over-year in Q2, led by higher foot traffic and continued strength in digital.  Innovating an omni -channel and next-gen user experiences remains core to our Shopping strategy. A few of our latest launches include easier ways for business to show the local services they offer, from hair extensions to auto repair, across Search and Maps.  Local inventory ads, it highlights which products are in stock and when to pick them up. Free shipping and easy return annotations across search and Shopping, AI capabilities that bring in-store moments online and that users try before they buy, and then instantly shoppable images with Google Lens, plus a new visual, browsable experience on Search. There's a lot more to come, including tapping into commerce on YouTube. from shoppable livestream experiments with retailers like, Sephora, Target and Walmart. To pilots that, that viewers by directly from the favorite creators\u2019 videos we're still in the early innings of what\u2019s possible.  Our direct response momentum remains strong, video action campaigns are driving more conversions than previous formats, and by adding product feeds to these campaigns, advertisers are achieving on average, over 60% more conversions at a lower cost than those without. Our brand business is also performing well. As I said last quarter, YouTube's reach is becoming increasingly incremental to TV. We're helping advertisers find audiences they can't find anywhere else. Connected TV is driving part of this growth, is our fastest-growing screen. The precision of digital paired with the scale of linear is proving to be an awesome combo.  And even more so now with the expansion of video action campaigns for CTV. Advertisers can now drive conversions on the big screen, which brings me to help brands of all sizes continue to buy YouTube at both ends of the funnel to create future demand while they convert existing demand. And they're seeing upside.  For example, we found that advertisers using both DR And brand video see brands driving 28% of conversion assists. Domino's Pizza is a great example. the UK business delivered a 9x return on ad spend on their direct response campaigns when paired with our brand campaigns. Lastly, I've said it before, and I'll say it again : our success is only possible because of our customers and partners.  We do well only when they do well. And it's a result of the revenue share models we've talked about many times before. Three highlights, first, as Sundar mentioned, our commitment to high-quality journalism and open access to information remains steadfast. It's been one year since we launched new showcase. In Q3 alone, we signed over 120 deals and launched in three new markets, Japan, Colombia, and Austria. And of the more than 1,000 publications across a dozen-plus countries that we now have on board, 90% are considered local, regional, or community newspapers.  Second, over 2 million creators are now making money and building their businesses on YouTube via YouTube Partner Program with 10 different ways to monetize their content from Super Chat to Brand Connect. The next-generation of businesses and media companies are being built by creators on YouTube and we're excited to help them grow. Third by echoes Sundar's excitement on Pixel, and to bring it to life and to users, we worked with an entire ecosystem of partners. We signed partnership agreements with over 45 carriers and retailers across 9 countries at launch, including deep collaboration, with each of the major U.S. carriers AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon. On behalf of many. I want to say how grateful we are to collaborate with so many amazing customers and partners every day.  We can't wait to start doing more of this in person again soon. Also, a huge thank you to our sales partnerships, product and support teams for their work and dedication. The impact you all continue to have is, as we say in Germany, , with that Ruth over to you. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Philipp. Our revenue performance in the third quarter reflects continued broad-based strength in advertisers spend and elevated consumer online activity, as well as a strong contribution from Google Cloud.  My comments will be on a year-over-year comparison for the third quarter unless I state otherwise. We will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook. For the third quarter, our consolidated revenues were 65.1 billion, up 41% or up 39% in constant currency.  Our total cost of revenues was 27.6 billion, up 31% primarily driven by growth in TAC, which was 11.5 billion up 41%. Other cost of revenues was 16.1 billion, up 24%, reflecting in part the benefit from the change in useful lives meet earlier this year.  The largest driver of the growth in other cost of revenues was content acquisition costs. Operating expenses were 16.5 billion, up 19%, in terms of the 3 component parts of opex. First, the increase in R&D expenses was driven primarily by headcount growth.  Second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses was driven by headcount growth, followed by the continued ramp up of spending on ads and promo, in contrast to the pullback in the third quarter last year. Finally, the increase in G&A reflects the impact of charges relating to legal matters, followed by headcount growth.  Operating income was 21 billion, up 88%, and our operating margin was 32%. Other income and expense were 2 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was 18.9 billion. We continue to generate strong free cash flow of 18.7 billion in the quarter and 65.7 billion for the trailing 12 months.  We ended the third quarter with 142 billion in cash and marketable securities. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were 59.9 billion, up 41%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of 37.9 billion in the quarter were up 44% with broad-based strength across our business, led again by strong growth in retail.  YouTube advertising revenues of 7.2 billion, were up 43% due to strength in both direct response and brand advertising. The deceleration in the growth rate versus the second quarter was driven by lapping a strong recovery in brand in the third quarter of last year. Network advertising revenues of 8 billion were up 40%. Other revenues were 6.8 billion up 23% driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues and hardware which benefited from the addition of Fitbit revenues. Google Services operating income was 24 billion, up 66%, and the operating margin was 40%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were 5 billion for the third quarter, up 45%.  GCP's revenue growth was again above Cloud overall, reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by robust growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of 644 million.  As to our other bets in the third quarter, revenues were 182 million, the operating loss was 1.3 billion. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. With respect to foreign exchange impact on reported revenues, based on current spot rates, we expect virtually no impact in Q4, in contrast to 1.5% tailwind in Q3 and 4% in Q2. In terms of outlook by segment. For Google Services, as I noted, the strength of our revenues in Q3 reflected both underlying strength in advertiser and user activity, as well as the impact from lapping weaker performance in the comparable period last year.  Given the gradual recovery in results through the back half of 2020, the benefit from lapping prior year performance diminished in Q3 versus Q2 and will diminish further in Q4. Within other revenues in the fourth quarter, we expect the ongoing drivers of revenue growth to the Hardware due to the benefit from the holiday selling season and inclusion of Fitbit, as well as YouTube subscriptions.  Google Play's contribution to revenue growth will remain more muted given the ongoing impact of both lapping the increased level of user engagement that started in the first quarter of 2020 due to the pandemic, as well as the fee change that took effect on July 1. Within Google Services, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be elevated in the fourth quarter to support the holiday season. Turning to Google Cloud, we remain focused on revenue growth and are pleased with the trends we're seeing. In GCP, our customer wins, as Sundar noted, reflect our multi-year investments in products and solutions that are purpose-built to solve for the biggest opportunities within our targeted 8 industries.  The benefit of these solutions to our customers is clear, and they are choosing to work with us as their long-term transformation partner. With respect to workspace, we are pleased with the ongoing momentum in both seat growth and average revenue per seat, which underscores the value of collaborative solutions, in particular, as people increasingly are embracing a hybrid work model.  Across cloud, we continue to invest aggressively, both in growing our go-to-market and product teams, as well as building out our cloud regions. At the Alphabet level, headcount grew by nearly 6,000 in the third quarter, including our seasonal campus hires.  And we expect robust headcount growth in Q4 for both Google Services and Google Cloud. Turning to CAPEX, the results in the third quarter primarily reflect ongoing investment in our technical infrastructure, most notably in servers to support ongoing growth in Google Services and Google Cloud.  We also continue to increase the pace of investment in fit-outs and ground-up construction of office facilities to accommodate our ongoing headcount growth globally. We will continue to pursue real estate acquisition opportunities where it makes sense, as you saw in our New York City announcement in Q3. Thank you. And now, Sundar, Philipp, and I will take your questions. Operator : Thank you.  And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan : Thank you very much for taking the questions. Maybe first one for Sundar, a big picture. Coming back to how you started the call, when you look out over the next three to five years, what do you see are some of the big investments that Google needs to make to marry your ambitions on AI, machine learning against aligning Google's broader product and services against the rising digitalization of the global economy. Would love to have that as a framing over the next three to five years.  And then maybe -- I am not sure if directed better at Philipp or Ruth, but on a shorter duration basis, it seems to be an element of headwinds and tailwinds in the broader, can you talk a little bit about the business elements of Google's products and what elements of reopening dynamic you're seeing on a sector basis versus potential headwinds as we move into Q4 and next year from things like supply chain shortages, or labor shortages, or things like that. Thanks so much in advance for the color. Sundar Pichai : Eric. Great question. You're right in the fact that AI and ML itself is broader, deeper investments we are driving, and we're using it across our product portfolio. The recent launch of Tensor in Pixel six a great example of that. So, for example, we're willing to go as steep in the stack as needed. Silicon both on the cloud side with our Tensor Processing Units and Google Tensor on the client side is an example of that. Overall, thinking through computer, networking, building data centers, making sure they are clean and carbon-free, and really investing in the advanced models and algorithms on top, which is a lot of it just done by our AI research teams.  So, making sure we're able to attract the best talent across the world is all part of that. So, but you you'll continue to me to see us undertake deep technology investments and beyond the horizon. That's why we're thinking even about areas like quantum computing and so on. Philipp Schindler : So, to the second part of your question, we continue to watch countries as vaccination rates climb and local regulations ease. We expect some amount of heterogeneity in recovery depending obviously on location and vaccination rates. But because every region is different, it's hard to make a generalization from the data right now. That said, the consumer shift to digital is real and will continue even as we start seeing people return to stores. Shopping habits have ebbed and flowed over the last 20 months. But the underlying takeaway is that people want more choice. They want more information, more flexibility, and we don't see this reversing. Omni -channel, I talked about it, is definitely in full force. I said this earlier. We've been really focused on building features and solutions to help retailers, large and small, succeed here.  And we think this will continue as the world reopens, and shoppers fluctuate between online and in-store based on whatever is really more convenient. YouTube is exciting for many reasons. It's incredible to see lot of content that's valuable for people across so many topics, and we're helping advertisers tap into this.  And whether it's browsing for inspiration, product research or actually making the purchase a billion shopping sessions happen across Google every day, and they are happening on search, in YouTube, in image search, in the shopping tab, on Lens, and so on. So frankly, we are really encouraged by the long-term opportunity in commerce, and we are laser focused on helping business of all sizes connect with their customers Sundar Pichai : wherever they are. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brenda Ell : Hi. It's Brenda on for Brian. Thanks for taking our questions. We have two. The first one, you've made notable strides in the retail search category over the past 12 to 18 months, and there seems to be more to come. Can you talk to us about which other search verticals, where you are most excited to innovate and invest around the Nest, within the next year or two? My second question is, maybe one on augmented reality. You have made some real progress here and I have some budding product integrations. Philosophically, how do you think about the key augmented reality use cases you are focused on enabling? And do you need an Alphabet specific hardware set to capitalize on the opportunities? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : I'll take the second one first. On augmented reality, we've -- for a while, we've deeply focused on thinking through computing for the long-term. We've talked about ambient computing, and it's just a matter of time before beyond phones, you will see other successful form factors and AI is an exciting part of that future. We are looking at all deep investments, we need to make. I think it's going to take some time.  And so, for example, when you look at something like Google Lens or when you look at the fact that we are making search work in a multimodal way, or when you think about YouTube and making sure it works well. We are AI world so we are, obviously, investing in all our services.  And beyond that from a computing standpoint, both our hardware teams as well as our platform teams are thinking through definitely, and it's going to be a major area of investment for us. On the first question, I think Philipp spoke about Shopping via, obviously, searches -- part of what makes S search so successful is people use it for a wide variety of use cases.  And so, we really invest comprehensively across all experiences, be it Local and Maps, be it images, be it videos. And so, we're definitely investing a lot. People do come to search for education as well, so making sure we're comprehensive.  Health has been a major area of focus, particularly through the pandemic. And so, the strength of searches both in its depth and breadth and so, and then getting it tried with high focus on quality and will continue to do that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. I've two. First, was just curious if you're seeing any impact at all from the Apple iOS changes in your business and perhaps particularly in YouTube. And then second, given Retail, the biggest driver of services growth, and of course, you are really just touching all parts of the economy, any more commentary on how you're thinking about supply and labor shortage dynamics in the fourth quarter, and if you're perhaps seeing anything thus far there? Thank you. Ruth Porat : Thanks for the question. Starting with the iOS 14 changes. So overall, as we said, we're pleased with the strength across our business in the third quarter, it was broad-based, it was global. In terms of the iOS 14 changes, specifically, they had a modest impact on YouTube revenues, that was primarily in direct response. I think as you all know well, focusing on privacy has been core to what we've been doing consistently. Let me have Phil take you through some more on that. Philipp Schindler : So, from our standpoint, we see ATT (ph.) is one aspect of the many broader ecosystem changes that are on the way, and we've been investing in privacy preserving technology for many years. Our focus is on supporting developers, small and large advertisers, creators\u2019 publishers, so that they're able to mitigate impact to their businesses.  And we really see the future of digital advertising being built on advances and privacy preserving on device technologies which support the free and open Internet. And obviously, a robust ads ecosystem on your supply chain questions. I would say performance in Q3 was strong across revenue lines, regions, and nearly all verticals.  In line with the widespread reporting of supply chain weakness in the audit industry, we've seen some impact on vehicles within the auto vertical which started earlier in the year, although the impact has really been offset somewhat by increased demand in related areas like parts, accessories, repairs, and maintenance. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Q - Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Thank you. One for Sundar, one for Ruth. Sundar, margins have been strong this year and I think the depreciation change has helped. Can you just comment on how you see the current investing spending levels of the Company? Are you in good shape? Anything where you might be increasing investment.  And then for Ruth, there are news about Play Store fee cuts on the subscription piece. How do we think about that maybe impacting the business in '22 when those start to take effect? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Now, at a high level -- look, i mean, I have taken a long-term view, and we're obviously investing both in foundational technologies, like AI and just deeper computer science. So, we're all in in applying it across the prioritize set of areas. And so, no change in the framework, if anything.  I do feel with the digital transformation underway, if anything, we feel a sense of urgency to execute against opportunities we see. So still working within the long-term framework, maybe. Ruth and Philipp? Ruth Porat : Yeah. if I can just add on the margin and go to your second part of the question, just a bit of context on the third quarter here. An important point, hopefully self-evident, is that the improvement in the Q3 operating margin does reflect the strong revenue growth in the quarter.  And as I said on the second quarter call, some of our costs are less variable in the short-term, such as depreciation and the operations costs of our data centers. And we did have a gross margin benefit from this in the near term, but consistent with centers comments  we do continue to invest here. And then to support long-term growth across both Google S services and Google Cloud, we're continuing to invest at a meaningful clip across headcount, compute sales and marketing. I noted that headcount increase in Q3 of about 6,000 and we do expect the pace of hiring to remain strong.  The benefit from the change in useful lives was obviously in the quarter as well and that benefit does diminish is lower in the fourth quarter. So just to put some of that in context, and as Sundar said, we are continuing to invest in the business focusing on long-term growth, with respect to the play changes.  Again, just as it relates to this quarter, and I think as I said, in opening comments, the key point to note there was that results lap the strength that we had going into the pandemic from user engagement, and that continues to seeing user engagement. But yes, there's a reduction in the fee that kicks in, one that we just announced last week, it kicks in as of January 2022, and we'll let you do the modeling on that. Justin Post : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from ISI. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. Two questions. Is there anything that suggest that some of these ATT headwinds for other people in the industry actually cost shifts in budget over to your platforms, your different platforms? And then, as for Philipp and Ruth, just on the margins.  Is there anything other than revenue overage that really strong revenue performance flowing against fixed costs and the extended depreciation schedules that's causing those margins to rise or have you been able to work out, eke out, tweak out new efficiencies in the model itself? Thank you very much. Ruth Porat : So why don't I start on that? The key points, as I said, starts with strong revenue growth and just timing lags. If some of the costs, as I said, are more fixed in the near-term, but we do continue to invest. And you can see that in gross margin. You can see it in operating margin. We are continuing to invest to support growth we see in both Google Services and Google Cloud.  Up leveling the question, we've consistently said, let's look, we our focus on capital allocation is investing for long-term growth and innovation and making sure that we remain focused. on that though, those long-term opportunities. At the same time, we've consistently also said that it's important to ensure that we're being sharp about investments within each product area, and we're continuing to do that.  And we're continuing to focus on investing in what we call operational excellence to ensure we can deliver for all of our stakeholders in a high-quality way. And that includes all of our efforts around privacy, security, and content moderation. So, you're seeing us continue to invest there. A bit of puts and takes. We're trying to ensure that we're setting up all of the areas to deliver for long-term high-quality performance and results. Sundar Pichai : On the first question around ad budgets and shift and stuff, I don't think there's anything notable that we have observed to comment on. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Thanks. On Google Cloud, we continue to hear from the partners that the deal size is building, and Big Query is having a big impact for a lot of your customers. Can you just talk to and expand on what you're seeing there and any other noticeable trends that you're seeing now that maybe you hadn't seen in the past? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks. Look, overall, we continue to see strong momentum. The team is executing well. You mentioned Big Query, Data and Analytics, and AI, continues to be a foundational shift for what companies are trying to completion, and Big Query does stand out there and we're definitely seeing continued momentum, there is a source of strength.  To other areas, I would highlight our Security continues to be an increasing area of focus and a differentiator for us, given over two decades of investment we've had. We've pioneered \"zero trust\" and so on.  So as cybersecurity elevates and consent across companies I talk to and the CEOs, it's definitely been an area. Multi-cloud continues to be a differentiator, I do think customers are increasingly looking for it and we've embraced it from early on so that is an area as well.  But above all, I think we're very, very focused on industry value propositions, so really sharpening our solutions by vertical and that's really helped us get some of the bigger deals you mentioned as well. And we'll continue doing that. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from c. Your line is now open. Michael Nathanson : Thanks. I've had one for Sundar and one for Porat. Sundar, you talked earlier about the Geo-phone next in the launch, next week, in India. I wonder if you can talk about the Walmart turned opportunity for Alphabet India, where you're from opening up that product in any type of time frame when do you think you will see maybe the benefits of what you're doing on the low price on there.  And then it just seems longer-term as more we're targeting becomes more difficult to all these privacy changes. There has to be a mix shift in budgets. I wonder, how do you think the value proposition of search will change going forward and what can you do even more than you've done before to take advantage of what looks like real challenges and the ability to target and measure becomes the mobile search. I mean when it comes to mobile advertising.  Thanks. , thanks for the question. Look, I think, obviously, the pandemic has been hard. But a through it all, people are looking for access, and this definitely being available for people who have adopted smartphones. There is still -- we see the demand for people looking to shift from feature phones to Sundar Pichai : smartphones. And so, part of what excites me about the upcoming partnership with GO in building a phone is really investing beyond just English, and getting languages, and getting the local needs right for people and doing it in a way that many more people can take advantages of a smartphone.  So, I view it as laying the foundation to version of digital transformation and its palpable demand we see and I think over a three to five-year time frame, it will end up having a lot of impact. But overall, India, just like Asia Pacific, continues to be an exciting market for us. We see strength across the categories we are involved in. And so, you'll continue to see us stay focused there.  And to the second part of your question, look, as I said, we see the future of digital advertising being built on advances in privacy-preserving on device technologies. And this is a big area that we've invested already and that we're going to invest in even more. And as far as how we think about our runway for growth, we really think about improving user and advertiser experience for years and years to come. And we're always asking ourselves the same questions, right? How do we drive better answers to queries especially on search, especially including those with commercial intent? How do you use machine learning to deliver even more relevant and higher-quality experiences for users that drive higher clicks and more conversions for advertisers?  So really our main goal is to consistently deliver great experiences for users, drive incremental value for partners, and making them successful. And as long as we do this, and we continue to invest in the privacy-preserving technologies I mentioned, we should continue to see budgets move our way. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is now open. Ross Sandler : Hey guys, I just have a high-level question on YouTube. So, you're obviously doing really well there, and as large as it is and as high as the engagement is compared to just about any other app that we see across the broader Internet, the revenue at just around 30 billion this year pales in comparison to co re Facebook or Instagram. So, do you think this -- this is obviously a huge opportunity for YouTube, especially with connected TV. Is there something that you guys need to change about your approach with either direct sales or kind of decoupling search from YouTube and some of the other products that Google has under the same roof, or do you think continuing along the same path is the right strategy for YouTube specifically? Any color on that would be helpful. Sundar Pichai : Obviously, YouTube is unique in the sense that it's a true video -- native video-first product from day one. And so, you are dealing with new form and obviously as a Company, I think we have taken a long-term view, which is why you see the engagement on the product.  It's working at scale. Content responsibility has been our most important focus for the past many years. And beyond that, I think we worked hard to make sure both creators can do well. It's a great platform for advertisers. We've had strengthened brand.  We built on it. We drove this momentum in direct response. There's obviously in a newer opportunity for just shopping which we are investing in. And  represents an additional early but important area for us from an investment and growth standpoint.  So, I feel the fundamentals of the platform are strong. And with the long-term view, I see this is an area where we have more upside and so we will continue our investments with that in mind. Operator : Thank you, and the next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is now open. Colin Sebastian : A couple of big picture questions. Sundar, first off looking at GCP and some of the innovations you've talked about, like distributed cloud, I just wonder what you think the long-term future is for hybrid cloud environments? Are they really -- or is this really just a part of the process or stepping stones to bring more companies, or most companies over to full cloud adoption? And then secondly, we're seeing a clear blurring of the lines among e-commerce, digital payments, and social platform.  So, I was hoping you could share the vision for Google and YouTube and the other Google apps in this context, how those pieces fit together, the closed loop, shopping platform, if that's the right way to think about it. Thank you. Sundar Pichai : To your first question on GCP, part of our strength is we have taken a very open and scalable and flexible approach, and we don't view it as a one size fits all. So, we want to meet the customers the way they want to take this journey.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].  I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. James Friedland : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat. Now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC including our upcoming Form 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2021. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Jim, and Happy New Year, everyone. The last few months have been challenging for communities everywhere because of Omicron. I'm grateful for the frontline healthcare workers who are helping us through it and glad to see signs that this wave is receding in many parts of the world. Whether it's helping people find a COVID testing center, learn a new skill or launch a new business, our mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it's ever been. In 2022, we'll stay focused on evolving our knowledge and information products, including Search, Maps and YouTube, to be even more helpful. Investments in AI will be key, and we'll continue to make improvements to conversational interfaces like the Assistant. I'll begin by touching on a few highlights from Q4. Our new AI models are helping to create information experiences that are truly conversational, multimodal and personal. For example, Multitask Unified Model, or MUM for short, has improved searches for vaccine information. And soon, we'll introduce new ways to search with images and words simultaneously. In October, we introduced a new AI architecture called Pathways. AI models are typically trained to do only one thing. With Pathways, a single model can be trained to do thousands, even millions of things. From MUM to Pathways to BERT and more, these deep AI investments are helping us lead in Search quality. They're also powering innovations beyond Search. For example, DeepMind's protein folding system AlphaFold was recently recognized by Nature & Science Magazine as a defining breakthrough. To illustrate the scale of the team's achievement, it took scientists more than 50 years to figure out the structure of 150,000 proteins. The DeepMind team has now expanded that number to 1 million, and they think they will get to more than 100 million this year. Philipp will talk in great detail about our advertising business, which also benefits from our investments in AI. It's been a very strong quarter for us. Our teams have helped millions of businesses of all sizes and launched dozens of important features to help them get the most out of their online marketing spend. These businesses are the backbone of our global economy and the heart of our community. So helping them thrive is more important than ever. We are also seeing exciting momentum at YouTube. YouTube Shorts continues to drive significant engagement. We just hit 5 trillion all-time views and have over 15 billion views each day globally. This is helping our creator community reach newer and bigger audiences. In fact, more people are creating content on YouTube than ever before. Last year, the number of YouTube channels that made at least $10,000 in revenue was up more than 40% year-over-year, and we are continuing to improve support for artists and creators. More creatives than ever are earning money from our non-ads products like Super Chat and channel memberships and the Shorts Fund is now available in more than 100 countries. Another big area for investment is combining the best of AI software and hardware to deliver helpful experiences across our family of devices. In Q4, we set an all-time quarterly sales record for Pixel. This came in spite of an extremely challenging supply chain environment. The response to Pixel 6 from our customers and carrier partners was incredibly positive. And AI is making Pixel even more helpful. As one example, Live Translate detects whether a chat message is in a different language and automatically translates it in up to 48 languages. We are also focused on ensuring devices across the Android and Chrome ecosystems work well together. For example, at CES last month, we announced that we are working with Acer, HP and Intel to bring great experiences to their devices. Also announced at CES, the new Ripple open standard will broaden the capabilities of radar technology opening the door for new products and services. Another priority is ensuring our products and services are private, secure and safe. To that end, I'll note a new privacy sandbox proposal called Topics API. We think it will be a big improvement for protecting user privacy while also ensuring businesses are able to thrive online. We'll begin testing this year and look forward to feedback from the industry. Next, on to Cloud. It's been a big year, so let me go a bit deeper this quarter. In Q4, Cloud revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $5.5 billion. Alphabet's backlog increased more than 70% to $51 billion, most of which is attributed to Google Cloud. This growth comes from many leading businesses, including Albertsons and LVMH; digital natives, including Box and Spotify; and public sector agencies, including the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Defense Innovation Unit and the USDA. Our sales force, which we have more than tripled since 2019, delivered strong results across geographies, products and industries, and we continue to invest. For the full year 2021, compared with the full year 2020, we saw over 80% growth in total deal volume for Google Cloud Platform and over 65% growth in the number of deals over $1 billion. Our partner ecosystem is helping accelerate our growth. For the full year 2021 compared with the full year 2020, the number of customers spending more than $1 million through the marketplace increased by 6x. Customer spend through channel partners on GCP more than doubled, and the number of active certifications within our top global systems integrators more than doubled as well. Our product leadership continues with more than 2,000 new cloud products and feature releases in the last year. These were in four categories. First, our data cloud and our AI/ML platform is helping organizations like Cartier, Groupe Rocher and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries understand and use their data intelligently across multiple clouds. Our fast secure data sharing capability helps the National Cancer Institute advance breast cancer research. Our unified data lake and data warehouse, which brings together unstructured and structured data, helps TELUS and Tyson Foods improve their understanding of customers. And our AI/ML platform helps CN deliver better customer experience. Second, our open multi-cloud infrastructure enables customers like BBVA and Wells Fargo to run mission-critical systems on our cloud. We believe new auto scaling in our Kubernetes engine, which allows customers to run 15,000 node clusters, outscales the competition by up to 10 times. Our edge cloud helps us grow in telecommunications, driving partnerships in Q4 with Indosat Oridu Hutchison, Telenor and Verizon. They join existing customers and partners, including Ericsson, Reliance Jio and Nokia. Third, our cybersecurity products are helping product organizations like ANZ Bank, Meditech and Wayfair as a trusted cloud provider. VirusTotal helps product organizations from software supply chain vulnerabilities. Chronicle and Security Command Center help organizations detect and protect themselves from cyber threats. And our fraud prevention and identity verification solutions are protecting over 5 million websites. Finally, our secure communication and collaboration platform, Google Workspace is helping public sector organizations like USAID and the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory as well as global brands, including Colgate and Roche, adopt secure hybrid work. Our new Work Safer program launched in Q4 provides the highest security for e-mail meetings and documents by bringing together Google Workspace, Titan security keys, zero trust and other security advances. Customers come to Google Cloud because of our expertise in bringing enterprises and consumer ecosystems closer together. One example is Shopify. From Black Friday through Cyber Monday, Shopify reported $6.3 billion in global sales by 47 million customers, all safely transacted on Google Cloud. Importantly, we have made progress operating 24/7 on carbon-free energy and continue to provide customers the cleanest cloud in the industry. On to our Other Bets. October marked the one-year anniversary of our Waymo One fully autonomous commercial ride-hailing service in Arizona. In San Francisco, hundreds of riders are using Waymo One as part of our trusted tester program, but many more on the waiting list. And Waymo Via continues delivering freight into the Southwest U.S. and developing partnerships with key industry players. Before I close, I want to say how proud I am of Google\u2019s work to help economic recovery around the world. Nearly a third of small business owners say that without digital tools, they would have had to close their business during the pandemic. Digital skills have also been a lifeline to help people find jobs and grow their carriers. Since 2014, we have provided digital skill training to over 90 million people around the world. In the months and years ahead, technology will help unleash new opportunities globally, especially as hundreds of millions more people come online in places, including Southeast Asia and Africa. With that, let me thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions this quarter and throughout 2021. Over to you, Philipp. Philipp Schindler : Thanks, Sundar. Hi, everyone. It\u2019s great to be here today. We\u2019re pleased with the growth in Google Services revenues in the fourth quarter. Year-on-year performance was driven by broad-based strength in advertiser spend and strong consumer online activity. In the fourth quarter, retail was again by far the largest contributor to year-on-year growth of our ads business. Finance, media and entertainment and travel were also strong contributors. Before we dive into some of the trends that drove this quarter\u2019s performance, let\u2019s zoom out for a second. Quarter after quarter, for the last 20-some months, we said that the world is in flux, that the recovery is uneven, that uncertainty is the new normal. Q4 proved no different. What we know for certain though is that businesses are the lifeblood of a thriving economy, and our role in helping them remains more important than ever. AI continues to power our ability to help via Insights, new tools and automation. In fact, the same cutting-edge AI that\u2019s advancing our understanding of everything from search to protein-folding is also driving innovation across our ads products. Let\u2019s start with automation. It\u2019s become a key differentiator for businesses in navigating complexity and efficiently reaching customers, wherever they are in a privacy-first wave. Our news campaign, Performance Max, went global in November and has been quickly embraced by advertisers. It brings the best of Google Ads, AI and automation together to let brands promote their businesses across all Google services from a single campaign, helping them drive more online sales, leads and/or foot traffic. It\u2019s also an example of how we are radically simplifying our products and making them easier for customers to use. French children\u2019s wear retailer Petit Bateau tested PMax over a three-week period, return on ad spend jumped 35%, click-through rates increased 40%, and valuable insights were gleaned into what messaging resonated most. We\u2019ve also developed our Insights tools. Four new features launched in Q4, including demand forecast, which uses ML to help businesses predict forward-looking trends and better understand what goods to stock and what services to offer when. Whether it\u2019s insights, automation or new features, our work to help businesses more easily connect with their customers has been nonstop. On top of the 100-plus enhancements made to our ads products every quarter, we\u2019ve launched 200-plus features and tools since March 2020. A recent example. We made it easier for businesses to claim and verify their business profile on Google Search and Maps and respond to customer messages directly in search. In Germany, completed business profiles received an average of over 5 times more calls versus those that aren\u2019t. For an SMB, that can be really meaningful. Let\u2019s transition to retail, where we had a terrific quarter. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we\u2019ve seen ongoing shifts in consumer spending patterns. Pre-COVID, each year, we saw increased spikes in demand between Black Friday and Cyber Monday. What\u2019s interesting is that in 2020, and again in 2021, we actually saw shoppers start shopping earlier and spending more throughout the quarter. In Q4, we also saw a parallel lead year-over-year retail query growth with hobbies and leisure close second. I\u2019ve said it before, I\u2019ll say it again, the future of retail is omnichannel. And we continue to invest in new features and next-gen experiences so merchants and shoppers can benefit. Global searches for gift shops near me jumped 60% year-over-year in October, with searches for gifts near me up 70% in Google Maps. People increasingly want to know what\u2019s available nearby before they get to the store. Our new in-stock filter helps with just that. Shoppers can find local stores that carry the products they want right from search, like a new tennis racket or that last-minute birthday gift. Showing in-store availability helps businesses attract local customers, and they\u2019ve caught on. One in four local offers across shopping and Google.com are taking advantage of our curbside pickup badge. People also want deals. They\u2019re looking for value. For shoppers, we made it possible to browse and discover the hottest deals for major moments like Black Friday and Cyber Monday on Search. For merchants, we made it even easier to list promotions via automated imports from third-party integrations like Shopify and WooCommerce. Moving inventory, attracting new customers and building brand loyalty during the holidays and beyond got a lot easier. In Q4, the number of merchants using promo features jumped 280% year-over-year. Retailers are also turning to us to help them transform and accelerate growth. Take Warby Parker, who drove a 32% year-over-year increase in its Q3 sales by not only opening stores and expanding its contact lens business, but also by tapping into Google across surfaces. Omnichannel bidding, smart shopping campaigns and an expanded presence in Maps to promote in-store eye exams contributed to Warby\u2019s success and it since launched its first-ever brand awareness campaign on YouTube, which brings me to YouTube, where our commerce opportunity remains really exciting. We\u2019re making it easier for viewers to buy what they see and simpler for advertisers to drive action with innovative solutions like product feeds and video action campaigns and emerging formats like live commerce. Backcountry.com generated a 12 :1 return on ad spend with product feeds in 2021 and plans to double its investment in 2022, while Samsung, Walmart and Verizon partnered with creators to host shoppable holiday livestream events in the U.S. As for our brand business, momentum remains strong. We continue to make inroads in unlocking TV brand budgets, and we\u2019re still in the early innings of what\u2019s possible with Connected TV.  Let\u2019s take a minute to double-click into the full funnel trend I talked about last quarter. YouTube\u2019s ability to drive both massive reach and action is becoming more clear to more advertisers. In a recent study, DR advertisers who added YouTube branding formats not only drove increased reach, but also averaged 9% more conversions. At the same time, we see more brand advertisers adding action, like Nike Korea, which saw higher conversion rates and drove 50% plus incremental reach by adding video action. Another huge focus for us is continuing to deliver for our partners and key ecosystems, all while delighting users. Our expanded partnership with Snap to deliver a first of its kind quick tap to Snap feature is a great example. Our Pixel 4A with 5G or newer pixel phones users can access Snapchat directly from their lock screen, making Pixel the fastest phone to make a snap. And then across our Pixel and AR teams, we\u2019re working with the NBA to create exciting immersive experiences for fans using 3D and AR technology. And the lighting doesn\u2019t stop there. With Adobe, we are collaborating on a multiyear journey to bring Photoshop, Illustrator and its other flagship products to the web, a testament to the web as a first-class platform for creativity and productivity. As we close out another extraordinary and challenging year, I want to express deep gratitude to our customers and partners for their trust and collaboration. Our success is only possible because of their success. I also want to say a gigantic thank you to our product, engineering, partnerships, sales and many support teams for their outstanding work and unwavering commitment to helping our users, customers and partners. Ruth, over to you. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year, which reflected broad-based strength in advertiser spend and strong consumer online activity as well as substantial ongoing revenue growth from Google Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. We will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenues were $75.3 billion, up 32% or up 33% in constant currency, rounding out a strong year. Our total cost of revenues was $33 billion, up 26%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $19.6 billion, up 25%. The biggest factors here were : first, content acquisition costs, primarily driven by costs for YouTube\u2019s advertising-supported content followed by costs for subscription content; second, hardware costs; and third, costs associated with data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which were offset in part by the impact of the change in useful lives made at the beginning of 2021. Operating expenses were $20.5 billion, up 35%. In terms of the three component parts of OpEx : first, the increase in R&D expenses was driven primarily by headcount growth; second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses was driven primarily by increased spending on ads and promo for the 2021 holiday season, in contrast to the sizable pullback in the fourth quarter of 2020; finally, the increase in G&A reflects the impact of charges relating to legal matters as well as charitable contributions. Operating income was $21.9 billion, up 40%, and our operating margin was 29%. Other income and expense was $2.5 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was $20.6 billion. We continue to generate strong free cash flow with $18.6 billion in the quarter and $67 billion in 2021. We ended the year with $140 billion in cash and marketable securities. We also repurchased a total of $50 billion of our shares in 2021. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $69.4 billion, up 31%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $43.3 billion in the quarter were up 36%, with broad-based strength across our business, led again by strong growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.6 billion were up 25%, reflecting strength in both direct response and brand advertising. The deceleration in the growth rate versus the third quarter of 2021 was driven primarily by lapping a strong recovery in brand in the fourth quarter of 2020. Network advertising revenues of $9.3 billion were up 26%, driven by AdMob. Other revenues were $8.2 billion, up 22%, driven primarily by growth in hardware, which benefited from the successful launch of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro as well as the addition of Fitbit revenues followed by YouTube non-advertising revenues. In terms of Google Services cost, TAC was $13.4 billion, up 28%. Google Services operating income was $26 billion, up 36%. And the operating margin was 37%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $5.5 billion for the fourth quarter, up 45%. GCP\u2019s revenue growth was again greater than Clouds, and that reflects significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by solid growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $890 million. As to our Other Bets for the full year 2021, revenues were $753 million. The operating loss was $5.3 billion for the full year 2021 versus an operating loss of $4.5 billion in 2020. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. We are nearly two years into a global pandemic that has brought unprecedented change and uncertainty in the macro environment. Throughout these difficult times, Googlers have remained focused on delivering helpful services for users and partners as well as on driving innovation for long-term growth. In terms of outlook by segment, for Google Services, we are very pleased with our year-on-year revenue growth in Q4 and for the full year 2021, which continued to be driven by broad-based advertiser strength and strong consumer online activity. The year-on-year growth rate also reflected a benefit from lapping COVID-related weakness in 2020, which obviously will not be a factor in 2022. Within other revenues, we are pleased with the momentum from Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro reflected in our hardware revenues in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, hardware revenues in 2021 also reflected the acquisition of Fitbit, which we lapped a couple of weeks ago. With respect to Play, the underlying consumer spend and engagement trends remained healthy in the fourth quarter. That being said, in 2022, Google Play\u2019s contribution to revenue growth will reflect the fee changes we started to implement in the third quarter of 2021. In terms of investment levels within Google Services, we are focused investing meaningfully in the many opportunities we see for growth. Turning to Google Cloud, 2021 represented another year of substantial growth. Our investments in our go-to-market organization, product innovation and partner ecosystem have been paying off as we help customers with their digital transformation. You can see that Google Cloud revenues increased by 47% for the full year 2021 compared to 2020 with GCP revenues continuing to grow at a faster rate than cloud overall. While Cloud operating loss and operating margin improved in 2021, we plan to continue to invest aggressively in Cloud given the sizable market opportunity we see. We do remain focused on the longer-term path to profitability and over time, operating loss and operating margin should benefit from increased scale. At the Alphabet level, in the first quarter, based on current spot rates, we expect the foreign exchange impact on reported revenues to be a headwind. With respect to Alphabet headcount, we added nearly 6,500 people in the fourth quarter, and the majority of hires were for technical roles. We continue to attract great talent and expect a strong pace of hiring in 2022 across Alphabet. Turning to CapEx. The results in the fourth quarter primarily reflect ongoing investment in our technical infrastructure, most notably in servers, to support ongoing growth in both Google Services and Google Cloud. We also increased the pace of investment in fit-outs and ground-up construction of office facilities. In 2022, we expect a meaningful increase in CapEx. In technical infrastructure, servers will again be the largest driver of spend. With respect to office facilities, after fairly muted CapEx over the past two years, we are reaccelerating investment in fit-outs and ground-up construction. Recently, you have also seen us pursue real estate acquisitions where they make sense. For example, last month, we announced plans to purchase for $1 billion of previously leased headquarters building in London. And in the first quarter, we have completed the $2.1 billion purchase of a New York office building that we announced in the third quarter of 2021. Thank you. And now Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Douglas Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, first was just curious to get your view on Web3 and just how you\u2019re thinking about Alphabet\u2019s approach and where your primary efforts here may lie going forward? And then, Ruth, you mentioned the 6,500 increase in head count. I think it was the biggest that we\u2019ve seen in any quarter ever. I know you\u2019re catching up on hiring from the last several quarters. But can you just help us understand little bit more on where these investments are going in tech and how to think about the cost structure in \u201922? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Thanks. Look, any time there is innovation, I find it exciting, and I think it is something we want to support the best we can. The web has always evolved, and it\u2019s going to continue to evolve. And as Google, we have benefited tremendously from open-source technologies, and so we do plan to contribute there. There\u2019s several areas of interest, AR is a big one at the computing layer. We\u2019ve been investing there for a long time and will continue to play a role. And it\u2019s something both not just at the computing layer, the services layer, be it Maps, YouTube, Google Meet, et cetera, I think, will contribute a lot. On Web3, we are definitely looking at blockchain and such an interesting and powerful technology with broad applications, so much broader again in any one application. So as a company, we are looking at how we might contribute to the ecosystem and add value. Just one example, our Cloud team is looking at how they can support our customers\u2019 needs in building, transacting, storing value and deploying new products on blockchain-based platform. So we\u2019ll definitely be watching the space closely and supporting it where we can. Overall, I think technology will continue to evolve and innovate, and we want to be pro-innovation and approach it that way. Ruth Porat : And in terms of headcount, we do continue to be a magnet for great talent. The number of applications is up year-on-year. And as I said, as you noted, we added almost 6,500 people in the fourth quarter. We do expect the strong pace to continue. And it really goes to comments from Sundar, from Philipp and from me. We\u2019re excited about the opportunities ahead of us in particular, Google Services, Google Cloud, we\u2019re adding. We intend to ensure we have the scale that we need to execute well. And so we\u2019re continuing to hire, as I said. The majority were again in technical roles and really pleased with the opportunities we see ahead. Douglas Anmuth : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much. Maybe two questions, if I can. First, following up on Doug\u2019s question. Susan has been writing a fair bit on YouTube and the way it\u2019s exposed to the creator economy and what you\u2019re trying to build for the medium to long-term. Can you talk about elements of the creator economy and how it sort of fits into your products, both on the advertising side and the commerce side over the medium to long-term? And then, Ruth, maybe just one follow-up on the expense side. Was there anything of a one-time nature in Q4? Because just looking at some of the corporate expense or some of the elements of the core margin, just trying to make sure if there were any one-timers that needed to be called out because I think you talked about legal and charitable donations as well just so we could model that right. Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On YouTube, look, one of the -- YouTube from day one, it\u2019s been very focused on making sure we can support creators while it\u2019s been a big part. And even recently, I mentioned in my remarks earlier about the growth we are seeing not just in ads, but beyond ads, with Super Chat, channel memberships and so on. Susan mentioned in her creator letter that -- while early, they\u2019ll be taking a look at NFT and so on, with the view towards making sure the user experience works and -- but there is value, we are constantly thinking about how we can support and do more for creators. So that\u2019s going to be an integral part. I think all the commerce experiences we are thinking about in YouTube is a whole additional layer of opportunity. And again, it\u2019s another area where it all feels very early to me. We are seeing tremendous traction in YouTube across newer areas, be it podcast, gaming, learning, sports. And so across all these areas, we\u2019ll kind of take a vertical-specific look and see how we can support creators better. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of expense, I gave a number of the items. R&D was mostly an increase in headcount. In sales and marketing, I would note that sales and marketing was elevated in the fourth quarter by ads and promo, in part to support the holiday season and more so than last year. The additional items to note that I called out is in the fourth quarter, we did have a one-time well-being bonus. We also had a year-on-year increase in charitable contributions, including a higher Googler gift match. And in fact, I would say that it\u2019s more helpful in particular on the corporate costs unallocated to think of that line on a trailing 12-month basis because it can be lumpy to your question. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Maybe the first one for Philipp. You\u2019ve made so much progress over the last 12 to 24 months about improving the retail and e-commerce Search product for advertisers. As you look across the other verticals of Search, where are you most excited or see the most opportunity for innovation to really drive more value for advertisers in nonretail verticals as we go into 2022? Then the second question, either Philipp or Sundar, you both talked about the commerce shopping opportunity on YouTube. Can you just sort of talk to us a little bit about what aspects are already built out versus what areas of innovation or hurdles you still have to clear to really realize that commerce opportunity on YouTube? Thanks. Philipp Schindler : Yes. Thank you so much for your question. Look, consumers now have a lot of different ways to access information and more than they\u2019ve ever had before. And Search is just one of them. But we\u2019re constantly trying to innovate and improve the experience for both users and advertisers over the long-term. And as I\u2019ve discussed previously, I can share some of the questions we actually ask ourselves to give you a sense of how we think about the opportunity. So the first one, obviously, are we the best place users turn when they need information or want to discover and be inspired. So things like queries and discover. And we\u2019re focused on providing better and more comprehensive answers to more types of questions, and we need to obviously deliver high-quality relevant info for all types of queries, including ones where they may be looking for a specific brand or product or just look for an inspiration. And how people search is changing, and it needs to become more multimodal, more conversational. So what does that mean for ads, for example. So getting user experience right across commercial quarries is essential way beyond, obviously, the area that you mentioned. And there is a lot of innovation that goes into this. The second part is really are we providing the most relevant ads when and where consumers are. And we only want to show ads when they\u2019re helpful to people. On 80% of the searches actually, we show no top ads and most of the ads that you see are on searches with commercial intent. And yes, we\u2019re -- for those with commercial interest, the question is really how do we provide the best answer in a way that\u2019s meaningful to users and where advertisers actually have something relevant to offer. And then the last, the third point is really the questions around -- and this goes again for the vertical you mentioned -- but for many, many beyond -- are we delivering most conversions for advertisers at the best ROI? And there\u2019s a lot of intelligence in our auction to deliver great ROI for advertisers, but there\u2019s always more we can do. And we\u2019re delivering -- or are we delivering the most relevant users by leveraging our users\u2019 signals? Are we building the best creatives by combining advertisers\u2019 assets in ways that make it compelling for user? Have we predicted the value of the user for that advertiser so we can help appropriately bid for each search with a unique user and query combinations we need? Can we fully measure what users do after they click on ads, from buying something to making phone calls or downloading apps and all across devices? So those are a lot of different things how we think about the runway ahead. Sundar Pichai : Maybe quickly on YouTube and commerce. Look, one thing I would say is across both Search, YouTube and other areas, there\u2019s a lot of common infrastructure that\u2019s getting done, right? So this is focused on merchants, onboarding merchants and all the back end so that we can have the broadest and the most comprehensive inventory available. And there, our partnership with other e-commerce platforms is a basic foundational layer we are putting in. And specifically on YouTube, while pretty early, there\u2019s a lot of pilots underway, just we have introduced a creative tagging pilot program so that we were had a choice to browse, learn and shop products featured in the favorite videos, piloted shopping live streams with brands like Walmart and Target and more broadly, including product feeds more globally in video action campaigns. So there\u2019s a lot more to do. Super early also on testing how shopping can be integrated with Shorts. And so again, early, but I find the opportunity space here pretty broad, and it\u2019s exciting. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Great. Thanks. Maybe one for Sundar and one for Ruth. First, on Search, very strong growth. Just maybe you could help us understand where you are in kind of the AI cycle of improvements there. There\u2019s still a lot of room to go there, you have highlighted in several earnings reports. And second, is there any fundamental reason why Search could be higher growth today than it was pre-pandemic? And then over to Ruth, Cloud had impressive growth. I\u2019m assuming the infrastructure layer is highest in the sector. And it grew 500 million plus quarter-over-quarter, but margins did come down. And so just kind of understanding what drove that? And then what it\u2019s going to take to really show a good leverage there? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On the first part, we obviously are investing deeply in AI R&D across both Google AI and Deep line and -- and so -- and then we take that and apply it across the company, but particularly in the context of Search. And so that\u2019s what underlies BERT, MUM, Pathways and LaMDA to power conversational experiences. And so, when I look at the tip of tree about -- as to where the research on the AI side is progressing, it\u2019s progressing at an incredibly rapid pace. We are committed to leading there. And then we have real good interfaces between the AI teams and our core product area teams, including Search to kind of productize this. So primarily, I think you\u2019re going to continue to see us lead in search quality. I just find the world of information is only continuing to grow, and it\u2019s getting increasingly multimodal in nature. Just like we took the leap from text to images, thinking through video, audio, incorporating it and then providing it back to users regardless of whether they are typing, speaking or looking at something wanting an answer. That\u2019s the journey between AI and Search, and we\u2019ll continue doing that. Ruth Porat : And in terms of Cloud, if we step back at the comments that both Sundar and I made, overall, we\u2019re very pleased with the ongoing progress in the business, and that\u2019s reflected in the revenue growth, as you noted, our backlog, the breadth of customer wins, the industry verticals. Our view is that we\u2019re in an extraordinary time to help customers digitally transform their businesses. And the key thing is we believe it remains very early innings. So as a result, our focus remains on revenue growth and investing as needed as we\u2019re looking over the long term. We\u2019re continuing to invest aggressively. And it\u2019s in our go-to-market capabilities. It\u2019s our products. It\u2019s our infrastructure. We do remain focused on the longer-term path to profitability, but we are continuing to invest here as we\u2019re seeing early innings and pleased with the ongoing progress. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Okay. I\u2019ll try two questions. I just want to follow-up on Justin\u2019s question about Search growing faster than pre-pandemic. I think, Philipp you talked about a couple of areas within search and retail is at the front of the list. I think you mentioned in a few other categories. Travel was always a big category. Do you feel like travel has come back full or is it -- travel is still sort of underperforming for macro reasons versus where it was pre-COVID? And then, Ruth, just on the share repurchases, I think that was a record level in the quarter. How should we think about the share repurchases going forward? To what extent is it opportunistic versus, I don\u2019t know, systematic or systemic way you think about returning cash to shareholders as every year, your free cash flow rises? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Yes. Thank you. Look, I said earlier that travel was a contributor to our year-on-year ads growth in Q4, and we were encouraged by the performance we saw throughout much of the quarter, but we found that user behavior tends to reflect what\u2019s going on in the world. And demand really continues to vary based on location and type of activity. And this has been more pronounced in light of Omicron. We\u2019ve seen changes in traveler search behavior as preferences have evolved such as searches for outdoor destinations like beaches, parks and camping have increased, while searches for museums, for example, have declined. Overall, I think it\u2019s fair to say that travel has generally been sensitive to outbreaks and that there\u2019s still unevenness that makes it too soon to say what trends are here to stay and which pre-pandemic habits are coming back. That said, as people think about where they want to go next, they\u2019re coming to us to help them navigate a patchwork of information. In fact, from the end of August to the end of October, searches for travel rules were up over 6 times globally year-over-year. And we\u2019ve launched a ton of new features to make it easier for people to understand changing travel restrictions and requirements. Similarly for travel partners, we\u2019ve pivoted our product strategy in big ways to help whether it\u2019s with Flight Demand Explorer and Travel Insights to help partners predict demand over making it free for hotel and travel companies and now to an activity operators to list their booking links. And I\u2019m sure you also saw our big sustainability in news in October, new info on CO2 and Google Flights, eco-friendly hotels, new eco-friendly routes and maps. So lots of important work is being done here actually to help our users and business drive more sustainable choices and just overall help our travel partners and the industry at large. Ruth Porat : In terms of the share repurchase, as we\u2019ve talked about on prior calls, we do view the share repurchase program as valuable and are pleased that we were able to increase the authorization to $50 billion last year. You\u2019ve seen that we\u2019ve increased the pace quite a bit over the last several years from $18 billion back in 2019 to $50 billion, as I said, for the full year 2021 and are just continuing to execute against it. We do have additional capacity under the existing authorization and just are continuing to execute against it, do view it as incrementally valuable. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Michael Nathanson : Thanks. I have a couple, Sundar and Philipp. Sundar, I\u2019m just interested in the decision you announced last week to move away from Federated Learning and go to Topics. So you could talk a bit about the reason and the rationale why you\u2019re making that change. When FLoC was first announced, it was patterned to be very effective relative to cookies as a signal for advertisers. What do you think is going to be the impact as you go away from cookies to topics on ROAs and budgets? And then Philipp, I think during the pandemic, one of the big growth spurts has definitely been connected TV. Can you talk a bit about what YouTube is seeing with Connected TV and how important of a driver is that? And then as hopefully we get back to normal, what are you doing on the product side to make YouTube on CTV even more engaging as time goes on? Thanks. Philipp Schindler : So I can take the one for Sundar. So the Chrome team has been really focused and working independently on Privacy Sandbox, which you all know is our initiative to build privacy preserving on device technologies that will power the future of digital advertising and obviously as a result of free and open web. And just last week, we announced our new Privacy Sandbox called Topics. And Topics was informed by our own learnings plus widespread, let me call it, community feedback from our earlier FLoC trials. It will now actually replace our FLoC proposal. I urge you all to read last week\u2019s blog for the details. But basically, the Topics API will allow advertisers to show relevant ads to people based on their interest inferred from the website they visit all in a more private way for users. And from an advertiser perspective, which is a big part of your question, it\u2019s obviously way too early to share more because we\u2019re just opening this up to the world. We expect to make it available for testing by the end of Q1, but we\u2019re really focused on designing for both parties from an advertiser and a privacy point of view and are committed to making sure goals are met on both sides. On the second one, the connected TV opportunity, streaming in the living room has exploded. We\u2019ve seen it firsthand. Connected TV is our fastest-growing screen, and we think there\u2019s a ton of runway ahead. Brands are getting the best of all worlds, the precision of digital with the scale of linear and a lot more relevance. They can personalize ads at scale and use video ad sequencing to tell powerful stories and we\u2019ve recently added action to the mix. Video action campaigns were upgraded in October to automatically include CTV inventory, which means users get a more helpful viewing experience and brands get to drive more online sales and/or leads. And just think about it like the traditional TV screen \u201cdesk screen\u201d that viewers have essentially stared at for decades, is now starting to come alive with the ability to drive conversions and it\u2019s pretty cool. Measurement is also obviously a key component to success here, and we want to make sure that advertisers can fully measure their YouTube CTV video investments across YouTube and YouTube TV for an accurate view of true incremental reach and frequency and so on. And the U.S. advertisers actually can do this now, if you have Comscore and Nielsen. So all-in-all, we are excited by the opportunities ahead with Connected TV. I think we\u2019re just getting started. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Ruth, it sounds like there was a good Q4 ad flush, the concept that, spend it, if you got it. And I\u2019m just curious about seasonality this year and if you expect the year to be more back-end loaded? Or do you feel like it\u2019s a little more balanced as we go through this year? Ruth Porat : So overall, we did see strength as we\u2019re going through the year. As I indicated, there was a broad-based advertiser strength. There was strong consumer online activity, and those were really the primary drivers. I think the one place that that comment might be more relevant is really in understanding the year-on-year within YouTube relative to last year, where there was strength. This year relative to -- there was real strength this year, but what we saw last year was more in line with, I think, your question, which was after a week beginning of the year, a very strong fourth quarter. Last year, we were lapping that very strong quarter last year. And so that explains some of the year-on-year growth comparisons. But overall, the key driver was the backdrop of broad-based advertisers support and spending? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Daniel Salmon : Great. Good afternoon, everyone. I have two questions for Sundar. First, Sundar, you mentioned that investment in artificial intelligence has helped the ads business significantly. What are the two to three ways that you think AI has helped your advertisers invest your ad revenue growth the most? And then second, we\u2019ve seen a variety of new bills introduced in the U.S. Congress recently that seemed to take in squarely at large technology companies like Alphabet. What do you think that these bills have right? And what do you think that they have wrong? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : So two things. On AI and advertising -- after I answer the second part, pass it to Philipp to give more details. But definitely, again, the overarching thing is the same AI advancements we want to make it simpler for advertisers to run campaigns, and there\u2019s a lot that goes behind it to drive that simplicity. And Philipp can give a bit more details there. On your question about Congressional antitrust bills. As a company, we have always been constructive in how we have approached and we are open to sensible updated regulations. It\u2019s important that technology is beneficial to society. And so for example, there are many areas where there\u2019s widespread agreement. We have call for privacy regulations, particularly at the federal level, updating productions for children and so on. On some of the current proposals, they quite don\u2019t address those issues. There are areas where we are genuinely concerned that they could break a wide range of popular services we offer to our users, all the work we do to make them -- make our products safe, private, secure, et cetera. And in some cases, can hurt American competitiveness by disadvantaging solely U.S. companies. So broadly, when we think about building many features, do we have to think on each feature, we shipped 3,000 features in Search alone every year. How do we make sure that complies with all the regulation, where do we proactively need approvals and so on. So those all can have unintended consequences. We\u2019re very worried about the impact on small business and local retailers as well as their customers as well. Having said that, we are committed to approaching it constructively. We always want to engage and do things in a way that\u2019s beneficial for society. And we have urged Congress to take time to consider the unintended consequences, and I think we\u2019ll remain focused on building great products for our users. Philipp Schindler : So back to the first question you asked on AI and the impact on our ads product. We cover -- Performance Max, we talked about it. We talked about Insights page. In Search, I would say we see an emergence of a real, let\u2019s call it, a better together story fueled by machine learning and automation. Advertisers are leaning more into automation using responsive search ads to create and select the best performing creatives, matching with more relevant search queries using broad match keywords, setting optimized bids with auction-time signals. We have smart bidding. So those are a few examples. We\u2019re using more AI to help advertisers measure their results and bid intelligently with data-driven attribution, for example, which uses very advanced ML to more accurately understand how each marketing touch point actually contributed to a conversion obviously, while respecting user privacies, broad matched keywords are a big part of this. We have responsive ads on display and discovery. They use text image and video assets from advertisers and predict the best combination of assets to show in any size or format on Google properties or the display network. Yes, so I think AI and ML will only get better and so will our tools, and we\u2019re helping advertisers lean into automation and identify new opportunities as a central part really of the recovery and growth strategies. Daniel Salmon : That is more than two to three. So thank you, Philipp for that, and thank you, Sundar, for your comments as well. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Stephen Ju : Okay. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll stick to one. So zooming out a little bit on the big picture. Sundar, I think it was almost four years ago when Google released a block post about the next billion users and how developing products for India and other emerging markets will hopefully inform what you should be doing everywhere else. So I think you have previously talked about Tez being a pretty notable example there. So can you talk about whether we should continue to be looking overseas to think about what direction you might take across your various products and services? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Stephen. Great question. And I think that trend is going to continue. You mentioned, obviously, payments. And definitely, it\u2019s informed our payment strategy globally. In general, we are trying to think deeper about these newer markets, both -- it really lines up with our mission of building a more equitable Internet for everyone. A couple of the things we have done recently. A year ago, we announced a $10 billion Google for India Digitization Fund. And it\u2019s a reflection of our confidence in the future of India, its digital economy, our desire to build products there, which we think will help us globally. And last year in October 2021, we announced a plan to invest $1 billion in Africa, again, with the goal of supporting entrepreneurs, helping businesses with their digital transformation and beginning to build products in Africa for African users, which I think will help us take learnings outside. I already see it. When I look at YouTube in India, some of the commerce ideas we talked about earlier, you may see us first stride in India first because we can get quicker feedback, very dynamic youthful population. And so we\u2019ll do it there and then roll it out globally. So we are constantly looking for opportunities like that. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks. James Friedland : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2022 call. Thank you and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. James Friedland : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Over the last few months, guided by our mission, we continue to develop helpful technologies with a view towards empowering both people and businesses. Even as more people return to in-person activities, we are seeing hybrid approaches to learning and working are here to stay, and our products are helping partners seize these new opportunities. To help support our own flexible work plans, this year, we plan to invest approximately $9.5 billion in our U.S. offices and data centers, creating at least 12,000 new Google jobs in the U.S. in places like New York and Atlanta. To enable our long-term growth, we are investing in areas like Cloud, AI, YouTube, Search and beyond. In 2020 and 2021 combined, we invested $40 billion in research and development here in the U.S. Beyond the U.S., we have announced new office investments in London and Warsaw and a new product development center in Nairobi. We are excited for the product development they will support. We'll share more about these investments at Google I/O, our annual developer conference on May 11, and I encourage you to tune in. Turning now to product highlights. AI continues to be at the heart of our core search and information products. We launched multisearch in Google Search this quarter. It's a new way people can find what they need using both images and words. For example, you can snap a photo of a shirt pattern and then type the word green to find a green shirt with that pattern. We also shared new features in Search to help people find health care providers who take their insurance and book appointments online. With ads automation, search ads powered by AI are helping our customers quickly respond to the market conditions most relevant to their business. Philipp will discuss this in more detail. Let's move to YouTube. We continue to support our community of creators, advertisers and viewers. With over 2 billion monthly signed-in users, we are well positioned to do this. YouTube, over the past 2 years, has seen significant growth and has become a central destination for entertainment, learning and educational content. And even as people have returned to in-person activities, time spent on YouTube has continued to grow. Just as YouTube evolve from desktop to mobile, and that created huge opportunities, we are excited about the new opportunities we see now. Short-form video is one. YouTube Shorts is now averaging over 30 billion daily views. That's 4x as much as a year ago. In the first quarter, we added new capabilities to video editing, and we are continuing to invest in making Shorts a fantastic experience for creators and viewers alike. As we've always done with products, we focus on building a great user experience first, and we will work to build monetization over time. The living room is another area of opportunity. On average, viewers are watching over 700 million hours of YouTube content on televisions every day. And in the year ahead, we will give YouTube's connected TV viewers new smartphone control navigation and interactivity features, allowing people to comment and share content they are watching on television directly from their devices. Turning next to our computing platforms. A few weeks ago, we marked a big milestone, our 100th release of Chrome and Chrome OS. Over the years, we have worked with developer and OEM partners to improve speed, simplicity and security and move the web forward. It's a great example of what we mean when we say we are building for the long term. And on Android, we'll showcase at I/O the many helpful features and services that Android and its platforms provide. Over the coming years, we will continue to invest in new form factors, seamless multidevice experiences and raising the bar for user privacy while giving developers the tools they need to succeed on mobile. As you know, we have made changes to our Google Play pricing model to help all developers on our platform succeed. Today, 99% of developers qualify for a service fee of 15% or less. While this impacted our short-term results, we think it's the right long-term approach to support the ecosystem and to be the most developer-friendly app store and gaming platform available. We are also exploring alternative billing options. And as we do this, we'll continue to uphold high safety standards that protect personal data and sensitive financial information. Earlier today, we launched the Data safety section in Play, where people can access more information about how apps collect, share and secure their data. In hardware, Pixel 6 is a huge step forward for the Pixel portfolio, and it's been great to see the response from Pixel users. It's the fastest-selling Pixel ever, and we are building broad consumer awareness of the brand and making good progress. I'm excited about the products we have coming and look forward to sharing more at Google I/O. Next, on to Cloud, where Q1 revenue grew 44% year-over-year with continued strong performance across Google Cloud Platform and Workspace. We continue to deliver differentiated products across 4 distinct areas. First, cybersecurity, where we introduced new offerings, including Assured Workloads to address digital sovereignty in the European Union; Virtual Machine Threat Detection, a first-to-market agentless malware detection capability; an advanced intrusion detection system for network threat detection. Organizations like T-Mobile and DoorDash are protecting their critical systems and data with Google Cloud's trusted cybersecurity products. These include Security Command Center, which helps many companies, including UKG, Ultimate Kronos Group, and Ocado Group, monitor and manage their security posture and risk. Our leading threat detection and response platform, Chronicle, is now paired with Siemplify to more quickly automate incident detection and resolution. We also announced our intent to acquire Mandiant, a leader in dynamic cyber defense and response, to help protect customers from the most advanced threats. Second, we continue to evolve a leading data cloud with serverless Spark to run batch Spark workloads; BigLake, a new storage engine that unifies data warehouses and lakes; and Dataplex, which provides unified management and governance of data across data warehouses and lakes. Our unified data cloud and AI platform is helping organizations like KeyBanc, LG Electronics, and Macy's work intelligently with data across multiple clouds. BigQuery, our leading solution for analytics, is helping customers like Kraft Heinz, Mercado Libre and [ Vertabelo ] to help create more personal consumer experiences. BT Group, UPS and other leading brands continue to tap our deep expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning to power their organizations. This includes our Contact Center AI platform, which helped The Home Depot improve their call containment by 185%, creating a more positive customer support experience. We are proud to share that more than 700 technology partners power their applications with our data cloud. Third, our open secure infrastructure remains a differentiator as it enables customers to run their workloads and apps where they need them. This is winning global brands like Dun & Bradstreet, Boeing and [ Kyocera ]. Our product leadership continued with the release of Tau VMs, which powers price performance that's more than 40% better than any other leading cloud; and Google Distributed Cloud Edge, a new edge solution designed to run telecommunication networks at scale, which is helping Bell Canada evolve its 5G network. And we further expanded our regional footprint globally. Leading companies like Mahindra are choosing us for large-scale IT transformations and migrating their data centers to Google Cloud, while Sony's Crunchyroll uses our infrastructure and networking capabilities to power the largest anime streaming service in the world. Our scalability enables Ninja Van, the leading logistics provider in Southeast Asia, to handle more than 10x their normal traffic during peak times. Finally, we continue to advance Google Workspace. To support hybrid work, we recently introduced new collaboration features, including bringing Google Meet directly into Google Docs, Sheets and Slides. You can now see and hear your team as you collaborate in real time without the need to schedule meetings. Google Meet can now live stream to up to 100,000 people who can also participate in Q&A and polls. We also launched the next wave of innovation in Google Docs with smart canvas, including auto-generated summaries and pageless format in Docs, smart chips and automating workflow using Gmail. Smart canvas has seen very rapid uptake with more than 6 million checklist and 6 million smart chips being added to documents each week. These innovations are helping employees adapt to hybrid work at large enterprises like Equifax and Ocean Network Express, digital natives including Flipkart and organizations like the University of Alberta. Finally, our Other Bets. This month, Waymo became the first company to run fully autonomous ride-hailing operations in multiple locations simultaneously. Today, employees can take rider-only trips in San Francisco, joining the growing number of public Waymo One riders in Phoenix. Wing launched its on-demand drone deliveries in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. In the first quarter of 2022, Wing completed over 50,000 commercial deliveries. That's up more than 3x year-over-year. As you know, sustainability continues to be a big focus for us. In addition to our own ambitious goals to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030, we recently joined Frontier, a new coalition with Stripe and many others, jointly committing more than $900 million to accelerate carbon removal solutions. Before I close, we remain deeply concerned about the war in Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the region. While I was in Warsaw, Poland last month, I met with many leaders across Central and Eastern Europe to reaffirm our commitment to the region. We are finding ways for our products and platforms to be helpful, including enhanced features on Search to help refugees find resources. Across all these efforts, I feel inspired by the ways that our teams at Google work to help people in moments big and small. With that, let me thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions this quarter. Over to you, Philipp. Philipp Schindler : Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. As always, it's great to be with you all. I want to start by echoing Sundar. The war in Ukraine and the deepening humanitarian crisis across the region is heartbreaking. As with our response during the global pandemic, we remain focused on how we can help, whether it's air raid alerts on Android phones to help Ukranians get to safety, refugee centers live on Maps or new attributes that let hotels share if they're offering free or significantly discounted accommodations for those in need or whether it's helping via Insights, which enabled Ukraine's largest person-to-person marketplace, OLX Ukraine, to pivot its product strategy nearly overnight to help people find essential products and services. Let's take a quick look at our performance this quarter before we dive into the trends that drove it. In Google Services revenues, we were pleased with the growth in the first quarter, up 20% year-over-year. Retail was again the largest contributor to year-on-year growth of our ads business in Q1, followed by travel. Speaking of travel, people are seemingly back on the move, whether they're searching for planes, passports or their next vacation destination. Q1 travel searches were above Q1 '19 prepandemic levels. Query growth in categories like beaches and islands were up 27% versus 2019, while vacation rentals rose 37%. Compared to last year, global searches for passport online jumped 80%, while searches for travel insurance surged 2x. We continue to launch new tools to help travel partners reconnect with customers and to help users find the trusted info they need to plan their next trip. In March, free hotel booking links expanded to Search and Maps. Travel partners can extend their reach. Users get a more comprehensive set of options. And earlier this month, we made it possible for hoteliers to easily share their rates and availability directly on Google via Business Profile. Let's talk Performance Max, our newest AI-powered campaign that allows businesses to harness the best of automation to drive the most optimal performance across all Google Ads inventory. Since launching globally in November, PMax has seen strong customer adoption, particularly among smaller businesses. PMax' simplicity shows how we're moving from a model in which businesses needed to understand the complex language of campaigns, keywords, CPC and so on to a model where we understand the company's goals and actively help them achieve their business objectives. Take ASSIST CARD, a leading LatAm travel assistance company who first tested PMax to accelerate its recovery in Argentina. Initial test to drive sales yielded a 40% lower cost per acquisition at a 15x higher conversion rate versus other campaigns with the same goals. Early success led ASSIST CARD to rapidly expand PMax to 9 other countries, including Brazil, Spain and the U.S., and significantly increased spend on the new format in 2022. Moving on to retail, where we had another strong quarter. Consumers are finding a new balance between online and in-person. Google Maps searches for shopping near me were up 100% globally year-over-year. People want to buy from brands that provide a seamless experience wherever and whenever they prefer to shop. For local businesses and big box retailers alike, this remains a big opportunity. Omnichannel is still a winning strategy. We're also continuing our investments to make shopping on Google as effortless, delightful and as engaging as possible. With rich, more immersive content, including more visual and browsable results for apparel and fashion searches and new advancements like multisearch in Google Search, which launched in beta for shopping queries earlier this month, we're helping people go beyond the search box to search anywhere and any way. Take AR beauty, which is still in its early days, but a great example of the innovative and cool experiences we're building to benefit both users and brands. Shoppers can now virtually discover and try on thousands of products from 90-plus brands, including Maybelline New York, MAC and Charlotte Tilbury as well as from retailers like Ulta Beauty right in Google Search. Let's move on to YouTube. Our brand business had a strong quarter. However, we did see more modest growth in direct response. For brand, we're enthusiastic about what's ahead for connected TV.  Brands are turning to us to tap into the shift to streaming and reach new audiences in smarter and more efficient ways. Over 135 million people in the U.S. were reached via YouTube on connected TVs in December. We've recently rolled out new tools to help advertisers consistently plan and measure their CTV spend across platforms. And later this year, in partnership with Nielsen, we'll help brands directly compare their YouTube reach to linear TV, including the ability to measure co-viewing. This apples-to-apples comparison will be a game changer in helping advertisers make smarter investment decisions. According to Nielsen, in the U.S., YouTube accounts for over 50% of ad-supported streaming watch time on connected TVs among people ages 18 and up. And over 35% of viewers in this group can't be reached by any other ad-supported streaming service. In other words, we're seeing that when users choose to watch ad-supported CTV, they choose to watch YouTube, and YouTube delivers CTV audiences that advertisers can reach anywhere else. Brands are taking notice, like Warner Bros., who leaned to YouTube to help drive awareness among key audiences for The Batman. By using a combination of best-performing video creative, connected TV media and video ad sequencing, Warner Bros. expanded its target audience in the 2 weeks leading up to its release, helping contribute to its successful $134 million opening weekend. For direct response, we continue to believe there's great opportunity to address commercial intent on YouTube between video action campaigns, app campaigns, product feeds and new live commerce features. As Sundar mentioned, Shorts is another area we're really excited about. Engagement is strong, and we're focused on delivering great experiences for users, creators and advertisers. In fact, we're testing ads on Shorts with products like app install and video action campaigns. And while it's still early days, we're encouraged by initial advertiser feedback and results, which brings me to our partners and how we're closely collaborating with them to grow and evolve healthier, sustainable ecosystems and bring them the best of Google. We continue to focus on accelerating growth in India's digital ecosystem and are excited about our expanding partnerships with a number of partners in the region. Then Sundar mentioned Sony's Crunchyroll. Beyond Cloud, we're working across Android, Google Play, Google TV and more to help Sony and Crunchyroll acquire and retain more users and fans and strengthen its leadership in the direct-to-consumer anime streaming market. As always, I want to extend deep appreciation to our customers and partners for their collaboration and trust and to our product, engineering, partnership, sales and many support teams. Thank you. Your relentless focus on helping our users, customers and partners makes our success possible. Now over to Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Philipp. We had a strong first quarter with revenue growth led again by Search and Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $68 billion, up 23% or up 26% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenues was $29.6 billion, up 23%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $17.6 billion, up 22%. The biggest factors here were costs associated with data centers and other operations, followed by content acquisition costs, primarily driven by costs for subscription content and then costs for YouTube's advertising-supported content. Operating expenses were $18.3 billion, up 24%. Headcount growth was the primary driver of expense across all 3 categories : research and development, sales and marketing and G&A. Growth in sales and marketing also reflects an increase in advertising and promo expense as we ramped back from the lower levels of spend last year. Operating income was $20.1 billion, up 22%. And our operating margin was 30%. Other income and expense was a loss of $1.2 billion, which was driven by unrealized losses in the value of investments in equity securities given market volatility. Net income was $16.4 billion. We again delivered substantial free cash flow with $15.3 billion in the quarter and $69 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $134 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repurchased a total of 52 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in the last 12 months. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $61.5 billion, up 20%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $39.6 billion in the quarter were up 24%, led again by retail, followed by continued recovery in travel. YouTube advertising revenues of $6.9 billion were up 14%, reflecting ongoing strong growth in brand and more modest growth in direct response. The deceleration in the year-on-year growth rate primarily reflects lapping of the exceptional performance of direct response that we called out in the first quarter of 2021. Network advertising revenues of $8.2 billion were up 20%, driven by AdSense and AdMob. Other revenues were $6.8 billion, up 5%. The growth rate reflects substantial growth in YouTube nonadvertising revenues driven by subscriber growth in YouTube Music and Premium and YouTube TV, which were largely offset by a year-on-year decline in Play revenues, primarily as a result of the pricing changes that we've discussed with you previously. In terms of costs within Google Services, TAC was $12 billion, up 23%. Google Services operating income was $22.9 billion, up 17%. And the operating margin was 37%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $5.8 billion for the first quarter, up 44%. GCP's revenue growth was again greater than Cloud's, reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by solid growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $931 million. As to our Other Bets for the first quarter, revenues were $440 million, and the operating loss was $1.2 billion. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. We're pleased with our strong results in the first quarter, which reflect the benefit of investments we've made over many years. We remain committed to investing to continue to build helpful technologies in support of long-term growth notwithstanding the uncertainty in the global outlook. The most visible reflection of our focus on long-term performance is our continued investment in talent and compute capacity across the company. In terms of outlook by segment for Google Services, the revenue growth rates we delivered in 2021 in our advertising businesses benefited from lapping the COVID-related weakness in 2020. Obviously, we will not have that tailwind for the rest of this year. As discussed in prior calls, the largest impact from COVID on our results was in the second quarter of 2020, which means that in the second quarter of 2022, we will face a particularly tough comp as we lap the recovery we had in the second quarter of 2021. Additionally, the second quarter results will continue to reflect that we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia. Within other revenues, in the first quarter, the substantial growth in YouTube subscription revenues was offset by a decline in Play revenues versus the first quarter last year due to the fee changes we previously announced. These fee changes will continue to affect our results throughout 2022 until we lap the introduction of the changes. Turning to Google Cloud. Cloud's performance in the first quarter reflects growing deal volume and strength across multiple industries and regions. Customers are increasingly choosing Google Cloud to help them digitally transform their businesses using our global infrastructure offerings, our data analytics and AI capabilities and the collaboration benefits of Workspace. We continue to invest aggressively in Cloud given the sizable market opportunity we see. At the Alphabet level, reported revenues in the first quarter reflect that the U.S. dollar strengthened versus last year, with a 3-point headwind in Q1 compared with a 2-point tailwind in the first quarter of 2021. In the second quarter, the impact from foreign exchange rates will have an even greater impact on year-over-year comparisons given both the larger tailwind last year and the increase we expect in the headwind in Q2 versus Q1 based on current spot rates. With respect to Alphabet headcount, we added 7,400 people in the first quarter, and the majority of hires were for technical roles. The biggest increases in headcount this quarter across product areas were again in Cloud for both technical and sales roles. Turning to CapEx. The investment in the first quarter reflects the timing of closing for several large acquisitions of office facilities, which converged in the first quarter. More specifically, of the total, nearly 4 billion covers the purchases in New York, London and Poland that we had mentioned previously. We continue to expect a meaningful increase in CapEx in 2022 versus last year. For the balance of 2022, the increase will be particularly reflected in investments in technical infrastructure globally with servers as the largest component. As stated in our press release today, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $70 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in a manner that's in the best interest of the company and its stockholders. Thank you. And now Sundar, Philipp and I will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have 2. The first one, Ruth, wondering, could you talk to us at all about sort of the shape of the ad business growth throughout the first quarter, understanding there's some uncertainty around Ukraine, et cetera? And then what have you seen sort of quarter-to-date in the overall Search business from a growth perspective? And then the second one for Philipp. Appreciate all the color on Performance Max. Can you just talk to us a little bit about -- strategically about how long we should think about it takes to drive broader adoption of these type of tools with your sales forces at months, quarters, years? Where are you in SMB adoption? How long do you think it takes to get broader and maybe full adoption of a product like that? Ruth Porat : Thanks, Brian. So in terms of the ad business, I would say, as I did in the opening comments, we were very pleased with the year-on-year Search revenue growth in the first quarter, up 24%. And it really reflected the strength that we've seen in retail, as Philipp and I commented on. I would say -- as you're asking how are we looking forward, I would say the revenue growth rates that we delivered in 2021 in Search and across our advertising businesses more generally, as I said in the opening comments, did benefit from lapping the COVID-related weakness in 2020. So I think one key point is that we're not going to have that tailwind for the rest of this year. And as I noted, one of the key areas to focus is Q2 of 2020. That was where we had the largest impact from COVID. So that means in the second quarter of 2022, we're going to face a tough comp, as I said. I would say, in addition, the second quarter results are going to continue to reflect that we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia. And then I noted the impact of foreign exchange. So as we're looking at it generally, we feel good about what we're doing in the business, a couple of key points that I called out there. Philipp Schindler : And to your question on Performance Max, which we covered last quarter as well, maybe just a quick recap. It really brings together the best of Google's automation to help advertisers maximize their reach and efficiency across our channels. Using the same input, we can now serve campaigns on multiple inventory formats, expanding an advertisers' reach with the same effort. And by the way, just today, we announced new features for Performance Max, including new customer acquisition goals, new campaign level insights. More details about the one-click upgrade tool for Smart Shopping and Local campaigns. So we're very, very committed to helping Performance Max deliver for our advertisers and have been very open to advertiser feedback how we can do this. And specifically on your time axis, I don't think there is a material difference to the time axis that we've looked at in previous rollouts. As always, focused on generating the maximum value and performance for our advertising partners. Operator : And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Maybe one follow-up to Brian's question. Other industry players have called out pockets of weakness in brand advertising globally in the quarter that you just reported. Did you see any of that from a volatility standpoint, especially around maybe the war in Ukraine for a period of time in March? And then sticking with all the commentary you gave on YouTube, how should we be thinking about the strategic goals of driving longer engagement and user growth and monetization for you to begin some of the initiatives you called out versus how to think about the performance of the business as we go through '22, short-form video versus long-form video or maybe mix of direct response versus brand advertising? Ruth Porat : Great. So I'll start on the first question and revenue impact. I think you are asking from the war and anything else that was relevant there. I would say the most important, as both Sundar and Philipp said, is what a tragic humanitarian crisis this is. And across Google, we're doing a lot to provide support. In terms of revenues, the most direct impact is the fact that we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia, as we announced in early March. And to your question, about 1% of Google revenues were from Russia in 2021, and that was primarily from advertising. In addition, from the outset of the war, there was a pullback in advertiser spend, particularly on YouTube in Europe. So a couple of impacts from the war. And I guess over to Philipp with respect to YouTube and trends there. Philipp Schindler : So maybe to dig a little deeper into the part of your questions around Shorts. Shorts went global, rolled out to over 100 countries, and as Sundar mentioned, now has 30 billion daily views, which is 4x higher than a year ago. And if we take the creator view, we're taking a fresh look at what it means to monetize Shorts and reward creators for their short-term videos. The first step, I think, is our $100 million YouTube Shorts Fund, which is now available in over 100 countries globally. And over 40% of creators who will receive payment from the Shorts Funds in 2021 weren't in the YouTube Partner Program, just as an interesting number. And then on the advertiser view side, as I mentioned earlier, we're testing ads on Shorts with products like app install and Video action campaigns and are encouraged by the early results. And so all in all, I think we're deeply committed to supporting the next generation of mobile creators here on YouTube and are very actively working on what monetization could look like in the future. Operator : And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : I have 2. First, just on advertising. Just thinking about industry conversations, it seems pretty clear that you were able to capture some dollars that shifted to search from social related to Apple's iOS privacy changes. Just curious if that dynamic continued in 1Q. And then if you can comment at all on just how you think about sustainability of those dollars going forward. And then, Ruth, in terms of spending and on the margin side, operating margins continue to be strong at 30% even with the greater headcount of the past couple of quarters. Just hoping you could elaborate a little bit on what you mean by considered investments and in what areas are you able to offset and gain more efficiencies in the business. Ruth Porat : Thanks for the questions. So with respect to Search and ATT, there's really nothing to highlight. We haven't seen a noticeable shift in spend. And then in terms of overall margins and how we're thinking about investing, what I tried to make clear is we do continue to plan to invest aggressively this year. I made that point in opening comments with respect to both ongoing hiring at a rapid clip as well as ongoing investment in technical infrastructure. And I would say in terms of margins, we do remain focused on investing for long-term value creation. And as we noted, last year, in 2021, our margins did benefit from substantial revenue growth, while at the same time, expense growth ramped more gradually during the year. And in certain respects, as we talked about last year, margins benefited from what I described as a bit of a timing difference between revenue growth and expense growth. And there were 2 other benefits worth calling out that we talked about last year that affected operating margin. The first was the impact from the change in useful lives that we called out last year, and that benefited the year-on-year growth in expenses last year. And the second was the impact of foreign exchange, which was a tailwind last year, but as I noted, has really flipped to a headwind given the strength of the U.S. dollar. And as a reminder, the impact of foreign exchange is greater on operating income than it is on revenue given our expense base is weighted towards the U.S. with most of our R&D efforts located here in the U.S. So the main thing is, the key point, we are very focused on long-term value creation. And in our view, given the opportunities we see, there are some key investments that we're continuing to make. Operator : And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : A couple of things. First on YouTube, quite a ramp in Shorts activity. Has that been a little bit of a headwind for growth as you ramp that up, and we can try to guess on monetization later? And then secondly, when you think about regulation in Europe, there's a lot of headlines about the Digital Market Act and other things. How do you think about the regulatory environment and the evolution over the next couple of years? Ruth Porat : Thanks for the questions. So in terms of YouTube, I think there are a couple of questions in your question. In terms of the deceleration in the year-on-year revenue growth rate relative to the first quarter, the largest factor was lapping an exceptionally strong quarter in direct response, as we noted last year. In addition to that direct response lapping, there were a couple of other items worth noting. First, as I've already mentioned, the war that did have an outsized impact on YouTube ads relative to the rest of Google. And that was both from suspending the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia as well as, as I noted earlier, the related reduction in spend primarily by brand advertisers in Europe. Then in addition, as we mentioned on the third quarter earnings call, we continue to experience a headwind from ATT primarily in direct response. And the dollar impact from ATT has been consistent since it was implemented in April of last year. And then there's the FX headwind I've already commented on. I would say to the other part of your question, we're experiencing a slight headwind to revenue growth as Shorts viewership grows as a percentage of total YouTube time. We are testing monetization on Shorts, and early advertiser feedback and results are encouraging. And the team is focused on closing the gap with traditional YouTube ads over time. So we're excited about the new opportunities with Shorts, but a slight headwind. Sundar Pichai : On the second part of the question about DMA and -- regulation. Look, we support a number of DMA's goals, including expanded consumer choice, interoperability. Obviously, the implementation deals will be important, and we are still -- it's too early to tell, but we'll be working as we have done over the past many years. We'll be engaging constructively, including regulatory dialogue, to understand and make progress. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Mark Stephen Mahaney : Okay. I'll stick, please, with YouTube questions. That kind of brand softness in Western Europe, Ruth, does that look like that has already abated? Or does that look like that's continuing? And if you step back and just look at overall YouTube usage -- and I know you mentioned some numbers in the prepared comments. Just given the much broader array now, I think, of content options, including in short-form video and long-form video, are you seeing the overall growth -- any impact on the overall growth in YouTube users or in engagement per YouTube user? Ruth Porat : So in terms of the first question, impact from the war, I think it's too early to comment. Tragically, it is still ongoing. So too early to comment there. And then overall, in terms of YouTube and engagement, I noted on both YouTube's advertising business as well as the subscription businesses, the performance there, I'd say, over the past few years, we've seen significant investment in online video. There's been a ton of innovation. We think innovation is positive. Broadly, we continue to benefit from the fact that there are 2 billion logged-in viewers who visit YouTube every single month. And people are creating comment -- content on YouTube at a very active rate. We're really pleased with what we see there, and our team does remain focused on innovating and helping creators grow. As Sundar said, Shorts now has 30 billion daily views. That's 4x higher than a year ago. And I think that really goes to your question about the level of activity that we're seeing. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Michael Nathanson : I have one on YouTube, of course, and then one for Ruth. On YouTube, I think what we're hearing is that there's emerging concern that TikTok is a competitor to YouTube's mobile position. And I know you called out the strength of Shorts, but can you talk big picture if you're seeing any meaningful shift in consumer demand to the mobile YouTube product? And any type of advertising maybe shift on mobile because of TikTok? And then to Ruth, it's an odd quarter because if you look at APAC, the APAC region underperformed EMEA, which had Russia and Ukraine in there. Is there anything you want to call out about Asia Pacific this quarter, why it could have been softer? Or any other product that may have led to a bit of a slower quarter for APAC? Philipp Schindler : Look, maybe I'll start on the first part of your question. It's very similar to what Ruth said before. I mean we've seen significant investment in online video, and there's been a ton of innovation. But there are 2 billion plus logged-in viewers who visit YouTube every single month, and more people are creating content on YouTube than we've ever seen before. And the team remains very focused on trying to help creators grow, trying to innovate. And just to give you a number, 2021, the number of YouTube channels that had made at least $10,000 in revenue was up more than 40% year-over-year. And we're heavily investing in Shorts, in the connected TV and shopping. You heard the stats from Sundar on the 30 billion daily views. So we continue to invest and new monetization options for creators beyond ads are a big part of what we're doing. And as I said before, testing ads on Shorts are encouraged by initial results. Ruth Porat : Yes. In terms of geographic color, just to even broaden out your question a bit more and go through the various regions, so in the U.S., we were pleased with the 27% year-on-year growth. And I think nothing to call out there. In Europe, as you noted in your question, the slightly bigger impact from the war in Ukraine than in other regions, and then the sizable delta between fixed and floating really reflects the meaningful strengthening of the dollar versus the euro. I guess to the heart of your question with respect to APAC, the main thing there is to take you back to a year ago, we were lapping a substantial 39% growth rate in constant currency. And so this really reflects lapping that sizable growth relative to more muted ads performance in APAC this first quarter, and it really takes you just back to last quarter. In other -- Americas, it was much more about the FX headwind more than anything else. Operator : And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent Thill : For Sundar, just on Google Cloud, if you could just walk through the next leg of growth, where you're most excited for the rest of '22. Sundar Pichai : Thanks. Look, overall across the board, I'm excited because you saw in my earlier remarks there's a lot of product innovation across the key areas, be it data and analytics, cybersecurity, our open multicloud as well as Google Workspace. So when I look at the innovation in the product pipeline and the overall demand we are seeing and how early our journey is, there's definitely a lot to look forward to. Cybersecurity has been a particular focus. We obviously are excited about our acquisition of Mandiant, which I think will help us serve customers deeper as well. But overall, the execution has been great. We are scaling up, particularly in our go-to-market as well. And I think that will play out well. And over time, as we focus on converting bookings to consumption as well, I think it will play out well, taking a long-run view and methodically scaling up and executing better. So that's what I'm excited about. Operator : And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Stephen Ju : So Sundar, I think your Search team recently released a block posting, talking about the desire to help your users with their management of money. And I think we talked about some of this last time with the rollout of Tez in India and the evolution to Google Pay, but can you talk about your ambitions to add more utility to the service so that it becomes more, hopefully, indispensable service for your user base and particularly as you hope that this theoretically becomes your next billion user product? Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Stephen. Obviously, we've been focused on making sure payments works well. One, maybe you can step back and think about it as that our payment strategy is very similar to the strategy we have for commerce overall. We want to make all of this work easier, both on the merchant and the financial institution side, and making sure they can connect with the customers well. And you mentioned the work in India that was certainly what really got everything started. We are now -- 150 million people across 40 countries are using Google Pay. And your questions about making -- first of all, we're making sure it works across the board, works well, easy to use for all the sites. And then over time, we will innovate and build new digital experiences. Simple examples you saw was we rolled out the ability for users to pay for parking on Google Pay with their voice just using Google Assistant. So really building for scale, building for simplicity. And then over time, we will layer on additional helpful features. But we are definitely focused on the first part now, making sure it works well for as many users across the world. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Dan Salmon from BMO. Daniel Salmon : I have 2 questions. First, I'd like to ask about Google Analytics, where there's been a transition ongoing for a year or so now to a new version of the product and where you'll begin sunsetting the older version next year. That's always a really important tool for advertisers and publishers to measure the impact of your advertising. So could you tell us a little bit more about those changes, how they may or may not be related to the deprecation of cookies in Chrome and how you plan to ensure its smooth transition? And then second, one last one on YouTube. You mentioned the strong performance in subscriptions, Ruth. Any products that you would highlight that are driving that strength in particular? Philipp Schindler : So I can take the one on the Google Analytics side. This is something we've been working on for a very long time. There is no specific relation to what you've mentioned. This is one of the normal upgrades to our products that we're doing on a quite regular basis. We're very excited about it. Advertisers are excited about it. Our partners are happy about it. So this is -- yes, this is a nice one. We like it. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of the YouTube subscription businesses. As I said, they continue to deliver substantial revenue growth, and that was driven by subscriber growth for both YouTube TV as well as YouTube Music and Premium. So pleased with what we're seeing there. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks. James Friedland : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2022 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. James Friedland : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.  With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.  And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm proud of how our teams continue to build helpful products and experiences for people and partners. Reflecting this, our performance in Search in the second quarter was strong. We are also seeing momentum in Cloud.  With an uncertain global economic outlook, our strategy to invest in deep technology and computer science to build helpful products for the long term is the right one. Our ability to take the long view stems from our timeless mission, to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.  At Google I/O in May, I talked about 2 key ways we move that mission forward, advancing both knowledge and computing. Those goals are at the heart of what we do. We know that our services are particularly helpful to people and businesses during uncertain moments, whether it's using Search or YouTube define anything from anywhere or highly efficient tools like Search Ads that help businesses of all sizes reach customers or Google Cloud, which helps companies adapt to hybrid work and find efficiencies. We'll continue to invest in areas like AI, Search and Cloud, and we'll do it responsibly and in a way that is responsive to the current environment. Earlier this month, I announced that we'll be slowing our hiring and sharpening our focus as a company. We are focused on hiring engineering, technical and other critical roles. And we are working to improve productivity and ensure that the great talent we do hire is aligned with our long-term priorities.  Turning now to product highlights. Years ago, we made a big bet on AI. We believe that it would be transformational for our business and for the world. We are still in the early days, yet AI already underpins many of our most helpful products and services. For example, AI is helping us create entirely new ways to search. People are using Google Lens to do visual searches more than 8 billion times per month. A new feature called multisearch helps people find what they need using words and images at the same time.  Later this year, multisearch will be able to help people find local results near them. AI is also helping improve translation. With the new monolingual approach to translation, we've added 24 new languages to Google Translate, spoken by 300 million people. And a new immersive view in Maps uses computer vision, AI and billions of images to create high fidelity representations of places around the world.  Beyond AI, we are also seeing a new frontier with augmented reality. We have been testing exciting prototypes in our labs like the device we shared at IO that puts real-time translation and transcription in your line of sight. It's one example of how AR can solve real needs in the real world. And last week, we announced that we will soon begin early testing of AR prototypes in real-world scenarios. Our goal is to learn how they can help people in their everyday lives. Our investments in commerce are another way we deliver helpful experiences. People are shopping across Google more than 1 billion times each day. We see hundreds of millions of shopping searches on Google Images each month. Merchants will soon be able to submit 3D images of their products to appear directly on Google Search. So customers can try before they buy. We're also focused on bringing together hardware, software and AI in a range of helpful devices. At IO, we announced great new products, including Pixel 6A, Pixel Buds Pro and Pixel Watch. We are currently taking preorders for Pixel 6A and Pixel Buds Pro. It's been great to see the positive feedback so far.  And on platforms, I'm proud that Android remains the world's most popular operating system with more than 3 billion monthly active devices worldwide. Last year alone, consumers activated 1 billion Android phones. We are making it easier for Android users to share photos and communicate with friends and family with a modern messaging standard called Rich Communication Services or RCS. Across our platforms and beyond, we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. Safe browsing on Chrome browsers help protect billions of people every day by warning them when they try to access dangerous sites or files.  Earlier this year, we rolled out a new machine learning model that identifies more than twice as many potentially malicious sites and phishing attacks as the previous model, helping to contribute to a safer and more secure web. We've also unified our password managers across Chrome and Android. Now stored passwords can be grouped and protected across devices, apps on the web.  Taking a closer look at YouTube. YouTube Shorts are watched by over 1.5 billion signed-in users every month with more than 30 billion daily views. In Q2, YouTube TV surpassed 5 million subscribers, including trailers. There's also a lot of potential for shopping on YouTube. Just last week, we announced a partnership with Shopify.  It will help creators easily connect their stores to YouTube and enable shopping across their live streams and videos. There's more to come here. Moving on to Cloud, which surpassed a $6 billion quarterly revenue mark for the first time. Q2 revenue grew to $6.3 billion, with momentum across Google Cloud Platform and Workspace.  We saw continued demand in all geographies with global brands like Target in North America, H&M Group in Europe, Banco BV in Latin America and BioPharma in Asia. We launched Google Public Sector in June, expanding our commitment to help U.S. government agencies and public institutions accelerate their digital transformations from New York State and Arizona State University to the U.S. Forest Service and the state of Rhode Island. Customers are choosing Google Cloud as their technology partner because of our leadership in 4 areas. First, we continue to lead in the data cloud market because we unify data lakes, data warehouses, data governance and advanced machine learning into a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud.  Companies like S.C. Johnson, Northwell Health and the Golden State Warriors choose Google Cloud for our strength in data analytics. Our capabilities helped Swiss Air optimize its flight operations. They're also helping Engie explore ways to optimize wind energy management and [indiscernible] to create smarter factory floors. Second, companies like BetaBank and Mayo Clinic choose their open cloud infrastructure to modernize their IT systems on our cloud at the edge or in their data centers. Our infrastructure scales to help customers like Deutsche Telekom modernize its network, Wipro to modernize its core systems and Garvan Institute of Medical Research to process 14,000 genomes in under 2 weeks. Our multi-cloud strategy remains a differentiator for customers like Elevance Health formerly known as Anthem and AMD. Third, cybersecurity. Google has always provided a secure cloud infrastructure, and we continue to introduce new cybersecurity products that help customers deduct, protect and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats.  Customers like GitLab, Highmark Health and Iron Mountain protect their critical systems and data with our products. [ Carryable Coffee ] and Etsy are among the 5 million websites protected by our cybersecurity technology. Finally, Google Workspace's easy to use and secure communication and collaboration tools continue to be chosen by many organizations as they return to hybrid work. Google Workspace helped St. Luke's Medical Center, a leading health care system in the Philippines address a 38% increase in telehealth visits during the pandemic.  Results like this are driving growth in many customer segments around the world, including digital natives like Canva, large enterprises like Travis Perkins plc and public sector institutions, including the Central Dutch Government. Finally, our other bets. Waymo expanded rider-only testing with employees to include Downtown Phoenix and started testing at Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport. It also began charging trusted tested riders in San Francisco, a step closer to launching a commercial service with fully autonomous trips.  Waymo also opened a new facility to support Waymo Via, their autonomous Class 8 trucking solution as they continue to increase their operations and investment across the Southwest region. Calico is testing an investigational drug treatment in patients with ALS, developed in collaboration with AbbVie. It's an early step of many in the development process. Wing recently surpassed 250,000 commercial deliveries and unveiled a series of delivery drone prototypes able to carry different sized packages. There is good progress here and will continue to be intentional across the portfolio. To close, while the economic outlook is uncertain, it's been great to see people gathering in person again. We are pleased to see people coming back into the office more often, resulting in more opportunities for collaboration. It's a privilege to build technology that's helpful in both good times and uncertain ones. And I want to thank everyone at Alphabet and Google for their work and support of people, businesses and all of our partners everywhere. Over to you, Philipp. Philipp Schindler : Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. It's always great to be with you all. As Sundar indicated, we're as focused as ever on helping businesses navigate complexity and operate from a position of confidence. AI-powered tools, insights and automation are arming customers and partners with the ability to stay agile and responsive so they can capture short-term opportunities while also building for the long term. You've seen our own commitment to the long term in our latest innovation announcements at IO, Google Marketing Live and Brandcast. Sundar covered a number of these. I'll dive deeper into a few more, including how we're improving our advertiser experiences and building simpler, more useful products for our partners.  Within Google Services, Search delivered strong revenue growth in the second quarter, driven by performance in both travel and retail. In travel, users appetite continued to remain strong heading into the summer season. Searches for places to visit in summer were up 2x globally year-over-year, while searches for last-minute hotel deals were up 50%. However, as we've all seen in the news recently, the travel sector has been experiencing some challenges. As always, we're committed to helping our travel partners navigate this with insights and new tools. Then there's retail, where we had another solid quarter. At GML, we highlighted how we're continuing to innovate to help merchants make the most of how quickly consumer shopping is evolving, like Best Buy was embracing a full omnichannel approach from measurement to bidding to using omni ad formats across Google. By adopting omni across its local inventory ads portfolio and showcasing curbside and in-store pickup, Best Buy increased in-store revenue from Google Ads by 34% last year.  Today's customers expect to shop wherever, whenever, and they care as much about local as they do about finding inspiration for the next purchase online. In Q2, searches for open now, near me were up 8x globally year-over-year, while searches for designer outlet jumped 90%. We also saw strong interest in apparel categories like women's clothing and in beauty categories like perfume and fragrances. With AI-powered tools like Performance Max, which local and smart shopping campaigns will upgrade too in time for the holidays, we're helping businesses move at speed and scale to reach new and existing customers wherever they are in their shopping journey with relevant, useful content. We've seen strong momentum with P-Max. Advertiser adoption is up 5x year-to-date. Sustainable Apparel brand, Rothy's drove a 59% increase in conversions and a 60% increase in revenue after turning to P-Max. By leveraging its creative assets and showing them at scale, Rothy's reached more customers in a way they hadn't been able to do before. Innovating across Search and YouTube also remain top priorities. Sundar mentioned new 3D AR features. Target and Wayfair are testing these to help customers see and shop products in real life. We launched new ad formats for more visual browsy search experiences. And then there's cool live commerce capabilities like live direct which let creators start a shopping live stream on their channel and then redirect viewers to a brand's channel for more. Let's dive deeper into YouTube. In the second quarter, the biggest factor in the year-over-year comparison was the lapping of a very strong second quarter in 2021 when we experienced a strong recovery from the impact of COVID in early 2020. Ruth will provide more details on this later on. As we continue to help advertisers manage through uncertainty, I would point out 3 key highlights for YouTube. First, Brandcast joined the upfronts in New York in May for the first time ever, a reflection of how digital and linear TV worlds are converging for both viewers and advertisers. As the #1 streaming video platform to reach viewers across all devices with billions of hours of video watched every day, YouTube remains well positioned to deliver the reach, results and relevance that advertisers need.  In fact, even in TV's biggest moments, YouTube is still delivering huge incremental reach. According to Comscore, 49.9% of adults that saw a Super Bowl ad on YouTube on the day of the Super Bowl did not see the add-on TV. And as more advertisers tap into connected TV, they're also driving results.  According to Google Commission Nielsen meta-analysis of MMMs that measured YouTube CTV and TV across U.S. consumer packaged goods, on average, YouTube CTV effectiveness was 3.1x greater than TV. Take GSK Consumer Healthcare, now Haleon, who piloted CTV campaigns across its top 10 global markets to drive effectiveness at scale and tap into the shift to streaming. The results, 73% of campaigns drove substantial lift in brand and unbranded searches, and viewers were up to 14x more likely to search for Haleon related terms.  Adding CTV to its existing plans also led to greater efficiencies and savings. Haleon has since opted its 2022-2023 investment and is now expanding CTV across LATAM and EMEA markets. Second, as Sundar said, our momentum in Shorts continues. Last quarter, we shared that we're in the early stages of testing monetization with ads, and we continue to be encouraged by the results so far. Third, there's full funnel, which we've covered before, and more advertisers are embracing. On average, YouTube advertisers using a full funnel strategy experienced 80% unique reach across brand and action campaigns. With this incremental reach across upper and lower funnel formats, advertisers meet different audiences based on where they are in the purchase journey. Estee Lauder Taiwan's recent campaign for its advanced night repair serum is a great example. Branded content collaboration with top creators raised awareness, while YouTube shopping shelf feature boosted consideration and to generate new leads and sales, a series of well-orchestrated action formats did the trick.  This full funnel strategy drove 29% more unique visits to its website and a 95% increase in sales. With our performance products, advertisers can confront demand. With our massive reach products, they create net new demand at scale. Lastly, an update on how we're bringing the best across Google to our partners and key ecosystems.  First, in gaming to help Bandai Namco entertainment drive immersive gaming experiences and build a more robust IP strategy. We're partnering across Cloud, Geo, Ads, YouTube and more. And then there's news. Google News Showcase now has 1,500-plus partnerships with publications across 17 countries, including recent agreements with publications in the U.K., Romania and Slovakia. I'll close, as I always do with gratitude for customers and partners and for Googlers across sales, partnerships, product engineering and our many, many support teams. Thank you for your tireless commitment to making a positive impact around the world. Ruth, over to you. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Philipp. Our financial results for the second quarter reflect strength in Search and momentum in Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise.  I will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $69.7 billion, up 13% or up 16% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenues was $30.1 billion, up 15% primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $17.9 billion, up 17%.  The biggest factor here was costs associated with data centers and other operations. Operating expenses were $20.1 billion, up 24%, reflecting the following : first, the increase in R&D expenses, which was driven primarily by headcount growth. Second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses, which was driven primarily by increased spending on ads and promo followed by headcount growth.  And finally, the growth in G&A, which reflects increases in both professional service fees and in head count, partially offset by a decline in charges related to legal matters. Operating income was $19.5 billion, flat versus last year, and our operating margin was 28%. Other income and expense was a loss of $439 million. Net income was $16 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $12.6 billion in the quarter and $65 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $125 billion in cash and marketable securities.  Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $62.8 billion, up 10%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $40.7 billion in the quarter, were up 14%, driven by both travel and retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $7.3 billion, were up 5%. The modest year-on-year growth rate primarily reflects lapping the uniquely strong performance in the second quarter of 2021. Network advertising revenues of $8.3 billion, were up 9%, driven by AdSense. The quarter-on-quarter deceleration in both YouTube and network advertising revenues primarily reflects pullbacks in spend by some advertisers.  Other revenues were $6.6 billion, down 1%, reflecting a year-on-year decline in Play, primarily driven by the fee changes we have discussed previously. We also saw a slowdown in buyer spend due to a number of factors, including lower engagement levels compared with earlier stages of the pandemic.  In terms of costs within Google Services, TAC was $12.2 billion, up 12%. Google Services operating income was $22.8 billion, up 2%, and the operating margin was 36%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $6.3 billion for the second quarter, up 36%. GCP's revenue growth was again greater than Cloud's, reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by solid growth in both seats and average revenue per seat.  Google Cloud had an operating loss of $858 million. As to our other bets for the second quarter, revenues were $193 million and the operating loss was $1.7 billion. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. In terms of the Google Services segment. We are pleased with our performance in Search in the second quarter, which continued to deliver strong results.  As a reminder, the 2022 revenue growth rates are presented against particularly tough comps as we lapped the recovery in the second quarter of 2021 from the impact of the pandemic in early 2020. Going forward, the very strong revenue performance last year continues to create tough comps that will weigh on year-on-year growth rates of advertising revenues for the remainder of the year.  In YouTube and Network, the pullbacks in spend by some advertisers in the second quarter reflects uncertainty about a number of factors that are challenging to disaggregate. Within other revenues in the third quarter, we expect an ongoing headwind from the fee changes and the slowdown in buyer spend that impacted results in the second quarter.  Turning to Google Cloud. Customers are transforming their businesses, utilizing GCP's secure infrastructure with data, analytics and AI capabilities, uncovering real-time insights and leveraging the collaborative tools of Workspace. They are in the early days of this transformation, and we continue to invest in our products, go-to-market capabilities and cloud regions. In terms of foreign exchange, our second quarter results reflect the U.S. dollar strengthened versus last year from a significant tailwind last year to a 3.7 percentage point headwind in 2Q. Looking to the third quarter, based on strengthening of the U.S. dollar quarter-to-date, we expect an even larger headwind from foreign exchange. As a reminder, all segment revenues are reported on a GAAP basis. We provide fixed FX revenues only at the consolidated level and by geographic region. In addition, as we've said previously, the impact of foreign exchange is greater on operating income than it is on revenues given that our expense base is weighted more toward the U.S. with most of our R&D efforts located here. With respect to Alphabet head count, we added 10,108 people in the second quarter with the majority of hires for technical roles. Given the uncertain global economic outlook and the hiring progress achieved to date, as Sundar previously announced, we intend to slow the pace of hiring. We expect our actions on hiring to become more apparent in 2023. Our headcount additions in the third quarter will reflect we already have a strong number of commitments, including new graduate hires.  As a reminder, we also expect the acquisition of Mandiant to close by the end of the year, which will further increase head count on top of hiring. Although we expect the pace of headcount growth to moderate next year, we will continue hiring for critical roles, particularly focused on top engineering and technical talent. Turning to CapEx. The largest investments in the second quarter were in servers followed by data centers and office facilities. After several large transactions closed in the first quarter, investment in office facilities was once again focused on fit-outs and ground-up construction on existing projects. We continue to expect an increase in CapEx in 2022 versus last year. For the balance of 2022, the increase will be particularly reflected in investments in technical infrastructure globally with servers as the largest component. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp, and I will now take your questions. Operator : And our first question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : Great. Hopefully, you can hear me. I want to ask 2 questions. First, Sundar, just in your letter, you talked about how the economic challenges will serve as an opportunity for Alphabet to deepen its focus and invest for the long term. Just wanted to get a sense of how that might change the investment profile in areas of priority for the company. And then, Ruth, I was hoping you could provide some color perhaps on how growth trended more through the second quarter? And if you have any comments on what you're seeing so far in 3Q in July? Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Doug. As I said to the company, I think it's a good time to sharpen our focus. Personally, I find moments like these clarifying. It's a chance to digest and make sure we are working on the right things as a company with taking a long-term view, making sure we are continuing to invest in deep technology and computer science and doing differentiated work.  And it gives a chance to assess everything we are doing with the critical lens and reallocate resources to our most critical priorities. So it's a constrained optimization problem. I think it gives us a chance given the strong -- given a few years of strong growth to double down and focus and we're going to be very disciplined in terms of how we will approach it. But our focus on the long-term areas, be it AI, be it Cloud and other critical areas, will continue. Ruth Porat : In terms of your second question, I'm going to leave the modeling to you. Just a bit of context, Sundar and I, I think, Philipp, as well used the term uncertainty because we do think that's the best way to characterize what we're seeing the data are complicated.  Our results have reflected lapping, continue to reflect lapping of the significant growth rates last year. On top of that, there is uncertainty in the global economic environment. And then, there are issues that differ across industry. You've seen it in the news for some it's supply chain, for some it's inventory issues. So we will leave the forecasting to you and try to give you sort of the components as we went through Q2 here. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : Sundar, I just wanted to sort of follow up on the last question a little bit. I think your -- the tone around investment for the year changed somewhat over the course of the last few weeks, you've kind of gone through July and heard about slowing of hiring and now reported hiring pause. You mentioned just recently, you're finding moments like these to sort of optimize spend. Could you just talk to what are you seeing in your business specifically on the advertising side or the cloud side that you sort of saying now is when we really do need to make sure we're optimizing. Are you seeing pullbacks? Or is it more sort of just you're seeing the macroeconomic headlines and wanting to get ahead of it? Sundar Pichai : I think Ruth gave color on what we are talking about as uncertainty. I think we see that as well. All of us are reacting to quite a varying set of dynamics, and it's tough to summarize it because the factors -- underlying factors are different and they vary by maybe geography and verticals. But there is some commonality to it in terms of the macro environment. So there's definitely something we are looking at and want to be more disciplined as we go forward. So that's the higher-level theme. I think in terms of underlying areas, pretty much I'm focusing my time on what are the right set of things to do with a longer-term view. And I do think as a company, when you're in growth mode, it's tough to always take the time to do all the readjustments you need to do and moments like this gives us a chance. So I view it as an opportunity. And so some of the sharpening our focus is taking advantage of the moment. Operator : And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Maybe I can ask a 2-parter on YouTube. You've called out the tougher comps over the last couple of quarters. Can you give us a better sense of how you move away from some of those tougher comps in the periods ahead of us, over the next 12 to 18 months and how maybe we should think about the digestion of the direct response growth and consumption growth that YouTube saw a year ago and how that might lead to better growth ahead for YouTube in the periods going forward.  And then when you look at the broader competitive landscape for video. How do you think about positioning YouTube, short-form video versus long-form video or enabling creators and businesses to have tools to build their businesses within YouTube. How do you think about product development and aligning the product against the broader competitive landscape? Ruth Porat : Thanks, Eric. There was a lot in your question, so I'll start and then I'll pass it to Philipp. An obvious point as we're pointing out the lapping of what truly were extraordinary growth rates as time will get us through the lapping. So that's obvious math, but you asked the question. So starting with that. And then I did note that we have seen pullbacks in spend by some advertisers that, in fact, was the biggest factor in the quarter-on-quarter change, the sequential decline in the growth rate. And we're -- that we do view that as rather idiosyncratic as I said, some of it is supply chain, some of it's inventory. And so just working through that. And then I would say, there were a couple of other factors that were relevant. The war was a modest headwind to year-on-year and sequential growth. AT&T impact, in fact, remained relatively constant. We've said that for the last couple of quarters. So that does remain a headwind. So we're working through those. But again, it goes really to continuing to invest in YouTube and the experiences and the opportunity to deliver for our entire ecosystem; users, creators. And why don't I pass it to Philipp to maybe take you a step deeper into those. Philipp Schindler : So despite the pullback from some advertisers, we really believe YouTube remains well positioned to benefit from the shift to digital video -- maybe first on brand. It's worth calling out that this was our first year participating in the upfronts, which is really exciting and really a testament to YouTube's evolution, and we were very pleased with our strong growth and upfront commitments.  Customers tell us they see value in YouTube's reach and the ability to drive results. I talked about CTV earlier and as well on our last call, and we are very excited about the road map here. We're also continuing to give advertisers unique and creative storytelling opportunities and the ability to lean into very precise KPIs and we recently rolled out some very critical measurement tools. On the direct response side, we still think there's a lot of runway to address commercial intent on YouTube between video action campaigns and app campaigns and product feeds and new live commerce features, where we're testing a number of different things across live commerce. So we're excited about the opportunities here, especially to connect brands with creators. We're also seeing advertisers by YouTube at both ends of the funnel, which I talked about earlier, giving advertisers the ability to drive reach and relevance and action is really where YouTube excels. So the big picture in long term remain very encouraged by the opportunity for innovation at  [ branded DR ] and across YouTube. And I can also briefly touch on the Shorts piece. Consumers are increasing and consuming short-form videos obviously. We're seeing this across multiple platforms, including YouTube. Sundar noted earlier that Shorts are being watched by 1.5 billion plus logged-in users every month. So overall, we're continuing to see good user engagement on YouTube. And last quarter, we shared that over the past 2 years, YouTube has seen significant growth in watch time and even as people have returned to in-person activities. Time spent on YouTube globally has continued to grow. And as I said before, early results in Shorts' monetization are also encouraging, and we're excited about the opportunities here. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Michael Nathanson : Can I ask one to Ruth and Sundar and then one to Philipp.  So Ruth and Sundar, given just how strong this company is in terms of balance sheet and profitability, I wonder what's your north star when you think about shopping your focus? What's driving your decision-making? Is there an optimal margin you're looking to seek to or cash generation. So I'm just trying to get -- when you say these things, I know what other companies have to do because they are pressured on balance sheets and profitability. So what is the mathematical form that you're looking for that you're driving towards? And then to Philipp, I think people are wondering just -- and this is a big question, but the composition of the ad base and I think people are worried that some other companies may have really benefited from a lot of growth in younger, newer companies that were not profitable. So can you just talk a bit about what you're seeing in terms of mix of your composition. Is there any shift maybe towards Fortune 500 companies that are spending more from a healthier maybe starting base? Anything you tell us on composition of your ad base? I know it's a huge question, but that would be helpful. Sundar Pichai : Maybe one thing I'll say through moments like this, look, I think for a few years, we've been talking about, particularly in our newer areas, the focus on building sustainable value. And so for me, it's a long-term framework. We are obviously -- we have areas where we've been doing this for a long time, like Search and so on. But there are newer areas, and we definitely want to make sure while we are investing for the long term, we are thinking through the business model, the value creation and profitability over time.  And so all of that are the frameworks we use. And I think it's important, regardless of the health of your balance sheet on an area by area. Everything you're building is sustainable on its own and you're very disciplined and so I think times like this gives us a chance to bring more focus and spend more time on with that lens. Ruth Porat : I would just add, we talked about this last year. Some of the operating margin upside last year was due to timing issues with the search of revenues, and we indicated at the time there was a lag in part on some of the investments whether that's data centers or otherwise.  And so in part, you're seeing some of that. But very much to Sundar's point, the way we look at it is we are continuing to invest in long-term growth that has paid wonderful dividends for users and investors over the years. And we want to make sure we're doing it responsibly and judiciously.  Some of these things pay out over the medium and longer term. And so as he said a couple of times now, this notion of wanting to look at what are meaningful investments to deliver continued -- extraordinary experiences for [ servers ] and users that then supports longer-term growth. It requires investments, and we just want to make sure that we're getting that balance right and that we're using resources effectively where we can to redeploy it and put it back into long-term investments. And so it's that sort of balancing act. Philipp Schindler : Look, when it comes -- when it comes to the second part of your question, we have a very, very broad base of customers; large, small, different verticals, different sectors and different geographies across the world. They're very proud to serve such a large base with such a diversity of different players.  It's a broad question you're asking, if you're leaning a little bit more towards the total addressable market here. Let me reiterate what I said before. We're not just addressing above-the-line marketing budgets, like traditional advertising or television advertising. There's a lot of upside that we've seen below the line, budgets, whether it's promotional pricing, product placements, sponsorships and so on and [indiscernible] cuts across the universe of different players, sectors, verticals that I just described. But in the end, our main goal is on delivering great experiences for our users and driving incremental ROI for advertisers and then making them successful across all this big universe of sectors I just talked about. And I'm positive that budget should continue to move our ways as long as we stay focused on this one. Operator : And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : I hope you can hear me okay. I wanted to ask about Cloud. You mentioned several times Cloud momentum, and I know it was a very tough year-over-year comp, but growth did slow.  Wondering if you're seeing any pullback in new lift and ship projects or other new client adds? Or if you're seeing a little slowdown in volumes at all. And then on the margins, is there any urgency to move margins towards breakeven? Or is it still kind of investment mode here with a lot of different products and services to build? Sundar Pichai : On Cloud, we continue to see strong momentum, substantial market opportunity here and still feels like early stages of this transformation. Constantly in conversations with customers, big and small, who are just undertaking the journey. So it kind of shows you the opportunity ahead.  I would just say nothing noticeable other than -- given we are in different geographies and different sectors. You do see a varying mix of some customers impacted in terms of their ability to spend, some customers just slightly taking longer, longer times. And maybe in some cases, thinking about the term for which they're booking and so on. So -- but I don't necessarily view it as a longer-term trend as much as working through the macro uncertainty everyone is dealing with. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of your margin question, our view continues to be that this is an extraordinary opportunity. It's a long-term opportunity and enterprise customers are still early in their move to the cloud. And so we do very much have that debate that same question that you posed is the right one, which is a trade-off as between revenue growth and immediate profitability. And what we're focused on is ensuring that we're investing to support the long-term growth and given the upside that we see. And so continue to focus on it and are looking at the path to profitability, path to free cash flow positive to drive attractive returns. That's obviously in the overall model of it, but I very much believe in the long-term growth and believe this is the right level of investment across the business, go to market, the product teams continuing to build it out globally. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent Thill : Ruth, good to see you lean into the buyback? I think it was your highest buyback ever, while other tech companies have kind of run away from it. I'm just curious if you could talk about your capital allocation strategy and ultimately how you're thinking about the buyback? Ruth Porat : Thank you. I mean at the heart of the capital allocation strategy is really what we've been talking about on this call, investing in long-term growth and driving cash flow. So we have the opportunity to continue to invest and return capital to shareholders.  We're very pleased that we were able to increase the authorization up to $70 billion. And do continue to believe it's yet another valuable tool in the overall set of investments that we make. So pleased to have it. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Mark Stephen Mahaney : Philipp, you talked about the beginning of monetizing YouTube Shorts. Do you have any lessons that you've drawn so far? Or in the long term, is there any view you have on whether that inventory can be better or less monetized than other YouTube inventory that you've had traditionally historically? And then secondly, just on these comments on the pullback by some advertisers. So you talked about strength in retail and especially in travel, so what's left? Does that mean are you seeing weakness out of Western Europe in financial verticals and maybe automotive? Any color on which advertisers are pulling back would be helpful. Philipp Schindler : So on the Shorts side, on the monetization side, I am sticking with the statement I made before. We are encouraged by the results that we're seeing. We're excited about the opportunity. And there's not more -- not a lot more detail that we can share at this point in time.  On the pullback in spend by some of the advertisers, as Ruth mentioned, pullbacks and spend on YouTube and network by some advertisers in the second quarter reflects uncertainty about a number of factors. And for each advertisers, they're actually challenging to disaggregate the uncertainty -- difference between companies and sectors. And as you can see from the news and some companies were impacted by multiple factors as well. Operator : And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Colin Sebastian : Maybe 1 follow-up, Sundar, on the sharpening of the focus you talked about, of course, AI and Cloud as being key areas of long-term focus. Are there any areas worth calling out that may be a lower priority now given that focus? And then secondly, you've given us some good data over the last year or so around conversational and visual search queries and strong growth there. Curious how that also translates into maybe different types of monetization relative to tech space search? Does this give you greater monetization capability in Search? Or how would that impact monetization? Sundar Pichai : Good question. And look, one way we can think about it is through moments like this. So for example, we are obviously investing deeply in AI. We do everything from pure research to applied research to research, which is now -- things -- AI work, which is actually happening very close or within the areas like Search and YouTube, et cetera. And so you can imagine a scenario in which we are prioritizing and on the margin moving resources to making sure we are driving product improvements, which flow through a moment like that. That would be an example of sharpening focus for me. And when I think about the opportunities out of AI, just coming out of I/O this year, looking at the progress we have made, how much we have made progress with multisearch, how multimodal things are getting and the fact that people are now actually doing voice searches a lot, visual searches a lot, all that is a good example of how we are driving value in our core products. Similarly, if you take at ads at Google Marketing Live, the team talked a lot about AI-driven products and features that really give value to advertisers in the most privacy-forward way. And cloud is, I would say, lot of the AI opportunity today plays out as more from a data analytics standpoint. It's within that segment, we see the most strength. But over time, I think there'll be broader opportunities as well. And on top of it all, we are continuing to see a lot of breakthrough work coming from our research teams, be it LaMDA 2, PaLM, Minerva or some of our recent advances. So we'll stay cutting-edge drive progress and keep focusing on turning that research into real products and applications, and we'll take a long-term view. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. Ross Sandler : So maybe just following up on the retail segment. So some of the biggest retailers in the world like Walmart are really struggling and are looking to cut costs and sounded to me from what Ruth just said about supply chain inventory inflation that they might be cutting on YouTube. So I'm just curious, can you flesh out what you guys are doing in Search from a product perspective to keep that retail category as strong as it is? You mentioned P-Max for some of the smaller advertisers, an omnichannel for the larger, but maybe just elaborate on how that -- what strategy do you guys are using to keep that spend flowing? Or is that just a timing thing and it might drop off at some point in the future? Philipp Schindler : Yes. This is an excellent question. As I noted in my opening remarks, retail continued to be an important driver of Search in the second quarter. We saw strong Search interest in several categories I called out, apparel categories like women's clothing earlier.  I think it's also worth clarifying when we talk about retail growth. We're talking about our overall approach to retail, which runs through all of our ads products and surfaces and our shopping strategy is just one important piece of that. From a trend perspective, you're absolutely right, omnichannel remains the way to when retailers continue to build their digital presence to drive both online and offline sales, and we're obviously helping them do it. Over the last few quarters, I think I've talked quite a bit about the ways how we're doing this. In Q2 -- like in Q1, we saw a year-over-year increase in adoption of, for example, local inventory ads. These are mobile first and location-based and helping businesses of all sizes showcase their products and stock in-store, online or available for store, curbside pickup, all different variations. Additionally, we're midway through the migration from smart shopping campaigns into Performance Max, which we also mentioned and advertisers have been pleased with increased reach and the increased performance. And our focus really has always been on building tools and features that help both offline and online businesses connect directly with these customers across our platforms, and we're excited about what's next for retail commerce across our services, especially Search and YouTube. And we will remain focused on building helpful great products and experiences for both users and these businesses. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks. James Friedland : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2022 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. James Friedland : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat.  Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC as updated in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, expected to be filed with the SEC later today. During this call, we'll present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our financial results for the third quarter reflect healthy fundamental growth in Search and momentum in Cloud. Our reported results reflect the effect of foreign exchange. The growth in our advertising revenues was also impacted by lapping last year's elevated growth levels and the challenging macro climate. We are sharpening our focus on a clear set of product and business priorities. The product announcements we have made in just the past month alone have shown that very clearly, including significant improvements to Search powered by AI, new ways to monetize YouTube Shorts, which will support the creator ecosystem, the strong series of hardware launches and a new partnership and product announcements at Cloud Next. These will all drive value for users, partners and our business. We have also started our work to drive efficiency by realigning resources to invest in our biggest growth opportunities. Over the past quarter, we have made several shifts away from lower priority efforts to fuel higher growth priorities. Our Q4 headcount additions will be significantly lower than Q3. And as we plan for 2023, we'll continue to make important trade-offs where needed and are focused on moderating operating expense growth. Throughout Google's history, periods of dedicated focus have enabled us to emerge strongly and unleash new areas of computing innovation. For example, over a decade ago, focusing the company's efforts on mobile helped us to build and grow our business for the shift to mobile computing. We are at a similar point now with AI, another transformational technology. Our investments in AI and deep computer science mean that we can deliver a wide range of breakthroughs across our products and services to help people, businesses and communities. Turning to the quarter. First, our core information products. At our Search On event, we shared how we are using AI advances to deliver a more natural and intuitive search experience. These advancements will soon help to surface things you might find helpful before you even finish typing. We are also making visual search more natural than ever before. People now use Google Lens to answer more than 8 billion questions every month using just a photo or an image. Now we are supercharging our visual search capabilities to help people find what they are looking for at businesses nearby. Philipp will also talk in more detail about our work to make it easier to shop on Google, a key focus. Google Lens also has an amazing translation feature. It can now blend translated text seamlessly into the background of images, like menus or street signs in just 100 milliseconds, shorter than a blink of an eye. Through advanced language models, AI is unlocking new experiences that support more natural and conversational ways to interact with computing. LaMDA is one of our most promising models for this. It's now available to demo in our AI test kitchen, which offers a way for people to experience and give feedback on emerging AI technology. DeepMind also debuted its most helpful and safest language model yet. Sparrow can talk to users, answer questions and provide evidence-based answers using Google Search. Moving to YouTube, another big priority. We remain focused on long-term growth for our community of viewers, creators and advertisers. To that end, we announced some exciting changes at our Made on YouTube event last month. First, improving the monetization of Shorts. This is a big deal for creators and for our business. We'll introduce revenue sharing on Shorts early next year. This update makes YouTube the only platform where creators can monetize their content across short, long and live formats at scale. Shorts continues to show great user momentum, and we continue to invest in our mobile video tools for creators. We are seeing mobile-first creators investing more in the platform, creating content that helps the broader community grow. TV is a big area for us as well. Nielsen reported that YouTube was the leader in streaming TV viewership in the U.S. in September for the first time. Turning next to hardware. Hardware is an important area of investment for us. We are investing deeply from the silicon to the OS to powerful software experiences because it's a big opportunity to move computing forward and build deeper relationships with people who love using Google products. It also really helps to guide the Android ecosystem beyond just building the underlying platform. Earlier this month, we introduced the Pixel 7, the Pixel 7 Pro and the very first Pixel Watch. We've also previewed more detail about the Pixel Tablet, which is coming in 2023. Pixel combines our foundational technologies, AI, Android and our Google Tensor G2 processor to bring state-of-the-art AI directly to the device. The Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro offer industry-leading photography features that can unblur or sharpen photos and shoot cinema-quality videos. We recently had our highest selling week ever for Pixel, and I'm really proud of the positive reviews so far. Along with great devices, we introduced our latest release of Android. Android 13 offers new personalization features, improved privacy controls and a more seamless experience with connected devices. Next, Google Cloud. We see continued momentum with Q3 revenue of $6.9 billion with Google Cloud Platform's revenue growth rate above the aggregate. I've long shared that cloud is a key priority for the company. The long-term trends that are driving cloud adoption continue to play an even stronger role during uncertain macroeconomic times. Google Cloud helps customers solve today's business challenges, improve productivity, reduce costs and unlock new growth engines. At Cloud Next, we unveiled more than 100 new products and announced new and expanding relationships with Toyota, Prudential plc, Coinbase and AppLovin. The shift to hybrid work continues with organizations evolving to support an increasingly distributed workforce. I'm proud to share that Google Workspace is now used by more than 8 million businesses and organizations worldwide. That includes Korean Air as well as the U.S. Army, which is transitioning 250,000 personnel to our secure communication and collaboration platform. In the past year, we have announced nearly 300 new capabilities to support hybrid work. Empowering a distributed workforce brings an increased need for cybersecurity to keep workers' data and critical business systems safe and secure. It's top of mind for nearly every CEO I speak with, and customers, including the City of Los Angeles, Roche and Banorte put their trust in Google Cloud's industry-leading products, our new Chronicle Security Operation Suite, Unify Security Analytics, Automation Response and Threat Intelligence. This has helped Vertiv analyze 22x more security data while cutting investigation time in half. In September, we closed our acquisition of Mandiant and are proud to welcome more than 2,600 colleagues to Google. With Mandiant, we add industry-leading threat intelligence and incident response capabilities to help customers stay protected at every stage of the security life cycle. Customers partner with Google Cloud because we offer a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud. Our leadership here is winning customers across industries, including the state of Hawaii and the Australia Securities Exchange. Our capabilities help solve difficult business challenges like supply chain and logistics while also creating new growth opportunities. And as companies globally are looking to drive efficiencies, Google Cloud's open infrastructure creates a valuable pathway to reduce IT costs and modernize. In addition, with our new Media CDN product for large media streaming workloads, we are helping Major League Baseball and Paramount+ deliver flawless experiences to their customers. And with Google Cloud Edge, Rite Aid is more efficiently helping patients in their pharmacies. Across all of these areas, I'm proud of the trust and enthusiasm our customers are placing in Google Cloud. Briefly on our Other Bets, Waymo announced that Los Angeles will be its third ride-hailing city, joining Phoenix and San Francisco. Waymo will begin by mapping several neighborhoods in LA as it prepares to serve people there. Wing just surpassed 300,000 commercial deliveries. It's servicing new areas in Australia and announced its first drone delivery trials in Ireland. To close, times like this are clarifying. As we head into 2023, we are going to focus on our most important priorities as a company. To support our growth, we'll continue to invest responsibly for the long term in a way that is responsive to the current economic environment. I want to thank our employees around the world for their contributions over the last quarter. We help people, our partners and society when we focus on what we do best and execute on that really well. Over to you, Philipp. Philipp Schindler : Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. It's great to be joining you all today. Google Services revenues of $61 billion were up 2% year-on-year, negatively affected by a sizable foreign exchange headwind. Search and other revenues grew 4% year-over-year to $40 billion, led by travel and retail, while both YouTube Ads and Network had modest year-over-year revenue declines.  Other revenues were up 2% year-over-year with growth in YouTube non-advertising and hardware revenues offset by a decrease in Play revenues. Play revenues were lower due to a number of factors, including a decline in user engagement and gaming from the elevated levels seen earlier in the pandemic. Among other factors, this shift in user behavior also created downward pressure on our advertising revenues, with lower revenues from ad promo spend on YouTube, Network and Play Ads in Search and Other. I'll highlight a couple of other trends that affected our ads business in Q3, and Ruth will provide more detail. On the second quarter earnings call, we noted a pullback in spend by some advertisers in YouTube and Network, and these pullbacks in spend increased in the third quarter. In Search and Other, the largest factor in the deceleration in Q3 was lapping the outsized performance in 2021. In the third quarter, we did see a pullback in spend by some advertisers in certain areas and search ads. For example, in financial services, we saw a pullback in the insurance, loan, mortgage and crypto subcategories. There's no question we're operating in an uncertain environment, and that businesses big and small continue to get tested in new and different ways, depending on where they are in the world. When it comes to how we're helping, our focus remains unchanged. The same AI driving breakthroughs in everything from protein folding, flood forecasting and language understanding is also fueling innovation across our Ads product. Via insights, automation and easier-to-use advertising tools and formats, we're helping businesses stay agile, build resilience, anticipate the future and show up for customers in more connected, visual and consistent ways. We're helping them understand demand, deal with inventory challenges, increase loyalty and much more. In challenging times like these, advertisers are carefully evaluating the effectiveness of their budgets. Search tends to do relatively well in such an environment, given its strong measurability and focus on delivering ROI. It's also well suited to quickly adjust to changes in consumer behavior. And when Search is coupled with our automation products across bidding, creatives, targeting or Performance Max, it can drive performance even further. Let's talk retail, an important vertical for us. No matter where shoppers are buying, whether it's in store, online or both, we have the solutions to help them deliver results wherever their customers are. Take online fashion retailer REVOLVE, who used its global influencer network along with our category insights and automated tools to acquire new customers at lower costs. As festivals and events returned to summer, REVOLVE used lower funnel solutions across search and shopping to engage with consumers in high-demand apparel categories, helping it cross $1 billion in trailing 12-month net sales for the first time. And then there's Magazine Luiza, a large Brazilian retailer, who embraced omnichannel by measuring and bidding directly to store sales. Coupled with in-store pickup and notations via PMAX, Magazine Luiza drove a 38% ROAS over 30 days and has since expanded the strategy to all eligible products, including 8 million-plus new offers. And whether shoppers know exactly what they're looking for or are just seeking inspiration, we're innovating to make it easier and more engaging for people to shop online across our services. From finding the best deals across all types of merchants, including 200 million-plus available daily deals in Q3 to new ways to search. Now when you type shop followed by whatever item you're looking for, you'll unlock a visual content stream of ideas that feel just like window shopping but online. And then there's YouTube. Not only can users now buy more products and videos, but shopping as entertainment experiences are bringing the magic of our creators to the shopping experience. Like in September, when Kylie and Kris Jenner hosted an exclusive shopping stream event to celebrate the debut of a new Kris collection for Kylie Cosmetics. And at Adweek last week, not only did we announce that product feeds are coming to Discovery, but that creators will soon be able to take products from brands across their videos, Shorts and live streams. This means viewers can shop products seamlessly while they watch their favorite content, while merchants can drive incremental reach and engagement for free listing offers when tagged by creators that viewers love and trust. I already touched on YouTube's performance in the quarter. Let's deep dive into what we're focused on. First, we're helping advertisers understand how they can drive effectiveness with every campaign they run on YouTube. Full funnel is a key way to do this. Buying YouTube across consideration, awareness and action allows marketers to meet customers at different stages in their purchasing journey, which we know are increasingly complex while delivering towards a key business goal. Creative and Media work together across the funnel to create new demand and convert current demand. Castlery, a single full furniture retailer activated a full funnel approach as part of its U.S. expansion. It used brand and action formats, identified its most relevant audiences and built a robust measurement framework to boost sales and awareness, including a 65% increase in U.S. brand searches. Castlery is using the same strategy for the upcoming holiday season. Two other areas where we're continuing to invest, Connected TV and Shorts. First on CTV. Eyeballs keep moving away from traditional TV. On average, global viewers are watching 700 million-plus hours of YouTube content on TV daily. And according to Nielsen, during the 2021-2022 U.S. broadcast seasons, YouTube reached more viewers during primetime on CTV than any linear TV network. Brands continue to take notice. Like Instacart, who tapped into CTV to maximize its TV screen strategy for its The World is Your Cart brand campaign featuring Lizzo. It drove breakout searches for its product and above-average brand lift across awareness, consideration and purchase intent. And it also engaged a significant increase in audience on top of TV with 66% lower CPMs. And then there's Shorts. 1.5 billion users every month, 30 billion daily views. Engagement is strong. We've always said that we focus on building great user and creator experiences first and then follow that with monetization over time. As of September, ads on Shorts have officially launched via video action, app and Performance Max campaigns. As Sundar mentioned, we also extended the YouTube Partner Program and announced our revenue sharing model for Shorts creators, the first of its kind for short-form content. It's early but we're encouraged by the progress we've made this year in Shorts monetization and support for sustaining the creator ecosystem. I'll close with something I've said before and I think it's worth reiterating. Our success is only possible when our customers and partners succeed. Whether it's helping individual YouTube creators or Play developers make a living and build thriving businesses or bringing the best across Google to our partners, our focus on driving growth for our partners and key ecosystems remain steadfast. I'm proud that over the past 3 years, we've paid creators, artists and media companies over $50 billion. In terms of how we're helping our partners innovate, I'll share 2 highlights. First, a transformative partnership with Transion, the #1 OEM in Africa and Pakistan, will help to close the digital divide by doubling annual activations by 2025 and build helpful products for the next billion users. And then in commerce with FEMSA Digital in Mexico, we're bringing together solutions across Ads, Cloud, Maps, Waze and beyond to bolster its data and analytics capabilities so it can better reach and retain its beverage and retail customers. On behalf of many, a massive thank you to our customers and partners for their collaboration, trust and feedback and another massive thank you to our sales, partnerships, product, engineering and support teams. The hard work, dedication and ingenuity of Googlers, especially during more challenging times, is truly second to none. On that note, over to you, Ruth. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Philipp. Our financial results for the third quarter reflect healthy fundamental growth in Search and momentum in Cloud. Our reported results clearly reflect the effect of foreign exchange. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the third quarter, our consolidated revenues were $69.1 billion, up 6% or up 11% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenues was $31.2 billion, up 13%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $19.3 billion, up 20%. The biggest factor here was costs associated with data centers and other operations, followed by hardware costs. Operating expenses were $20.8 billion, up 26%, reflecting the following : first, the increases in R&D and G&A expenses, which were driven primarily by headcount growth; and second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses, which was driven primarily by increased spending on ads and promotions, followed by headcount growth. Operating income was $17.1 billion, down 19% versus last year and our operating margin was 25%. Other income and expense was a loss of $902 million. Net income was $13.9 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $16.1 billion in the quarter and $63 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $116 billion in cash and marketable securities. Let me now turn to our segment financial results. As a reminder, we provide fixed foreign exchange revenues only at the consolidated level and by geographic region. All segment revenues are reported on a GAAP basis. Starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $61.4 billion, up 2%. Across our advertising revenues, the year-over-year deceleration in growth rates versus the third quarter of last year was largely driven by lapping very strong performance, most notably in Search and other revenues. Additionally, the year-on-year deceleration on YouTube and Network reflects a pullback in spend by some advertisers as we first noted last quarter. In terms of the revenue lines, Google Search and other advertising revenues of $39.5 billion in the quarter were up 4%. YouTube advertising revenues of $7.1 billion were down 2%. Network advertising revenues of $7.9 billion were down 2%. Other revenues were $6.9 billion, up 2%, reflecting several factors : first, subscriber growth in YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV continued to drive ongoing strong growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues; second, we delivered solid growth in hardware revenues, primarily from sales of the Pixel 6A. Finally, the growth in these 2 areas was offset by a year-on-year decline in Play revenues, reflecting a slowdown in buyer spend due to a number of factors, including lower engagement levels in gaming compared with earlier stages of the pandemic. In terms of costs within Google Services, TAC was $11.8 billion, up 3%. Google Services operating income was $19.8 billion, down 17% and the operating margin was 32%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $6.9 billion for the second quarter, up 38%. GCP's revenue growth was again greater than Cloud's, reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $699 million. As to our Other Bets for the third quarter, revenues were $209 million and the operating loss was $1.6 billion. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. Our results in the third quarter reflect an increased headwind from foreign exchange, given the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus last year. Excluding the revenue benefit from hedging, there was a 6-point headwind year-on-year or 5 points with the hedge benefit compared with a slight tailwind in the third quarter of 2021. Looking to the fourth quarter, based on strengthening of the U.S. dollar quarter-to-date, we expect an even larger headwind from foreign exchange. In addition, as we have previously said, the impact of foreign exchange is greater on operating income than it is on revenues, given that our expense base is weighted more toward the U.S. with most of our R&D efforts located here. Turning to our segment results. Within the Google Services segment, Search and other revenues had healthy fundamental growth in the third quarter, which was affected by the impact of currency movements. As I already noted, the largest driver of the deceleration in year-on-year growth of Search compared with 3Q '21 was lapping the outsized growth in 2021. The sequential deceleration in the year-on-year growth of Search in the third quarter versus the second quarter was also driven by lapping with an additional headwind from pullback in advertiser spend in some areas. In YouTube and Network, the sequential deceleration of year-on-year growth in the third quarter versus the second quarter primarily reflects further pullbacks in advertiser spend. In the fourth quarter, the very strong revenue performance last year will continue to create tough comps that will weigh on the year-on-year growth rates of advertising revenues. Within other revenues, we expect an ongoing headwind from the slowdown in buyer spend on Google Play due to a number of factors, including lower levels of user engagement in gaming that impacted results in the second and third quarters. As Philipp mentioned, among other factors, this shift in user behavior was also a headwind to advertising revenues, with lower revenues from app promo spend on YouTube, Network and Play ads in Search and other. Turning to Google Cloud. Our results reflect momentum across GCP and Workspace. Customers globally are adopting our products and services to digitally transform their businesses. We are excited about the opportunity, given that businesses and governments are still in the early days of public cloud adoption and we continue to invest accordingly. We remain focused on the longer-term path to profitability. In terms of profitability, we have an effort underway to ensure we redeploy investments against our most compelling opportunities. As we noted on our second quarter call, our actions to slow the pace of hiring will become more apparent in 2023. With respect to Alphabet headcount, we added 12,765 people in the third quarter, including more than 2,600 of those joining Google Cloud as part of our acquisition of Mandiant. As in prior quarters, the majority of hires were for technical roles. In the fourth quarter, we expect headcount additions will slow to less than half the number added in Q3. Within this slower headcount growth, next year, we will continue hiring for critical roles, particularly focused on top engineering and technical talent. Turning to CapEx, we continue to make significant investments in technical infrastructure with servers as the largest component. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Maybe 2 questions, if I can. Sundar, first, I think what investors are very curious about is how much this change in terms of aligning investment against your priorities is a reflection of what you expect to happen over the next 6 to 12 months in the broader macro environment versus a longer-term perspective of maybe maximizing for productivity and efficiency. Would love to get your philosophy on that. And then Philipp, a lot of comments in there about YouTube and the potential for growth going forward. Can you go a little bit deeper on what you're seeing in terms of both the opportunity set to drive revenue and turn a possible headwind to a tailwind with respect to Shorts and Connected TV over the medium to long term. Sundar Pichai : Look, I would say it's a combination. Obviously, as a company, over time, we've had periods of extraordinary growth, and then there are periods where I viewed it as a moment where you take the time to optimize the company to make sure we are set up for the next decade of growth ahead. I view this as one of those moments. It gives us a chance to make sure we are, with clarity, identifying what are the most important areas and making sure we are directing our incremental investments towards those and as well as where we can realign. So I view this as an opportunity to do that and also being responsive to the current macro environment we are seeing. Philipp Schindler : Yes. And from my side, Eric, in the third quarter, as I mentioned, there was a further pullback in spend by some advertisers across both brand and direct response. But overall, I feel YouTube remains in a really good position to continue to benefit from the streaming boom. In direct response, we think there's a lot of room to run to make really YouTube more shoppable, more actionable from video action campaigns to product feeds, app campaigns, live commerce features. Advertisers are turning to YouTube to convert intent into action and really drive performance at scale. Product feeds are coming to Discovery ads soon and recent expanded to Shorts. We're already seeing results. And in fact, on average, video action campaigns with product feeds saw an over 70% increase in conversions on Shorts versus those without. On the brand side, as I said earlier, eyeballs are moving away from linear TV, and we're helping brands move beyond traditional. Let's -- to efficiently really achieve their reach and awareness goals. And obviously, you mentioned that as well, Connected TV is an important part of this strategy. When you think about it, YouTube is really the best place for advertisers to reach new consumers across multiple formats and screens from shorts to long-form, podcast, music all the way to CTV. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have 2. The first 1 for Sundar or Ruth. Sundar, just to go back to the comment about earlier in the quarter, becoming 20% more efficient. I thought tonight, your comment on investing responsibly over the long term, about being responsive to the environment is helpful. But if I look at sort of the Excel sheet, I think you'll have added about 51,000 new people to the company since the start of last year. Can you give us some examples of internal KPIs or quantifiable analysis you're running just to ensure you're generating ROI for investors from all your hiring. Just sort of run through these analyses? That's the first one. Then the second one, Philipp, just on Shorts, are you seeing Shorts lead to incremental time spent from those users? Or is it more so you're seeing the time shift from other forms of YouTube over to Shorts? Sundar Pichai : Brian, I think, look, I think we gave some -- we've been clear that we are going to moderate our pace of hiring going into Q4 as well as 2023. I think we are seeing a lot of opportunities across a whole set of areas. And every time, talent is the most precious resource, so we are constantly working to make sure everyone we've brought in is working on the most important things as a company and particularly so. And that's a lot of what sharpening our focus has been about. We are reviewing projects at all scales pretty granularly to make sure we have the right plans there, and based on that, the right resourcing and making course corrections. And this will be an ongoing thing. It is something we'll continue doing going into '23 as well. Philipp Schindler : Yes. And to the second part of the question, as we discussed before, we've always focused on building a great user and creator experience first, followed by increasing monetization over time. We continued to experience a slight headwind to revenues as Shorts viewership grew as a percentage of total YouTube watch time. And as I alluded to earlier, the initial progress on Shorts monetization has been encouraging. And we're focused on closing the monetization gap between Shorts and long-form content on YouTube over time. And more specifically, consumers are increasingly consuming short-form video, and we're seeing this across multiple platforms, including YouTube. And as I said earlier, Shorts are being watched by 1.5 billion-plus logged-in users every month. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : Ruth, you highlighted momentum in Cloud and growth accelerated in 3Q. Are you seeing any changes in Cloud demand as existing or potential customers perhaps rethink their priorities? And then how should we think about the pace of investments at Cloud going forward? Do you still believe that you're in more catch-up mode? Or should we expect a more stable rate of investment and greater profit improvement? Ruth Porat : Thanks for the question. Yes, we are pleased with the ongoing momentum. It's across a wide range of industries and geographies. And it really comes back to the team's focus on helping them solve unique business issues and innovate in new areas as they digitally transform. I think more to your question, and we talked about this about last quarter, in some cases, certain customers are taking longer to decide, and some have committed to deals with shorter terms or smaller deal sizes, which we attribute to a more challenging macro environment. Some are impacted due to reasons that are specific to their business.  But overall, as you can see from the results here again, we're pleased with the momentum in Cloud and do continue to be excited about the long-term opportunities. So that's why I made the comment that we do continue to invest meaningfully in this business. We're still focused very much so on the path to profitability and free cash flow strength here, but we are continuing to invest in the business. And this fits within Sundar's overall comments as we're looking at how we prioritize. And they're certainly making sure they're focused on every element within their business. But fundamentally, to the heart of your question, we're continuing to invest here. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Michael Nathanson : Sundar, I have one for you and then one for you, Ruth. I want to ask you about TikTok but not as it relates to YouTube, more about Search. It looks like younger consumers are spending more time on TikTok searching for product reviews, recommendations, advice. I'm interested in learning if you've seen any changes in your search behavior by demographics in Google. And then do you think search has become more visual and less text-based going forward in order to maintain more relevance for its younger users? So that's one. And then Ruth, can you kind of just dig in a bit on the OpEx growth in Google Services. You called out other cost of revenues being up 20%. It looks like as a percentage of revenues, it's nearly an all-time high. Can you talk a bit about how much of that cost base is fixed versus variable? And anything on outlook on what's driving kind of the spike this quarter and maybe what you expect going forward there on the cost of revenues? Sundar Pichai : Look, I think it's always important that we try and understand our user segments and their needs so that we can make sure the products are helpful and working for them. And we also conduct thousands of studies a year to understand how user needs are evolving. And as part of it, there are some studies which obviously show people, particularly younger users in certain categories, maybe fashion inspiration as an example, look for more visual ways to engage.  And so these are all learnings we are constantly taking in and we use it to improve Search. And if you saw Search On, we had many explorations and product directions, which move in that direction. So I think it's a healthy way of iterating and innovating to build the best products and services for our users. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of your question regarding margins, 2 parts really. On other cost revenues, the biggest driver of the year-on-year increase in other cost of revenues does continue to be data centers and other operations. The change really here this quarter in Q3, the second largest driver was hardware. And then CAC moved from its usual #2 spot down to #3. And there were really 2 key factors for the change in the rank order between hardware and CAC. Probably pretty self-evident but just to spell them out, the year-on-year decline in YouTube Ads revenues obviously muted the growth in CAC. And then the growth of Pixel Phone sales due primarily to the launch of Pixel 6A drove that shift. What we're looking at overall sort of to your broader question about profitability in Google Services is the overall pace of investments. And now we're looking at how with the change -- mix change and ongoing opportunities to drive revenue growth and how it flows through all the way to op inc growth. And so to Sundar's opening comments and as we've been talking about, some of the margin upside last year was due to timing issues with a very strong growth of revenues and there was a lag in investments. And what we're focused on here is how do we continue to manage on a go-forward basis to deliver durable long-term results. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler of Barclays. Ross Sandler : Hate to beat the dead horse on the Google Services margin, but Ruth, you just mentioned mix shift. I think that's a lot of what's going on here. And given the trajectory that you're seeing in Search and in Play, which we estimate are where most of the profit's coming from in that segment versus some of those lower-margin items, YouTube subscription, hardware, et cetera, maybe you could help frame the next like couple of years. Is this going to land below pre pandemic, which I think was around where we are here at 32%? Could we see the 2Q '20 low of 27% for Google Services margin? Any help just framing where that might land would be helpful. Ruth Porat : Well, I'll, as I'm sure you would expect, leave the modeling to you, but there are 2 elements of it. And I think Sundar and Philipp really talked about the first part, which is the ongoing opportunity we see with Search, with YouTube, with some of the actions that we're taking, the opportunity with AI applied to both, the opportunity as we continue to build-out monetization on YouTube Shorts in particular. So we're continuing to focus on both, the driver here, revenue, as well as the investments that we're making. And I want to make sure, to Sundar's comments about sharpening our focus, that we are economizing, utilizing resources as effectively as possible. So it is both the efforts we're taking around expense management and building for durable performance as well as the efforts we're taking, which are in the investment line but drive top line performance. I would say we also contextualize it and I tried to do that in response to Michael's questions. And we said this last year, we've noted that some of the margin upside last year was due to timing issues. And we had a very strong growth in revenues, surge in revenues and a lag in investments that we said was a timing difference, and you are seeing some of that here. But to the main point, we're looking at both what we can do to continue to support long-term revenue growth, but while doing so, being mindful of the pace of investment. I'll leave the modeling to you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Brent Thill : Ruth, on the pullback by some advertisers, is there a common thread that you can draw on common underlying characteristics that are pulling back versus those that are continuing to lean forward? Can you talk about that dynamic and what you're seeing? Ruth Porat : Why don't I start and then I'll pass it to Philipp for a bit more color potentially? Because I want to make sure that one of the comments that we made in the opening comments was very clear, which was the year-on-year story in Ads was really lapping the very strong third quarter. And so to get to your question, you're really talking about sequential decline in our year-on-year growth. I think what's notable in Search, we had really healthy growth in Q3, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The sequential deceleration in Search in the third quarter versus the second quarter was again primarily driven by lapping, and just I want to make sure that, that was clear. There was some pullback from advertiser spend in some areas so I've noted that in opening comments. And then in YouTube and Network, the sequential deceleration of year-on-year growth in both the second quarter -- the third quarter versus the second quarter was really further pullbacks in advertiser spend. Philipp Schindler : Yes, that's exactly right. And as I said earlier, in Search and other ads revenues, while lapping the outsized performance was the largest factor in Q3, we did see some advertiser pull back in certain areas in search ads. And I think the example I called out was in financial services, in the areas of insurance, loan, mortgage, crypto subcategories. And we also noted a pullback in spend by some advertisers on YouTube and Network. And these pullbacks in spend increased in the third quarter. And we also noted lower revenues from AppPromo spend on YouTube and Network. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI. Apologies, we'll need to go to the next question that comes from Maria Ripps of Canaccord. [Technical Difficulty] Ruth Porat : We're holding to see if there are technical difficulties. Thank you, all. And if the operator could keep us posted here, maybe even trying to -- yes. Operator : Again, our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI. Mark Stephen Mahaney : Just checking. Can you hear me? Ruth Porat : We can hear you, Mark. Thank you. Mark Stephen Mahaney : Okay. Two questions, please. One, Sundar, you've been with the company for a long time. You've seen these cycles before. Can you put any context as to the -- as economic conditions wax and wane, the impact that has on Google? Like how does this environment look to you versus prior cycles that the company has managed through? And then Ruth, on the cost side, I understand the comments. I understand the comments about the headcount adds and what you plan to do in the fourth quarter. But could you talk about non-headcount-related costs and the opportunity you see or the need you see for managing those down? And do you see that there are significant opportunities to do that as well. So again, non-headcount costs. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Mark. Well, a couple of things. I think compared to the past, I think are going through this, I mean there is, as we have said before, there is more uncertainty as we go through. We definitely see indicators on both sides so that makes it a bit more unique. Number two, I would say the strength of Search both as a product for users as well as for advertisers in terms of delivering ROI through a tough time in the ad market, I think, is great to see.  Third, just like when we went through it last time, ahead of us was a decade of mobile and the opportunities it brought. And to me, sitting now, looking at all the work that's going on in AI, we've been an AI-first company for the past 7 years in all the investments. And it looks like a big opportunity ahead. So keeping all that in mind, focused on the long term, using this moment to be disciplined and prioritize and focus, I think, will set us up well for the next decade ahead. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of your second question, I think the core to Sundar's comment is with the rapid pace of growth that we've experienced, we see opportunities to focus more. And that drives opportunities to redeploy amazing talent we have into the highest priority efforts that we have and to be as effective and efficient as possible. There are, obviously, to your question, non-payroll-associated expenses that also then attach. And so an operating environment like this adds urgency to prioritization. We want to make sure we're using all resources as effectively and efficiently as possible. At the same time, as we've tried to be very clear, there are very exciting areas that we will continue to invest in. And so part of this is resource optimization, constraint optimization, however you want to describe it. We want to free up where we can to ensure we have capacity to invest as needed in opportunities that deliver these durable long-term results that we've talked about. And so we're trying to be smart about redeploying where we can, finding efficiencies where we can while still investing for long-term growth. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Maria Ripps of Canaccord. Maria Ripps : First, you talked about strength in retail and travel. Can you maybe talk about automotive advertising and whether you're seeing any signs of recovery as supply has been normalizing? And if so, how might this rebound sort of compared to prior cycles? And then secondly, just on Performance Max, it seems like it continues to do pretty well here. So based on your conversations with advertisers, are there any specific features or functionality that you would call out as significant drivers of the product attractiveness? And is there any color you can add maybe around relative ROI of PMax? Philipp Schindler : Yes. So there's really no additional color. Thank you very much for your question, but there's really no additional color on other verticals apart from the ones I mentioned already that I think we should share here at this moment. On the Performance Max side, we've touched on earlier and in prior quarters and just as a little reminder, it's our fully automated Google Ads campaign tied with the most channel and inventory coverage, that really helps advertisers deliver a better ROI. And we've been listening to feedback from advertisers and have continued to roll out more features since its initial launch to increase transparency and help advertisers steer the automation more effectively. And there are more future updates to come. In July, we launched a number of new settings, including seasonality setting that lets marketers make quite typical adjustments for seasonal campaign bidding and an optimization score setting that gives an indicator for performance improvement and gives the recommendations for better results. So all in all, we're excited about what's ahead for PMax, the further simplification of our products in general, and frankly, the value we can keep driving for business of all sizes, especially when they need it most. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Justin Post : I guess a follow-up about artificial intelligence. First, CapEx is up 31% year-over-year. Can you talk about a little bit what's driving that and can that be pulled back a bit? Is that Cloud or really building out the AI capabilities? And then maybe, Sundar, as you think about Search where it is today and you have much better visibility on AI capabilities than we do, how could some of those capabilities be mixed into Search? And when would we as investors maybe see some of those benefits? Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Justin. Look, I mean, I think on the AI front, we are still in very early innings. We've been very good about, as our research teams are making progress, bringing it into Search so pretty much transformer-based models, including BERT and MUM and Search now. So it's driven a massive improvement in search quality and helped us extend the lead in quality over other products. We are definitely using it to make it multimodal. And I think going back to some of the earlier questions about making sure Search is visual, things like Google Lens bringing visual search into -- being able to point your phone at things and ask questions, all that really helps set up Search well for the future of where computing is headed. But AI not only affects search, it affects all our products. It makes YouTube better, ads better -- and through Cloud, we are bringing it to other companies as well. So we'll keep that in mind. And maybe to -- so we'll keep that in mind. Justin Post : And then maybe, Ruth, on the CapEx, where is most of that going to and how do you think about that going forward? Ruth Porat : The majority of CapEx does continue to be for our technical infrastructure. And as we've talked about on prior calls, servers really has been the largest driver of the investment dollars. The technical infrastructure team has consistently focused on levers to improve utilization and efficiency and they continue to do so. We are investing, to Sundar's comments, in building out the compute in support of all that we're doing with our AI teams and are excited about that. And obviously, you had seen some more activity earlier in the year regarding real estate. We feel good about where we are. We're continuing to fit out our offices, et cetera, for utilization in this new return to hybrid work environment, but we're trying to make sure that we're doing that at an appropriate measured pace, and that's really it. Thank you very much. Operator : That concludes our Q&A session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Jim Friedland for closing remarks. James Friedland : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter 2022 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. James Friedland : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor.  Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC, including our upcoming Form 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2022. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise.  And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. It's clear that after a period of significant acceleration in digital spending during the pandemic, the macroeconomic climate has become more challenging. We continue to have an extraordinary business and provide immensely valuable services for people and our partners. For example, during the World Cup final on December 18, Google Search saw its highest query per second volume of all time. And beyond our advertising business, we have strong momentum in Cloud, YouTube subscriptions and hardware.  However, our revenues this quarter were impacted by pullbacks in advertiser spend and the impact of foreign exchange. I'll focus on 2 major things today in a bit more detail, and then I'll give a shorter-than-usual quarterly snapshot from across our business. First, how we unlock the incredible opportunities AI enables for consumers, our partners and for our business; and second, how we focus our investments and make necessary decisions as a company to get there.  First, the AI opportunity ahead. AI is the most profound technology we are working on today. Our talented researchers, infrastructure and technology make us extremely well positioned as AI reaches an inflection point. More than 6 years ago, I first spoke about Google being an AI-first company. Since then, we have been a leader in developing AI. In fact, our Transformer research project and our field-defining paper in 2017 as well as our path-breaking work in diffusion models are now the basis of many of the generative AI applications you're starting to see today.  Translating these kinds of technical leaps into products that help billions of people is what our company has always strived on. Everyone working on the various projects underway is excited. We'll pursue this work boldly but with a deep sense of responsibility with our AI principles and the highest standards of information integrity at the core of all our work.  We have been preparing for this moment since early last year, and you're going to see a lot from us in the coming few months across 3 big areas of opportunity. First, large models, we published extensively about LaMDA and PaLM, the industry's largest, most sophisticated model plus extensive work at DeepMind. In the coming weeks and months, we'll make these language models available, starting with LaMDA so that people can engage directly with them. This will help us continue to get feedback, test and safely improve them. These models are particularly amazing for composing, constructing and summarizing. They will become even more useful for people as they provide up-to-date more factual information. And in Search, language models like BERT and MUM have improved searches for 4 years now, enabling significant ranking improvements and multimodal search like Google Lens. Very soon, people will be able to interact directly with our newest, most powerful language models as a companion to Search in experimental and innovative ways. Stay tuned. Second, we'll provide new tools and APIs for developers, creators and partners. This will empower them to innovate and build their own applications and discover new possibilities with AI on top of our language, multimodal and other AI models. Third, our AI is a powerful enabler for businesses and organizations of all sizes, and we have much more to come here.  There's a few flavors of this. Google Cloud is making our technological leadership in AI available to customers via our Cloud AI platform, including infrastructure and tools for developers and data scientists like Vertex AI. We also offer specific AI solutions for sectors like manufacturing, life sciences and retail and will continue to roll out more. Workspace users benefit from AI-powered features like Smart Canvas for collaboration and Smart Compose for creation. And we are working to bring large language models to Gmail and Docs. We'll also make available other helpful generative capabilities from coding to design and more.  And for our advertising partners, Philipp will discuss in detail how AI is powering dramatic campaign improvements and value-adding features for them. Of course, in addition to all this, AI also continues to improve Google's other products dramatically. And we'll continue our work with others outside Google, including joint research collaborations to develop AI responsibly and to apply AI to tackle society's greatest challenges and opportunities.  For example, DeepMind's protein database of all 200 million proteins known to science have now been used by 1 million biologists around the world. We continue to invest in AI across the board, and Google AI and DeepMind are integral to a bright AI-first future. Over the past few years, DeepMind has been increasingly working across groups within Google and the Other Bets And to reflect that progress, we'll be making a financial reporting change that Ruth will share more about in her comments. We are just at the beginning of our AI journey, and the best is yet to come.  The second thing I wanted to discuss is our sharpened focus. We are committed to investing responsibly with great discipline and defining areas where we can operate more cost effectively. We are focused on methodically building financially sustainable, vibrant growing businesses across Alphabet. For example, we are working to improve the economics and hardware as we focus more intently on the Pixel line and our overall cost structure there. Cloud remains very focused on its path to profitability. And there are many opportunities to build on our progress at YouTube over the years, starting with Shorts monetization. Overall, I see this as an important journey to reengineer the company's cost base in a durable way. There are several dimensions already underway, including prioritization of our product investments across Google and Other Bets. It also includes a careful focus on our hiring needs, reflecting these priorities as well as efficiencies in our technical infrastructure and productivity improvements from our AI tools. As part of this, we did a rigorous review across product areas and functions to ensure that our people and roles are aligned with our highest priorities as a company and we announced a reduction in our workforce. I'm grateful to the Googlers leaving us for all of their contributions and their hard work to help people and businesses everywhere.  Let me give a few quick updates from across the business this quarter. Just this week, we started bringing revenue sharing to YouTube Shorts, which is now averaging over 50 billion daily views, up from the 30 billion I announced on the Q1 2022 call. This will reward creators and help improve the Shorts experience for everyone. Our subscription business continues to grow, with YouTube Music and Premium surpassing 80 million subscribers, including trialers. Together with YouTube Primetime channel subscriptions and YouTube TV, we have good momentum here. YouTube's NFL Sunday Ticket will accelerate that by helping to drive subscriptions, bring new viewers to YouTube's paid and ad-supported experiences and create new opportunities for creators.  Turning to hardware. Many outlets and reviewers named Pixel 7 Pro the phone of the year. Features like Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur are incredible and help differentiate Pixel from others. 2022's Pixel 6A, 7 and 7 Pro are the best-selling generation of phones we have ever launched, and we gained share in every market we operate in this year.  Next, Google Cloud. We see continued momentum with Q4 revenue growing 32%. Our differentiated products and focused go-to-market strategy continue to drive customer momentum, beginning with real-time data analytics and AI. Customers are increasingly choosing BigQuery because we unify data lakes, data warehouses and advanced AI/ML into 1 system and now analyze over 110 terabytes of data per second. Customers like Kroger can analyze data in multiple clouds without moving data in most cases, and MSCI processes unstructured and structured data at scale.  In infrastructure, our global network and advanced TPU v4 AI supercomputer helped Snap triple the throughput for its business-critical ad ranking workload while significantly lowering cost. Our machine learning infrastructure with Cloud TPU v4 Pods can run large-scale training workloads up to 80% faster than alternatives according to third-party benchmarks, which is helping customers like Bayer accelerate drug discovery. Our reliability advantages and open edge cloud powered the mission-critical 5G network of Telefonica Germany. As I mentioned, our suite of AI/ML solutions across verticals are a key differentiator. We helped Wells Fargo automate the customer service experience for mobile users, and helped [ CA ] continually improve the quality of patient care. In 2022, Mandiant, which we are now integrating, helped over 1,800 customers prepare for or recover from the most critical cybersecurity incidents.  In Workspace, the innovations mentioned earlier are helping drive new wins and expansions across geographies. In Other Bets, from Calico to Waymo, we are focused on investing sustainably across the portfolio and creating good businesses. Verily, for example, has recently honed its strategy and structure to more clearly focus its product development.  To close, we are all standing on the cusp of an era of amazing opportunities. We are going to be bold, responsible and focused as we move into it. A healthy disregard for the impossible has been core to our company culture from the very beginning. When I look around Google today, I see that same spirit and energy driving our efforts. Thanks to our employees, our partners and people everywhere who use our services. I'm excited for what's next. Over to you, Philipp. Philipp Schindler : Thanks, Sundar. Hello, everyone. It's good to be with you all. I'll start today with our Google Services performance in the fourth quarter and then dive deeper into our priority areas. Google Services revenues of $68 billion were down 2% year-on-year, negatively affected by sizable foreign exchange headwind. In Google advertising, Search and Other revenues were down 2% year-over-year, and YouTube Ads and Network had high single-digit revenue declines. Google Other revenues were up 8% year-over-year, with strong growth in YouTube, non-advertising and hardware revenues, offset by a decrease in Play revenues. I'll highlight 2 other factors that affected our Ads business in Q4. Ruth will provide more detail. In Search and Other, revenues grew moderately year-over-year, excluding the impact of FX, reflecting an increase in retail and travel, offset partially by a decline in finance. At the same time, we saw further pullback in spend by some advertisers in Search in Q4 versus Q3. In YouTube and Network, the year-over-year revenue declines were due to a broadening of pullbacks in advertiser spend in the fourth quarter. I'll now zoom out to share more broadly where we're investing and see clear opportunities for long-term growth. First, Google AI. It's important to recognize that our advertising business has obviously benefited over the past decade from the transition to mobile. More recently, we had outsized growth in advertising revenues during the pandemic, with 2022 advertising revenues $90 billion higher than in 2019. Going forward, we are focused on growing revenues on top of this higher base through AI-driven innovation. Sundar highlighted the incredible opportunities underway with AI and the transformative impact it will have on businesses. Already, breakthroughs in everything from natural language understanding to generative AI are fueling our ability to deliver results that drive meaningful performance for advertisers and are useful to users. Take Smart Bidding, which uses AI to predict future ad conversions and their value, helping businesses stay agile and responsive to rapid shifts in demand.  In 2022, AI advances boosted bidding performance, allowing us to move advertiser outcomes down the funnel to drive better ROI and use budgets more efficiently. In search query matching, large language models like MUM matched advertiser offers to user queries. This understanding of human intent of language, combined with advances in bidding prediction, are why businesses can see an average of 35% more conversions when they upgrade exact match keywords to broad match in campaigns that use a target CPA.  Google AI also underlies our creative products like tech suggestions in Google ads and creative optimization and responsive search ads. We're excited to start testing our automatically created assets beta, which uses AI to generate headlines and descriptions for search created seamlessly once advertisers opt in. Then of course, there's Performance Max, which offers the best combination of our AI-powered systems to our customers. But we're not stopping here, and these examples aren't exhaustive. AI has been foundational to our ads business for the last decade, and we'll continue to bring cutting-edge advances to our products to help businesses and users.  Number two, retail. Our foundation for delivering value over the long term includes 3 pillars. First, we are on a multiyear mission to make Google a core part of shopping journeys for consumers and a valuable place for merchants to connect with users. This means constantly improving our consumer experiences, starting with a more visual, immersive, browsable search. Second, we're empowering more merchants to participate in our free listings and ad experiences. In 2022, we saw an uptick in merchants, particularly SMBs and product inventory, coming on to Google. Adding more value for merchants remains a top priority.  Third, to drive retail performance further, we focus on great ads products, from automation and insights to bidding tools and omnichannel solutions to AI-powered campaigns like PMax. We're helping retailers hit their goals and connect with customers no matter where or when they shop. Two quick insights on PMax, which we upgraded the majority of advertisers to from Smart Shopping Campaigns last year. First, advertisers on average see a 12% uplift from SSC to PMax. Second, it was a success story during the holidays and Cyber 5. Its ability to scale and adapt to changing traffic over a volatile peak retail season drove strong results for many retailers, particularly mid-market advertisers.  Moving on to YouTube. Despite ongoing revenue headwinds in Q4, we're confident in YouTube's long-term trajectory. Here's how we think about our strategy. It all starts with a creator ecosystem. Creators are the lifeblood of YouTube. In 2022, more people created content on YouTube than ever before, long-form, short-form, audio, podcast, music, live streams, what sets YouTube apart is we give creators more ways to create content and connect with fans and more ways to earn money than any other platform. More creators means more content, means more viewers, which leads to more opportunities for advertisers.  The creator ecosystem and our multi-format strategy will continue to drive YouTube's long-term growth. And to support that growth, we're focused on : number one, ramping Shorts; number two, accelerating engagement on large screen; number three, investing in our subscription offerings; and number four, a long-term effort to make YouTube more shoppable.  First, Shorts. Viewership is growing rapidly, as Sundar said, 50 billion-plus daily views. We're also still pleased with our continuing progress in early monetization. On the creator side, it's been impressive to see the innovative ways creators are using Shorts to introduce their content and extend existing channels. We're focused on providing creators with the best content creation and monetization tools, new, richer features and analytics capabilities that help individualize and optimize their content strategies. It's early days for Shorts but we're confident the runway is long.  Next, connected TV, where users are increasingly watching their favorite creators on the big screen at home. According to Nielsen, YouTube is the leader in U.S. streaming watch time. Advertisers are leaning in. With AI-powered solutions, we're helping brands deliver efficient reach and ROI and address pain points like frequency and measurement. Then there's our subscription offerings. It's clear the future of online video is about helping users seamlessly discover and watch content across ad-supported and premium services. Our goal is to be a one-stop shop for multiple types of video content. That's why we first offered YouTube Music and Premium, where 80 million-plus paid subscribers and trialers enjoy their favorite content and music ads-free.  We then expanded into YouTube TV, significantly improving on the legacy television experience. And then last fall, Primetime Channels launched, making streaming subscription services available on YouTube on an ala carte basis. Given the potential we see in our subscription offerings, we recently announced a multiyear agreement to distribute NFL Sunday Ticket. As Sundar highlighted, we're excited about the opportunities this will open up.  Lastly is our focus on shoppable YouTube. It's still nascent, but we see lots of potential on making it easier for people to shop from the creators, brands and content they love.  I'll close with something I've said many times before. Our success is only possible because of our customers and partners. The reality is we only do well when they do well. Since our earliest days, our revenue share models have been structured around ROI for our partners, from Play developers and online publishers to YouTube creators, artists and media orgs around the world. Over the last 3 years, I'm proud to share that we've contributed more than $200 billion to these ecosystems. We remain as committed as ever to fueling the next generation of businesses, media companies and creativity on the web. On that note, a big thank you to our partners and customers for their ongoing collaboration and trust, and to Googlers for their energy, focus and dedication to helping our users, customers and partners succeed, especially through these tougher times.  Ruth, over to you. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Philipp. For the full year 2022, Alphabet delivered revenues of $283 billion, up 10% versus 2021 and up 14% on a constant currency basis, adding $37 billion to revenues, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. I will briefly cover the main points of our fourth quarter results and then turn to our outlook to give you more context for Sundar's comments on how we're focused on investing for growth as well as on reengineering our cost base for long-term success. For the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenues were $76 billion, up 1% or up 7% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Our total cost of revenues was $35.3 billion, up 7%. Other cost of revenues of $22.4 billion were up 15%. The increase was driven by 2 factors. First, hardware costs due primarily to $1.2 billion in inventory-related charges, and secondarily, to strong unit sales. The charges reflect ongoing pricing pressures and changes in expected future inventory needs.  Second, costs associated with data centers and other operations. Operating expenses were $22.5 billion, up 10%, reflecting an increase in R&D expenses, primarily driven by headcount growth, followed by an increase in G&A expenses, primarily reflecting an increase in charges related to accrued legal matters. These increases were partially offset by a decline in sales and marketing expenses primarily due to lower advertising and promotional spend. Operating income was $18.2 billion, down 17% versus last year, and our operating margin was 24%. Net income was $13.6 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $16 billion in the fourth quarter and $60 billion in 2022. We ended the year with $114 billion in cash and marketable securities. We also repurchased a total of $59 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in 2022. Turning to our segment results, starting with Google Services. Revenues were $67.8 billion, down 2%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $42.6 billion in the quarter were down 2%. Search delivered moderate underlying growth in Q4, absent the impact of currency movements on reported results. YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion were down 8%. Network advertising revenues of $8.5 billion were down 9%.  Other revenues were $8.8 billion, up 8%, reflecting several factors : first, significant subscriber growth in YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV; second, strong growth in hardware revenues, primarily from the Pixel family. Offsetting growth in these 2 areas was a year-on-year decline in Play revenues, reflecting a particularly large foreign exchange headwind in APAC as well as the impact of reductions of Play Store fees. TAC was $12.9 billion, down 4%. Google Services operating income was $21.1 billion, down 19%. And the operating margin was 31%.  Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $7.3 billion for the quarter, up 32%. Revenue growth in GCP was again greater than Google Cloud, reflecting strength in both infrastructure and platform services. Google Workspace's strong results were driven by increases in both seats and average revenue per seat. In Q4, we saw slower growth of consumption as customers optimized GCP costs, reflecting the macro backdrop. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $480 million. As to our Other Bets, for the full year 2022, revenues were $1.1 billion, and the operating loss was $6.1 billion.  Turning to our outlook for the business. In 2022, our year-on-year revenue growth was affected by a number of challenges. First, we faced very tough comps, given the outsized recovery in 2021 from the impact of the pandemic. Second, foreign exchange headwinds grew throughout the year. And third, we were operating against the backdrop of a more challenging economic climate that also impacted many of our customers and which remains ongoing.  Within Google Services, we are focused on investing in the opportunities we see for long-term revenue growth. First, within advertising, we are focused on using advances in AI to drive new and better experiences for users and search as well as to deliver better measurement, higher ROI and tools for more compelling creative content to advertisers. In YouTube, we are prioritizing continued growth in Shorts engagement and monetization while also working on other initiatives across our ad-supported products.  As to our outlook for other revenues, in Play, 2022 results reflected the particularly sizable impact from foreign exchange, lapping the uplift in user activity during the pandemic and the impact from the fee reductions we introduced. We remain optimistic about the longer-term prospects for mobile apps and gaming although remain more cautious near term, given industry trends.  With YouTube subscriptions, we're optimistic about building on its momentum across YouTube Music Premium, YouTube TV and Primetime Channels. In hardware, we continue to make sizable investments particularly to support innovation across our Pixel family while working to drive greater focus and cost efficiencies across the portfolio. For Google Cloud, we remain excited about the long-term market opportunity and the trajectory of the business. Enterprises and governments are increasingly turning to us for their digital transformation initiatives across verticals and geographies. While investing for growth, we remain very focused on Google Cloud's path to profitability. In terms of Other Bets, as Sundar mentioned, we will be making a financial reporting change as it relates to DeepMind. To reflect the increasing DeepMind collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets, beginning in the first quarter, DeepMind will no longer be reported in Other Bets and will be reported as part of Alphabet's corporate costs. I'll now walk you through the key elements of our efforts to deliver a durable reengineering of our cost base in order to slow the pace of operating expense growth. We expect the impact will become more visible in 2024. First, with respect to Alphabet headcount, we are meaningfully slowing the pace of hiring in 2023 while still investing in priority areas. In Q4, we added 3,455 people. As in prior quarters, the majority of hires were for technical roles. With respect to our recent announcement that we are reducing our workforce by approximately 12,000 roles, most of the impact will be seen in Q1. We will take a severance charge of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, which will be reported in corporate costs. We will continue hiring in priority areas with a particular focus on top engineering and technical talent as well as on the global footprint of our talent.  Second, we have a longer-term effort underway to reengineer our cost base in 3 broad categories : first, using AI and automation to improve productivity across Alphabet for operational tasks as well as the efficiency of our technical infrastructure; second, managing our spend with suppliers and vendors more effectively; and third, optimizing how and where we work. In the first quarter of 2023, we expect to incur approximately $500 million of costs related to exiting leases to align our office space with our adjusted global headcount look. This will be reflected in corporate costs. We will continue to optimize our real estate footprint.  Turning to CapEx. For 2023, we expect total CapEx to be generally in line with 2022, with an increase in technical infrastructure versus a decline in office facilities. Our ongoing investment in technical infrastructure is obviously a critical component of supporting our long-term growth opportunities. Finally, I will point you to our earnings release in which we noted that we adjusted the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment starting in Q1 '23. We expect these changes will favorably impact our 2023 operating results by approximately $3.4 billion for assets and service as of year-end 2022. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have 2. The first one around AI and sort of the cost of AI. I appreciate all the color about all the AI tools that are to come. I guess, first question is, how should we think about the potential impact on CapEx, and the higher compute intensity of these AI tools to come potentially impacting margins over the next couple of years? And then the second one, Ruth, I really appreciate the conversation about long-term efforts underway to improve efficiency. How should we think about potential impacts of those efforts in '23 and in '24? Have you sort of run any sizes of what types of savings we could see roll through the P&L over that period? Ruth Porat : Thanks for the question. So starting on your question about AI and CapEx. As I think Sundar and Philipp both noted, AI is already incorporated in many of our products, products like Performance Max and Smart Bidding and Cloud, as Sundar said. It is more compute-intensive but also opens up many more services and products for our users, for creators, for advertisers.  That being said, we're very focused on further optimizing the cost of compute, and that's across all elements, data center, servers and our supply chain. So we're continuing to invest with a keen lens on the return on that capital. And as I indicated in opening comments, when we look at CapEx for 2023, we do expect it's going to be generally in line with 2022 with an important mix shift. We're increasing our investments in technical infrastructure. And that's not just for AI. That's to support investments across Alphabet, in particular in Cloud as well. And at the same time, we're meaningfully decreasing our CapEx for office facilities. And then with respect to the overall efficiency opportunities, yes, very keen focus on the 3 areas that I noted, and one of the key elements of it is using AI and automation to improve productivity and efficiency of our technical infrastructure. We noted that we want to be focused and that we are focused on durable improvements to our expense base. And that's because if you go through the items, the work streams that we have in flight, they take longer to implement, execute. They're in process now, and they continue to build on themselves and continue to provide added upside as we go through time, which is why I indicated you would see more of an impact on 2024 than in 2023. But we're continuing to work through them. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with Nathanson (sic) [ MoffettNathanson ]. Michael Nathanson : I have 2. For Sundar and Philipp, you both mentioned the NFL in your remarks and the opportunities it opens up. Can you comment and help us define what do you see is that longer-term opportunity? Why is it so critical to have the NFL? Is this the first of many sports deals to be had? So anything to just help us why this is so important to you.  And then just, Philipp, you've said in the past about the scaling of monetization, YouTube Shorts. What are the sticky factors? What's taking time to really bring advertisers on? And what are some of the things you've seen in terms that you've solved to make this a more quickly monetizable product? Philipp Schindler : Yes. Thank you so much for the question. We think there is a lot of great opportunities to differentiate the user and creator experience with our unique capabilities. It basically means that every YouTube viewer who is interested in the NFL can now have 1-click access to the full offering of Sunday Ticket as an add-on package on YouTube TV subscription and as a stand-alone offering on Primetime Channels. This will be the first time that Sunday Ticket is actually available a la carte for fans. On YouTube TV, we're building the ability for subscribers to, for example, watch multiple screens at once. And on YouTube CTV, we'll be adding new features specific to the Sunday Ticket experience like comments, chats, polls and so on. On the creator side, imagine all the innovative ways they can create with exclusive NFL content, behind-the-scenes event access and so on. And we're really excited to see what they'll do across long-form, shorts, live streams and more.  On your second question, on the Shorts side, as I said earlier, viewership is growing rapidly, 50 billion-plus daily views, up from 30 billion last spring. We're still pleased with our continuing progress in monetization. Closing the gap between Shorts and long-form is a big priority for us, as is, of course, continuing to build a great creator and user experience, which we're paying a lot of attention to. As on Shorts are now available, it gives you a bit of a sign for the progress. We have video action, app discovery, Performance Max campaigns. And via product feed, Shorts are also shoppable. And again, we're the only destination where creators can produce all forms of content across multiple formats, across multiple screens and really with multiple ways to make a living. And Sundar shared just yesterday, we brought revenue sharing to Shorts via our YouTube Partner Program. Ultimately, our goal is to make YouTube the best place for Shorts and creators. And that's really what our focus is at the moment. Operator : And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : One for Sundar and one for Ruth. For Sundar, can you just talk more about how you can bring the AI products to market with the principles and integrity that you talked about, and how you can do that without kind of sacrificing quality or trust along the way? And then, Ruth, clearly, the language around reengineering the cost structure in a durable way and everything that went along with it is different than what we've heard in the past. Is there any way at all to help us quantify how you're thinking about these efforts? Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Doug. On the AI side, it is a really exciting time. I think we've been investing for a while, and it's clear that the market is ready. Consumers are interested in trying out new experiences. I think I feel comfortable with all the investments we have made in making sure we can develop AI responsibly. And we'll be careful. We'll be launching more as labs products in certain cases, beta features in certain cases and just slowly scaling up from there. Obviously, we need to make sure we are iterating in public, these models will keep getting better so the field is fast changing. The serving costs will need to be improved.  So I view it as very, very early days, but we are committed to putting our experiences, both in terms of new products and experiences, actually bringing direct LLM experiences in Search, making APIs available for developers and enterprises and learn from there and iterate like we've always done. So I'm looking forward to it. Ruth Porat : And then on your second question, when we talk about being focused on delivering sustainable financial value, that obviously means that expense growth cannot be growing ahead of revenue growth. And we're focused on revenue upside as well as durable changes to the expense base to really ensure we have the capacity to invest in that growth. And clearly, the emphasis of revenue growth, there's a lot that's exciting ahead of us within Google Services, all of the AI advancements that are improving advertiser ROI and the search user experience and more broadly, as we've talked about across the key product areas.  And then very importantly, on expense growth, we have a very strong commitment to -- we keep emphasizing durably reengineer our cost base, and that will benefit all of the segments across Alphabet. And the key components, slowing the pace of hiring as a starting point, product prioritization across Google, as Sundar said, is key. Improving economics in hardware as we focus intently on the Pixel line and cost structure, then using AI and automation to improve productivity for operational tasks as well as for the efficiency of our technical infrastructure, where we have a number of work streams. Managing our spend, as I said, with suppliers and vendors and then optimizing how and where we work, and you saw part of that with the real estate consolidation, given the slower headcount growth. All of those not only benefit Google Services but many of those similarly drive greater efficiency across Alphabet. And so as we've said, in Cloud, we remain very focused on the path to profitability. That's a revenue and margin driver. And then with Other Bets, we're similarly focused on investing sustainably. And so to go back to it, it's the durable nature of change in some of the elements that I've talked about here where work is ongoing, you start to see impacting in '23 but to really get full year run rate and the benefit of it, there is work ongoing. And that's why we've emphasized this notion of it comes in and then really you see the run rate in '24. Operator : Our next question is from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Maybe 2, if I could. Sundar, for you, continuing on the AI theme, how do you think philosophically about capturing the opportunity set that you see in front of you, given all the investments you've made over the last 5-plus years that we've been talking about going back to a lot of Google I/Os versus potentially disrupting the user experience or the monetization arc in your existing product set and striking the right balance between the opportunity set and being disruptive to yourself when you think about looking forward over the next couple of years? And then, Ruth, maybe just following on some of the questions and debates on the cost structure. Obviously, Other Bets is an area where the losses continue to be sort of higher than what some of us think from the outside looking in. But then you showed some improvement in the losses in the Cloud division this quarter. How should we be thinking about the rationalization of the cost structure and aligning costs with opportunity sets across some of the divisions of Alphabet when you think for the medium to long term? Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Eric. Look, I do think, first of all, we made such a foundational technology and we've been investing not just in terms of research but actually getting it all production scale-ready. We had already deployed. If you look at the impact, things like BERT and MUM have had on search quality, making search multimodal, driving the usage of products like Google Lens. I feel like we've been scaling up well.  In Google Cloud today with Vertex AI, we'd already been bringing AI APIs to enterprises, and they're on a pretty healthy growth path. So we do see secular opportunities ahead, both in terms of putting these APIs out, making sure every developer, every organization in the world can use it. And as I said earlier, we are in very, very early days, and I think there's a lot of room ahead.  In terms of Search too, now that we can integrate more direct LLM-type experiences in Search, I think it will help us expand and serve new types of use cases, generative use cases. And so I think I see this as a chance to rethink and reimagine and drive Search to solve more use cases for our users as well. So again, early days, you will see us be bold, put things out, get feedback and iterate and make things better. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of your question about Other Bets investment levels, so as we've talked about in prior calls, our goal for Other Bets is to use our deep technology investments to drive innovation with real potential for value creation. And at the same time, we are very focused on the overall pace of investment and the financial returns. And so what we're really looking at here are what are the opportunities for monetization and commercialization. As I've said on prior calls, there is no monolithic approach across the portfolio, but we are very focused on whether -- what's the pace of investment opportunities for monetization and commercialization. And just a bit more with respect to the DeepMind move, to be very clear, we consolidate in Other Bets into Google only when that bet supports products and services within Google or for Alphabet broadly. And you saw us do that some time ago when we moved Chronicle as an example into combining with our Cloud business and really the cybersecurity offering that is now in Cloud, and that was very effective.  With AI, this is obviously an Alphabet strategic priority, and we see huge opportunity ahead, and DeepMind's research is core to that future across the product areas in the Alphabet portfolio. And so this reporting change reflects the strategic focus in DeepMind, the support of each one of our segments, and that's why I indicated that beginning Q1, DeepMind financials will be reported within our corporate cost segment. Operator : Our next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : Just digging into Search kind of low single-digit growth ex FX. Can you talk about the pressures there, volume versus pricing or CPCs? What's really driving the slowdown? It's kind of almost back to '09 recession levels. Just think about that. And then any signs that we're near a bottom? Any stabilization in growth rates you can talk about or how your outlook is for '23 on that? Ruth Porat : So overall, as we've indicated, we remain very excited about all that we're doing in Search, the utility for all of us. And so that's why you've heard so many comments about the application of AI and what that means for the ongoing opportunity. You had a number of different questions in there. I think one was on volumes. In the 10-K that we'll be filing shortly, you'll see that for the full year 2022, CPCs were down 1% versus last year. And as we've talked about in prior quarters, the change in CPCs can reflect a number of different factors : geographic mix, property mix, all sorts of things. Clicks were up 10% in 2022, reflecting a number of factors, including increased engagement, primarily on mobile devices and improvements in ad formats. But I think overall, we're really excited about what we see ahead. We're not going to predict the global environment. We did say the challenging backdrop is ongoing, and you can see that but we're very focused on what we can control. And I think most important and what we're really excited about here is innovation to help advertisers overall and our cost reengineering that really gets us to align this long-term sustainable value creation. Operator : Our next question is from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Ross Sandler : Just a question on the hardware business. Pixel's doing quite well, but it seems like there have been issues around other areas with this inventory write-down. So could maybe you guys just talk about, in your mind, the strategic importance of having the wide range of hardware products that you have in that segment as it relates to your overall AI initiatives? Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Ross. First of all, very, very pleased with how Pixel has performed through a challenging macro environment. Look, I think our computing portfolio is incredibly important. It's what allows us to -- for us to invest and drive innovation forward. You have to put it all together as a product and ship it. And I think it ends up playing a very, very big role in guiding the ecosystem as well.  And increasingly, I think users are thinking beyond phones and thinking through a holistic ecosystem. To give one example, us undertaking Pixel Watch and, as part of that, integrating Fitbit and bringing it to our ecosystem as well, partnering closely with Samsung on wearables. The combination is what has driven over a 300% increase in actives on Android watches ecosystem. So just to give you a context on that.  So we are very thoughtful about how we are approaching this area. And as Ruth mentioned, across all these areas, too, we are working to drive greater focus and cost efficiencies in the portfolio. Obviously, we work through a challenging supply chain environment as well as a challenging environment on the demand side. And so we'll continue focusing on improving all of this in a durable way. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Mark Stephen Mahaney : I'll just ask 1 question on, Ruth, you mentioned a couple of times getting Google Cloud to profitability. And just talk through how that gets done. You had almost 40% growth in Google Cloud. The operating loss level stayed about the same from '21 to '22, so the growth is there. What are the factors that need to be solved in order to get pretty nice profitability out of that segment sort of anywhere akin to what Azure and AWS have been able to show over the years? Ruth Porat : Thanks for the question. So as we've talked about on prior calls, with Google Cloud, we've really been investing ahead of our revenues, given the growth and the opportunity overall and the desire to ensure that we're equipped, able to support customers across segments around the globe. And so there's been meaningful investments to position ourselves to really have the momentum that the team has continued to deliver. That being said, they are, as both Sundar and I have noted, extremely focused on the path to profitability and every element of that. And some of the items that I noted that benefit Alphabet generally most certainly are relevant here for Cloud as well, everything from our efficiency with our technical infrastructure, which we're very excited about, all the efforts that they're doing there and more broadly.  So this has been really to ensure, first and foremost, given the scale of the opportunity and the speed with which it's moving that we're positioned to be present with our customers, to provide them with the analytics, the skills, the capabilities that are needed to build for long-term growth. And we're at a position now where we've meaningfully closed the gap to profitability but still are working through as we continue to invest for growth while narrowing what this is on our march to profitability. Operator : And our last question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill : Ruth, can you give us a sense of what you're seeing in Q1? Is this year a little more seasonal than historic? Are you observing any different patterns just over 1 month into the year? Can you give us any color in terms of how you're framing this quarter? Ruth Porat : So I think as you know well, we don't tend to -- we don't provide exit run rates. What we try to do is give you the context within which we're approaching the overall business and the priorities that we have as we're looking at revenue upside and the growth levers there as well as how to reengineer our expense base to deliver attractive returns. So not really much to add to the comments that you've heard today, and we're continuing to execute across each one of the elements we discussed. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks. James Friedland : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2023 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. James Friedland : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with our business performance in the first quarter, with Search performing well and momentum in Cloud. We introduced important product updates anchored in deep computer science and AI. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users, and we see huge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation. On Cloud, we continue to be on a long and exciting journey to build that business. Cloud delivered profitability this quarter, and we remain focused on long-term value creation here. Today, I'll give an update on the 2 themes I spoke about last quarter : one, our advancements in AI and how they are driving opportunities in Search and beyond; and two, our efforts to sharpen our focus as a company. Then I'll talk about our momentum in Cloud and close with our progress at YouTube. First, the incredible AI opportunity for consumers, our partners and for our business. I've compared it to the successful transition we made from desktop to mobile computing over a decade ago. Our investments and breakthroughs in AI over the last decade have positioned us well. In our last call, I outlined 3 areas of opportunity : continuing to develop state-of-the-art large language models and make significant improvements across our products to be more helpful to our users; empowering developers, creators and partners with our tools; and enabling organizations of all sizes to utilize and benefit from our AI advances. We have made good progress across all 3 areas. In March, we introduced our experimental conversational AI service called Bard. We have since added our PaLM model to make it even more powerful. And Bard can now help people with programming and software development tasks, including code generation. Lots more to come. For developers, we have released our PaLM API alongside our new MakerSuite tool. It provides a simple way to access our large language models and begin building new generative AI applications quickly. A number of organizations are using our generative AI large language models across Google Cloud Platform, Google Workspace and our cybersecurity offerings. For years, we've been focused on making Search even more helpful. From Google Lens to multi-search, to visual exploration in Search, immersive view in Maps, Google Translate, to all the language models powering Search today, we have used AI to open up access to knowledge in powerful ways. We'll continue to incorporate generative AI advances to make Search better in a thoughtful and deliberate way. We'll be guided by data and years of experience about what people want and our high standards for quality. And we'll test and iterate as we go because we know that billions of people trust Google to provide the right information. As it evolves, we'll unlock entirely new experiences in Search and beyond just as camera, voice and translation technologies have all opened entirely new categories of queries and exploration. AI has also been foundational to our ads business for over a decade. Products like Performance Max use the full power of Google's AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities. Philipp will talk more about this in a moment. And as we continue to bring AI to our products, our AI principles and the highest standards of information integrity remain at the core of all our work. As one example, our Perspective API helps to identify and reduce the amount of toxic text that language models train on, with significant benefits for information quality. This is designed to help ensure the safety of generative AI applications before they are released to the public. We are proud to have world-class research teams who have been advancing the breakthroughs underpinning this new era of AI. Last week, I announced that we are bringing together the Brain Team in Google Research and DeepMind into one unit. Combining all this talent into one focused team, backed by the pooled computational resources of Google, will help accelerate our progress and develop the most capable AI systems safely and responsibly. On to my second theme, the company's sharpened focus. I spoke last quarter about our commitment to invest responsibly and with discipline and to find areas where we can operate more cost effectively and with greater velocity. We have significant multiyear efforts underway to create savings, such as improving machine utilization and finding more scalable and efficient ways to train and serve machine learning models. We are making our data centers more efficient, redistributing workloads and equipment where servers aren't being fully used. This is important work as we continue to significantly invest in infrastructure to drive our many AI opportunities. Improving external procurement is another area where data suggests significant savings, and this work is underway. And we are taking concrete steps to manage our real estate portfolio to ensure it meets our current and future needs. We'll continue to use data to determine additional areas for durable savings. Next, Google Cloud. I'm pleased with the ongoing momentum in Cloud. Our disciplined expansion of our product road map and go-to-market organization has helped to build one of the largest enterprise software companies in the world. We have consistently grown top line revenues and improved annual operating margins, and we continue to do so this quarter. Our growth has come from our deep relationships with large enterprises, a strong partner ecosystem and our product leadership. Over the past 3 years, GCP's annual deal volume has grown nearly 500%, with large deals over $250 million growing more than 300%. Nearly 60% of the world's 1,000 largest companies are Google Cloud customers, and many leading start-ups and millions of small and medium enterprises use Google Cloud. We have also built a strong partner ecosystem. Over the last 4 years, the number of Google Cloud Partner certified practitioners around the world has increased more than 15x. The largest global system integrators have built 13 dedicated practices with Google Cloud compared to 0 when we started. And today, more than 100,000 companies are part of our Google Cloud Partner Advantage program. Our growth is also driven by our product leadership. We are bringing our generative AI advances to our cloud customers across our cloud portfolio. Our PaLM generative AI models and Vertex AI platform are helping Behavox to identify insider threats, Oxbotica to test its autonomous vehicles and Lightricks to quickly develop text-to-image features. In Workspace, our new generative AI features are making content creation and collaboration even easier for customers like Standard Industries and Lyft. This builds on our popular AI Bard Workspace tools, Smart Canvas and Translation Hub used by more than 9 million paying customers. Our product leadership also extends to data analytics, which provides customers the ability to consolidate their data and understand it better using AI. New advances in our data cloud enable Ulta Beauty to scale new digital and omnichannel experiences while focusing on customer loyalty; Shopify to bring better search results and personalization using AI; and Mercedes-Benz to bring new products to market more quickly. We have introduced generative AI to identify and prioritize cyber threats, automate security workflows and response and help scale cybersecurity teams. Our cloud cybersecurity products helped protect over 30,000 companies, including innovative brands like Broadcom and Europe's Telepass. We are successfully integrating Mandiant with our products, including Mandiant Threat Intelligence and Breach Analytics. Our open approach to AI development, coupled with our industry-leading TPUs and best-in-class GPUs from NVIDIA, enable innovative companies to tackle any AI workload with speed and flexibility. AI21 Labs, Replit, Midjourney and many others build and train foundation models and generative AI platforms. We are the only cloud provider to announce availability of NVIDIA's new L4 Tensor Core GPU with the launch of our G2 VMs, which are purpose-built for large inference AI workloads, such as generative AI. Turning next to YouTube. Let me start by thanking Susan Wojcicki for her terrific leadership of YouTube for 9 years. She recently transitioned into an advisory role with Alphabet this quarter, with Neal Mohan, a long-time leader at Google and YouTube, becoming the new head of YouTube. Here are a few highlights from the quarter. YouTube Shorts continues to see strong momentum with Creators. Last year, the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts daily grew over 80%. Those posting weekly on Shorts saw the majority of new channel subscribers coming from their Shorts post. The living room remained our fastest-growing screen in 2022 in terms of watch time, and we are seeing growth and momentum internationally. On our subscription business, we rolled out several new updates to YouTube Premium. Premium subscribers can now queue videos on phones and tablets, stream continuously while switching between devices and auto-download recommended videos for off-line viewing. And we have great momentum around YouTube TV and YouTube Primetime channels. We have announced pricing for the NFL Sunday Ticket offering, which will help to drive subscriptions, bring new viewers to YouTube's paid and ad-supported experiences and create new opportunities for Creators. To close across the company, we are excited about helping people, businesses and society reach their full potential with AI. We'll share updates at Google I/O about how we are using AI across our products, including our Pixel devices and share some exciting new developments for Android. Thanks to our employees around the world who continue to work hard to advance our mission. After nearly 25 years, the work to organize the world's information and make it accessible and useful is as urgent as ever, and I look forward to the work ahead. Over to you, Philipp. Philipp Schindler : Thanks, Sundar, and hey, everyone. It's great to be here today. I'll kick off with Google Services' performance in the first quarter, then provide color into our key opportunity areas and then turn it over to Ruth for more on our financial performance. Google Services revenue of $62 billion were up 1% year-on-year, including the effect of a modest foreign exchange headwind. In Google Advertising, Search and Other, revenues grew 2% year-over-year, reflecting an increase in the travel and retail verticals, offset partially by a decline in finance as well as in media and entertainment. In YouTube Ads, we saw signs of stabilization and performance, while in network, there was an incremental pullback in advertiser spend. Google Other revenues were up 9% year-over-year led by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions revenues. Now let's double-click into the 3 areas I laid out last quarter where we see clear opportunities for long-term growth in advertising : number one, Google AI; number two, retail, which cuts across all of our ads products and services; and number three, YouTube. First, Google AI. I've said before, AI has long been an important driver of our business. Advancements are powering our ability to help businesses, big and small, respond in real time to rapidly changing market and consumer shifts and deliver measurable ROI when it's needed most. In Q1, we continue to innovate across our products. Take Core Search, for example. In targeting, we updated search keyword relevance using the latest natural language AI from MUM models to improve the relevance and performance of shown ads when there are multiple overlapping keywords eligible for an auction. In bidding, we improved our Smart Bidding models to bid more accurately based on differences in search ad formats. In other words, bid more effectively depending on how a user wants to engage with an ad. In Creatives, we opened our Automatically Created Assets beta to all advertisers in English. ACA generates text assets alongside your responsive search ads and uses AI to help reduce the amount of manual work to keep creatives fresh and relevant to users' query, context and to the advertisers' business. To then unlock Core Search further and maximize conversions across all of Google, we're actively helping more advertisers paired together with Performance Max. Advertisers who use PMax are, on average, achieving over 18% more conversions at a similar CPA. This is up 5 points in just 14 months, thanks to advances in the AI underlying bidding, creatives, search query matching and new formats like YouTube Shorts. I mentioned earlier that travel was a contributor to growth. In March, we launched PMax for travel goals. Now even the smallest hoteliers can benefit from the expanded reach of hotel ads in PMax, like family-run Corissia Hotels Group, who drove a 32% increase in revenue and a 26% increase in total direct bookings within just 1 month of using PMax for travel goals. There's more to come here as we add even more AI product features. Stay tuned for more at Google Marketing Live in May. Moving on to retail where we had a solid quarter. Our focus is on 3 pillars : number one, making Google a core part of shopping journeys for consumers and a valuable place for merchants to connect with users; number two, empowering more merchants to participate in our free listings and ads experiences; and number three, driving retail performance further with great ads products. In a macro environment of do more with less, our tools and solutions are proving that we can deliver value for retailers online and omnichannel and drive high-value customers even in challenging times. Caraway, a direct-to-consumer maker of cookware, use Target ROAS to uncap budgets and PMax to optimize and deploy spend across Google inventory for its Q4 Black Friday campaign. PMax drove a 46% increase in revenue and 31% jump in ROAS, leading to Caraway's best business day in history and a robust reinvestment in its AI-first strategy for Q1.  For omni-focused retailers, we recently rolled out store sales reporting and bidding in Performance Max for store goals. This is helping retailers go beyond just optimizing to online conversions to also optimize to their stores, reaching and bidding for high-value customers who are more likely to spend in store. Danish department store, Magasin, recently used our store sales solution to boost its omnichannel ROAS 128% versus online-only campaigns. Thanks to dynamic in-store values coming from its first-party data, including its high-value customers, Magasin can now, with confidence, measure the full impact of its online investments on both e-commerce and physical store revenue. Turning to YouTube. Creators fuel YouTube's success. Across long form and shorts, music and podcasts, vertical and horizontal, YouTube is where Creators are incentivized to make their best work, which means the best content, more viewers and more opportunities for advertisers. As I said last quarter, our creator ecosystem and multi-format strategy will be key drivers of YouTube's long-term growth. And to support this growth, we're focused on, number one, Shorts; number two, engagement on CTV; number three, investing in our subscription offerings; and number four, a longer-term effort to make YouTube more shoppable. First, Shorts. We're seeing strong watch time growth. Monetization is also progressing nicely. People are engaging and converting on ads across Shorts at increasing rates. Number two, connected TV. As Sundar said, we're seeing momentum globally. Viewers love watching YouTube creators and their favorite content on the large screen. Advertisers are leaning in. Zooming out more broadly for a second. Across YouTube, we're helping brands benefit from our expansive reach and drive the profitability they're looking for. In one of our largest marketing mix modeling studies to date, YouTube ROI is 40% higher than linear TV and 34% higher than all other online video, according to a customer analysis from January 2020 to March 2022 of Nielsen Compass ROI benchmarks across 16 countries and $19 billion of total media spend measured. This proves YouTube's ability to drive effectiveness at scale. Next up are subscription offerings. The goal is to be a one-stop shop for multiple types of video content across both ad-supported and Premium services. Our launch of multiview on YouTube TV and our first-of-its-kind a la carte access for NFL Sunday Ticket are 2 examples of how we're investing here. Expect more updates over the coming quarters. Number four, shopping on YouTube. It's still super early days. One highlight, last year, we brought shopping to more creators and brands by partnering with commerce platforms like Shopify. Now more than 100,000 creators, artists and brands have connected their own stores to their YouTube channels to sell their products. We're excited about the potential ahead. I'll close with an awesome example of how we're bringing the best across Google to our partners to accelerate innovation, Mercedes-Benz. In February, we announced a first-of-its-kind partnership to bring Google Maps platform and YouTube into future Mercedes-Benz vehicles equipped with its next-gen MB.OS operating system. Beyond enabling the luxury automaker to design a customized navigation interface, we'll also provide AI and data cloud capabilities to advance their autonomous driving efforts and create an enhanced customer experience. On that note, a big thank you, first, to our customers and partners for their trust and collaboration; and second, to all Googlers for all of their incredible work this quarter. Ruth, over to you. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Philipp. Our financial results for the first quarter reflect continued healthy fundamental growth in Search and momentum in Cloud. As I go through the discussion today, I will reference some changes to our reporting and disclosures that are covered more fully in the 8-K we filed last week. I will conclude with our outlook. For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $69.8 billion, up 3% or up 6% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth on a constant currency basis. In terms of expenses and profitability, year-on-year comparisons are impacted by 3 factors : first, the $2.6 billion in charges we took in the first quarter related to workforce and office space reductions. We provided a table in our earnings release that shows the impact of those charges on cost of revenues and operating expenses. Second, the adjustment we made to the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment at the beginning of 2023. As you can see in our earnings release, the effect for the first quarter was a reduction in depreciation expense of $988 million. Third, the shift in timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards from January to March delays the step-up in SBC from Q1 to Q2. This shift in timing does not affect the total amount of SBC over the full year 2023. Total cost of revenues was $30.6 billion, up 3%, driven by other cost of revenues of $18.9 billion, which was up 7%, the biggest factor of which was compensation costs associated with data centers and other operations and followed by content acquisition costs. Operating expenses were $21.8 billion, up 19%, with a significant impact from the charges related to workforce and office space reductions. Operating income was $17.4 billion, down 13%, and our operating margin was 25%. Net income was $15.1 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $17.2 billion in the first quarter and $62 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $115 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to our segment results. These were affected by 2 additional changes outlined in our 8-K filing. First, reflecting the increasing collaboration between DeepMind and Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, as of Q1, DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. And second, beginning in the first quarter, we updated our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. In our filing, we provided a recast of prior period results for the segment for these 2 changes. The highlights of the year-on-year performance of our segments that I will review reflect these recast results. Starting with Google Services. Revenues were $62 billion, up 1%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $40.4 billion in the quarter were up 2%. YouTube advertising revenues of $6.7 billion were down 3%. Network advertising revenues of $7.5 billion were down 8%. Other revenues were $7.4 billion, up 9%, reflecting primarily ongoing significant subscriber growth in YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium. TAC was $11.7 billion, down 2%, primarily reflecting a mix shift between Search and Network. Google Services operating income was $21.7 billion, down 1%, and the operating margin was 35%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $7.5 billion for the quarter, up 28%. Growth in GCP remained strong across geographies, industries and products. Google Workspace's strong results were driven by increases in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had operating income of $191 million, and the operating margin was 2.6%. As to our Other Bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $288 million, and the operating loss was $1.2 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business. In terms of the operating environment, our results in the first quarter reflected ongoing headwinds due to a challenging economic environment, and the outlook remains uncertain. Foreign exchange headwinds have moderated, and we expect less of a foreign exchange headwind in the second quarter based on current spot rates. With respect to Google Services, within advertising, Q1 results reflect the resilience of Search with its unique ability to surface demand and deliver measurable ROI. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the revenue growth of Search was similar to last quarter. In YouTube, we saw signs of stabilization in ad spend on a sequential basis. We continue to prioritize growth in Shorts engagement where we are encouraged by progress in monetization. As to other revenues, in YouTube subscriptions, we are pleased with the significant ongoing subscriber growth in both YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV. In Play, revenues were down year-on-year, primarily due to the continued impact of foreign exchange in APAC, although results have improved as we lapped the impact from our introduction of fee reductions last year. Turning to Google Cloud. Our investments in product innovation, our go-to-market organization and our partner ecosystem delivered strong results as customers across industries and geographies increasingly rely on Google Cloud to digitally transform their businesses. That being said, in Q1, we continued to see slower growth of consumption as customers optimized GCP costs, reflecting the macro backdrop which remains uncertain. In terms of operating performance, we remain focused on driving long-term profitable growth in Cloud while continuing to invest given the substantial opportunity. Moving to Other Bets. In the first quarter, we similarly worked to refine strategies and prioritize efforts across the portfolio, including reductions to head count. I will now walk you through an update on our efforts to reengineer our cost base, slowing the pace of operating expense growth while creating capacity for key investment areas, particularly in support of AI across the company. First, as discussed on the fourth quarter call, we have efforts underway in 3 broad categories : number one, using AI and automation to improve productivity across Alphabet for operational tasks as well as the efficiency of our technical infrastructure; number two, managing our spend with suppliers and vendors more effectively; and number three, continuing to optimize how and where we work. As we've noted previously, all 3 work streams are ramping up this year, and we plan to build on these efforts in 2024 and in subsequent years. Second, with respect to head count growth. The reported number of employees at the end of the first quarter includes almost all of the employees impacted by the workforce reduction we announced in January. We expect most of the impacted individuals will no longer be reflected in our head count by the end of the second quarter. In terms of the outlook for head count for the year, as we shared last quarter, we are meaningfully slowing the pace of hiring in 2023 while still investing in priority areas, particularly for top engineering and technical talent. In terms of our investments in AI, we are excited about the creation of Google DeepMind, combining the Brain Team from Google Research with DeepMind, with the goal to accelerate innovation and impact. Beginning in the second quarter of 2023, the costs associated with teams and activities transferred from Google Research will move from Google Services to Google DeepMind within Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. Finally, as it relates to CapEx, for 2023, we now expect total CapEx to be modestly higher than in 2022. As discussed last quarter, CapEx this year will include a meaningful increase in technical infrastructure versus a decline in office facilities. We expect the pace of investment in both data center construction and servers to step up in the second quarter and continue to increase throughout the year. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have 2. First one for Sundar. Sundar, I guess as you think over the course of the next 12 months, I know you have a lot of new AI tools to show us, what new behavior changes or capabilities are you most excited about for users, developers and advertisers as these tools come out? And then the second one for Ruth. Could you talk to us about how much of the AI tools have you incorporated internally to sort of drive more productivity out of your engineers, your sales force, your G&A? Or is that sort of something to come over the next couple of years? Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Brian. It is an exciting time. I do think we see an opportunity across the breadth of what we do at Google to improve our experiences. Obviously, in Search, we have been using AI for a while. It's what has really helped lead Search and Search quality for the past few years using LLMs. We now have a chance to more natively use LLMs. And I think the main way -- and by the way, as I said in my remarks, we are going to be deliberate. We're going to -- our North Star is getting it right for users. So we'll iterate and innovate as we have always done. The main area maybe I'm excited by is we do know from experience that users come back to Search. They follow on. They're engaging back on stuff they already did. And so for us, to use LLMs in a way we can serve those use cases better, I think it's a real opportunity. Obviously, if it's YouTube, the chance to really improve experiences for Creators and consumers in terms of how the videos are viewed, et cetera, I think you can expect changes. Workspace, we already have changes rolling out, and it's an area where I think we'll see the biggest advances because I think productivity is a strong use case in which generative AI can help. And obviously, on Cloud, this has been an important moment to us, pretty much every organization is thinking about how to use AI to drive transformation. And so across the board, from start-ups to large companies, they are engaging with us. And so I view it as a point of inflection there as well. Ruth? Ruth Porat : And then in terms of the second part of your question, AI has been so much a part of what we've been doing for quite some time that there are a number of different ways to answer it. One is, as I noted, we have a number of efficiency efforts underway, and one of them is about using AI and automation to further improve productivity across Alphabet. That being said, we already have AI in a lot of what we do, for example, in the way we operate and run the finance organization. It's helpful in a lot of the analytics that we use. And one of the exciting things for us is the opportunity then to share that with Cloud customers. And Sundar just noted what we're doing within Google Workspace. We obviously all live on Google Workspace. And so that's another example of how we benefit internally from the productivity from AI, but it's also something that's available for users and enterprise customers more broadly. And then finally, one of the areas that we've talked about is the opportunity with our compute capacity and all that we've done there and the infrastructure innovation which, again, is helpful internally for what we do but on behalf of our customers. Operator : The next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : One for Sundar and then one for Ruth. Sundar, just as you think about integrating Bard into your Search products over time, can you just talk more about what percentage of Search queries you think would utilize large language model-type responses? And how should we think about the cost of running Search on these models relative to today? And then, Ruth, I was just hoping you could follow up on your comment on CapEx, maybe if you could help us understand the modest step-up in CapEx relative to 3 months ago. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Doug. Obviously, we have launched Bard as a complementary product to Search. But we'll be bringing LLM experiences more natively into Search as well. I do think, first of all, we'll be rolling it out in an incremental way so that we can test, iterate and innovate. So I think we'll approach it that way. I think overall, I think it can apply to a broad range of queries. So I think I'm excited that it can allow us to better help users in a category of queries, maybe in which there was no right answer and they are more creative, et cetera. So I think those are opportunities. But even in our existing query categories where we get a chance to do some heavy lifting for the users and use AI to better guide them, I think you will see us exploring in those directions as well. It's early days, but I think there's a lot of innovation to come. On the cost side, we have always -- cost of compute has always been a consideration for us. And if anything, I think it's something we have developed extensive experience over many, many years. And so for us, it's a nature of habit to constantly drive efficiencies in hardware, software and models across our fleet. And so this is not new. If anything, the sharper the technology curve is, we get excited by it, because I think we have built world-class capabilities in taking that and then driving down cost sequentially and then deploying it at scale across the world. So I think we'll take all that into account in terms of how we drive innovation here, but I'm comfortable with how we'll approach it. Ruth Porat : And in terms of CapEx, we do now expect that total CapEx for the year, for 2023, will be modestly higher than in 2022. And I tried to point out that we're expecting a step-up in the second quarter, and that will continue to increase throughout the year. And as we discussed last quarter, AI is a key component. It underlies everything that we do. And we're continuing to invest in support of AI, support of our users, advertisers and our Cloud customers as we're commenting on here. And then as we talked about last quarter, the increase in CapEx for the full year 2023 reflects the sizable increase in technical infrastructure investment and, on the flip side, a decline in office facilities relative to last year. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Maybe 2, if I could, first on cloud. Obviously, one of the dominant themes, and you touched upon it, is this client optimization theme that's going on broadly in cloud computing. Can you give us a little bit more of your perspective on where we are in terms of the optimization theme broadly in cloud computing as a headwind to either revenue growth or backlog growth compared to the tailwinds of broader long-term consumption growth and, possibly, the contribution of AI initiatives to cloud computing growth? And then second on YouTube, obviously, you've seen a lot of success with respect to engagement and consumption on Shorts. Can you give us an update on where we are on monetization in Shorts compared to the consumption you've already seen in usage shifts? Ruth Porat : So in terms of the cloud question, the point we're trying to underscore is there's uncertainty in the economic environment. And so we saw some headwind from slower growth of consumption, with customers really looking to optimize their cost given that macro climate. I'll leave the forecasting to you on that. But as both Sundar and I commented on, really pleased with the momentum that the team has been delivering and the breadth of what they've been working on. Sundar Pichai : I do think, I would add, that we are leaning into optimization. I mean that's an important moment to help our customers, and we take a long-term view. And so it's definitely an area we are leaning in and trying to help customers make progress in their efficiencies where we can. Philipp? Philipp Schindler : Yes, on the Shorts side, look, Shorts viewership is growing rapidly. We announced 50 billion plus daily views on the Q4 earnings call, up from 30 billion last spring. We're pleased with our continuing progress in monetization. As I said earlier, people are engaging and converting on ads across Shorts at increasing rates. Closing the gap between Shorts and long form is a top priority for us as is continuing to build a greater creator and user experience. Ads on Shorts are now available via video action app, Discovery and Performance Max campaigns and via product feeds. Shorts also are shoppable. Again, we're the only destination where Creators can produce all forms of content across multiple formats and screens with multiple ways to make a living. And as Sundar said, last year, the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts daily grew over 80%. And then in February, we brought revenue sharing to Shorts via our YouTube Partner program. Our sustainable revenue sharing model at scale remains pretty unique in the industry, and we continue to see strong creator adoption. So ultimately, our goal is to make YouTube the best places for Shorts viewers and Creators. And that's really what we're focused on right now. Operator : The next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Ross Sandler : I'll just ask a tough question. Sundar, you came up in a group that structured a lot of the Android partnerships from inception and I believe possibly the iOS agreement as well. So how do you feel about Alphabet's ability to maintain the unit economics with these partnerships in light of Microsoft's ambitions to increase its share of paid search? And Ruth, does this have any impact on your outlook for profitability of overall Alphabet over the long term? Sundar Pichai : Maybe I'll -- look, I think, these dynamics have always been around. It's important to remember. As far as I can remember, we've always been in a competitive environment for these deals. And while I can't comment on the specifics of any of our partnership agreements, what has served us well is always, first of all, building the best product possible, focused on giving value to users. And when we work with our partners, we work hard to create a win-win experience. And ultimately, partners end up choosing us because that's what their users want. That's always been what's helped Search be widely distributed. So I think it all starts with continuing to innovate and improve Search and making sure we are leading there. So I think we've always approached it very robustly over the many, many years, and I'm comfortable that we'll continue to be able to do so. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of just longer-term profitability, I think I'll broaden out your question somewhat because the way we're looking at it is we continue to be committed to investing for growth, and we want to ensure we have overall capacity for growth. And so we have a number of work streams underway to, as we keep describing it, durably reengineer our cost base. And in particular, what we're excited about are long-term opportunities with AI and we want to make sure we have the capacity to continue to invest there in the other areas where we see long-term growth in Search and Ads, Cloud, YouTube, hardware. And so that underscores our efforts to build in additional flexibility. And as we have said repeatedly, we want to ensure that expense growth is not growing out of revenue growth, and that means driving revenue growth and really being as disciplined as we can on these various work streams that we've discussed earlier in this call and last quarter as well to improve our expense growth trajectory. Operator : The next question will come from Justin Post of BAML. Justin Post : Maybe one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, you got the cost question on learning language models into Search. Can you talk about revenues? I think, on one hand, you'll see better relevancy and maybe better results with higher conversion. But on the other hand, there might be fewer areas for ads or fewer queries because people get answers more quickly. Are you optimistic on that transition? Maybe give us your thoughts there.  And then, Ruth, backing out the onetime charges, it looks like OpEx growth is now 8%, so real progress there. Could you give us a flavor of where you are, you think, in your optimization cycle? Sundar Pichai : So first of all, throughout the years, as we have gone through many, many shifts in Search, and as we've evolved Search, I think we've always had a strong grounded approach in terms of how we evolve ads as well. And we do that in a way that makes sense and provide value to users. The fundamental drivers here are people are looking for relevant information. And in commercial categories, they find ads to be highly relevant and valuable. And so that's what drives this virtuous cycle. And I don't think the underpinnings over the fact that users want relevant commercial information, they want choice in what they look at, even in areas where we are summarizing and answering, et cetera, users want choice. We care about sending traffic. Advertisers want to reach users. And so all those dynamics, I think, which have long served us well, remain. And as I said, we'll be iterating and testing as we go. And I feel comfortable we'll be able to drive innovation here like we've always done. Ruth Porat : And in terms of our OpEx trajectory, yes, there was the elevated expense and OpEx from the $2.6 billion in severance and office space charges. There was also a $988 million benefit from lower depreciation due to the change in useful lives, but that obviously is an ongoing benefit. And there was also, as we noted in our earnings release, a benefit from the shift in timing of stock-based compensation from the first quarter to the second quarter, so a little bit of complexity there. But at the core of your question, we remain extremely focused on these various work streams that we've talked about. It starts with the pace of hiring. It goes to the various work streams that both Sundar and I referenced around using AI and automation to improve productivity, all that we're doing with suppliers and vendors to be as efficient as possible, all that we're doing around optimizing how and where we work. You've seen some of those announcements this quarter beyond the workforce reduction, things that we're doing in, for example, office services, and we're executing against each of these various work streams. So our view is that there's more to do. And as we try to be clear, we're in execution mode. You'll see some of the benefit in '23, you'll see more of it in '24 and we're going to continue building against it beyond. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Michael Nathanson : I have one for Philipp and one for Ruth. Philipp, we're trying to get under the hood on Search advertising and trying to understand changes in demand between sellers of goods and sellers of services. Can you give us any help looking at the service side? Has demand returned back to pre-pandemic levels? And then in terms of goods and e-commerce, have you seen a slowing of demand? Anything you can help us kind of put this -- level set it back to maybe pre-pandemic levels to understand services versus goods demand? And then for Ruth, on the terms of efficiency and being more diligent, how does the significantly higher cost of capital impact the way you're managing and evaluating the Other Bets assets? Anything there on how you may be rethinking some of the Other Bets? And what are you doing in changing some of the structures about the Other Bets assets? Ruth Porat : It was a bit hard to hear you. You were breaking up. So I think I'm going to start and address what I heard as to the second question, as we're looking at higher cost of capital in this environment, how does that affect the way we're looking at Other Bets. Hopefully, we heard you correctly. It was crackling. Look, I think as we've talked about repeatedly, as it relates to Other Bets, our focus is to use deep technology to drive innovation, and we're very focused on the pace of investment and financial returns. That has been a consistent focus to generate attractive returns. And I think the core operating models and the long-term operating models are going to be the most relevant as we're looking at the returns we can generate. Yes, absolutely mindful of the higher cost of capital, but I think, at its core, we're looking at what's the value creation and the return on those. And as we indicated when we went through the reduction in force, we similarly worked across the Other Bets. And some of them, as they're on a path to ongoing growth, we were moderating what is the expense trajectory there as we're looking at what's the overall return on invested capital. And we're continuing to work on these to make sure that we're delivering value. And your point is an important one, that's part of a broader question about the underlying operating assumptions. Michael Nathanson : Okay. Philipp, I don't know if you heard the first one. Philipp Schindler : Yes. On the first part, again, it didn't come across quite clearly, but I hope I understood correctly. In Search, revenues grew modestly year-over-year, again, reflecting an increase in the retail and travel verticals, offset partially by a decline in finance and media and entertainment. So excluding the impact of FX performance, it was actually similar to last quarter. The ongoing performance of Search, notwithstanding the headwinds, reflects really Search's resilience with the, I'd say, ability of Search to surface demand and deliver a measurable ROI in an uncertain environment. I called out the key verticals in the quarter. There's really no additional color on other verticals. I'd say, maybe more broadly, what we saw reflects what's being reported elsewhere. And across the headlines, many companies are very focused on shorter-term profitability amidst this uncertainty and some pulled back ads budgets as well. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore. Mark Stephen Mahaney : Can I try 2 questions, please? I think, Philipp, you talked about kind of a more of a pullback in network ad revenue versus Search and YouTube. Do you have any thoughts on why that was the case? And then Ruth, the Cloud business, even with the accounting changes, saw this very steady march towards profitability. You turned the corner now. You talked about growing the business for long-term profitability. But are there any reasons why we wouldn't -- why they shouldn't be sustainably profitable kind of starting from here as the business continues to scale? Or could it be that, that profitability could be wobbly for a while before it's sustainably profitable, that segment cloud? Ruth Porat : Yes, why don't I just -- I'll take both of those. So in network, really, it's a continuation of what we talked about last quarter. We saw the ongoing pullback in advertiser spend. And I would contrast that last quarter, we talked about both a pullback in YouTube and Network, and we were pleased that we saw the stabilization in ad spend on a sequential basis in YouTube. We still saw ongoing pullback in network, which tends to be a mix of businesses, as you know well. And then in terms of Cloud, I tried to make that clear in my opening comments as well. I think it's a really important question. We are very pleased with the Q1 results. And as both Sundar and I noted, we're intensely focused on all elements of the cost space and the long-term path to attractive profitability. At the same time, and I think at the core of your question, what we were trying to convey is we will continue to invest to support long-term growth, in particular, given the opportunities we see delivering AI capabilities to our customers. So as I've said in the past, you shouldn't extrapolate from quarter-to-quarter, but we are very pleased to be at this level and are continuing to focus on profitability and long-term value creation here. Operator : And our last question will come from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Colin Sebastian : Two for me as well. I guess, first, Sundar, the consolidation of the AI teams, I think you talked about that helping to accelerate innovation. So I'm curious, specifically with that consolidation, what are the product milestones that we should look out for related to that? And then Philipp, regarding your comments on retail, specifically on shopping and payments, how should we think about that evolving across the platform this year? Maybe similarly, what are some milestones we should look out for on that front? Sundar Pichai : Thanks. I'm quite excited by bringing the 2 world-class teams, I think, of both Brain and DeepMind. Their collective accomplishments in AI over the last decade have really set the stage for this moment, and so both getting access to pool talent so that they can work together in a coordinated way and definitely will help us pool our computational resources, too, which is going to be critical and will help us build. The core product is obviously building more capable models safely and responsibly and doing it -- taking into account all the capabilities our customers need, both on the consumer side and the cloud side and being able to iterate and getting that virtuous cycle going. So you already have seen us put out PaLM APIs, and we are incorporating PaLM across our products, but we'll continue that progress, and we'll keep you posted as we do. Philipp Schindler : So retail is an important vertical and driver for us, and I called out the year-over-year increase in retail and Search and other. I also talked earlier about the macro climate and how we've established we can really drive value for retailers, even in challenging times, whether it's online, off-line, both. We're helping them drive their business goals, meet customers wherever they choose to shop. Maybe a little more, some key trends here, retailers are increasingly focused on maintaining margins and driving ROI right now. PMax, Broad Match are key levers providing more incremental conversions, while insights on bids and budgets are really helping retailers identify opportunities for growth and efficiencies across our suite of products. I've talked at length on prior calls about omnichannel. Our local and omnichannel solutions are helping bridge the gap here between online and off-line by using AI to reach nearby shoppers, promote local inventory fulfillment options, optimize in-store visits and sales, for example. And then to help really retain loyal customers and acquiring new ones, we have YouTube app deep linking. And new customer acquisition goals in PMax are helping here, making checkouts easy with tools like virtual cards. And Chrome is obviously important. So those are just some of the key points. Overall, we're giving retailers really the best, I hope, AI-powered tools and solutions to maximize reach and ROI and really create a seamless experience, including, where possible, on the payment side for their customers, and this will continue to be our focus here. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks. James Friedland : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2023 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. James Friedland : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Jim, and hello, everyone. We are holding our call from London today. It's an important hub for us, and I'm excited to spend time with our local teams, including Google DeepMind as well as leaders and partners from across the region. This quarter, we shared great progress at I/O, Brandcast and Google Marketing Live, and we are looking forward to Cloud Next in August. The momentum across the company drove our results this quarter. We delivered solid performance in Search and YouTube and ongoing strong growth in Cloud, where we remain focused on long-term value creation. And we continue our important work to operate more efficiently, creating durable savings to fund investments in our biggest priorities. Today, I'll talk about this momentum, including our continued leadership in AI and our excitement about the evolution of Search. At I/O, we shared how we are making AI helpful for everyone in 4 important ways. First, improving knowledge and learning. This is our seventh year as an AI-first company, and we intuitively know how to incorporate AI into our products. Large language models make them even more helpful models like PaLM 2, and soon, Gemini, which we are building to be multimodal. These advances provide an opportunity to reimagine many of our products, including our most important product, Search. We are in a period of incredible innovation for Search, which has continuously evolved over the years. This quarter saw our next major evolution with the launch of the Search Generative Experience, or SGE, which uses the power of generative AI to make Search even more natural and intuitive. User feedback has been very positive so far. It can better answer the queries people come to us with today, while also unlocking entirely new types of questions that Search can answer. For example, we found that generative AI can connect the dots for people as they explore a topic or project, helping them weigh multiple factors and personal preferences before making a purchase or booking a trip. We see this new experience as another jumping off point for exploring the web, enabling users to go deeper to learn about a topic. I'm proud of the engineering excellence underlying our progress. Since the May launch, we've boosted serving efficiency, reducing the time it takes to generate AI snapshots by half. We'll deliver even faster responses over time. We are engaging with the broader ecosystem and will continue to prioritize approaches that send valuable traffic and support a healthy open web. Ads will continue to play an important role in this new search experience. Many of these new queries are inherently commercial in nature. We have more than 20 years of experience serving ads relevant to users' commercial queries, and SGE enhances our ability to do this even better. We are testing and evolving placements and formats and giving advertisers tools to take advantage of generative AI. Philipp will talk more about how we are using generative AI in our ads products to better serve both advertisers and users. Second, we are helping people use AI to boost their creativity and productivity. One example is Bard, our experiment in conversational AI. Since launching in March, it continues to get better. We rolled out a number of exciting features and capabilities earlier this month. Bard is now available in most of the world and over 40 of the most widely spoken languages.  We also added Google Lens capabilities so you can take an image and ask all kinds of questions, turn it into code and more. This new feature has been really popular, and it's been great to see people sharing their experiences. Bard can now read its responses aloud, and you can adjust them for tone and style. We continue to see great interest in using Bard for coding tasks. On productivity, earlier this year, we introduced Duet AI in both Google Cloud and Workspace. It helps people collaborate with AI to code, write and get better insights from data and more. Today, more than 750,000 Workspace users have access to the new features in preview. Third, we are making it easier for others to innovate using AI. One way is by providing Google Cloud's high-performance infrastructure optimized for a range of generative AI models. It's being used by thousands of customers and partners to transform their businesses. I'll give an update on the cloud business in just a moment. Finally, we are making sure we develop and deploy AI technology responsibly so that everyone can benefit. Last week, we signed on to joint commitments with other leading AI companies at the White House, building on the principles that have guided our work for many years. To take advantage of the AI opportunities ahead, we have been sharpening our focus as a company, investing responsibly with great discipline and finding areas where we can operate more cost effectively. We have made good progress in data center machine efficiency, which will pay dividends as we continue to invest in AI. We continue to slow our expense growth and pace of hiring and ensure our teams are aligned to our highest priorities. This quarter, we reallocated a number of teams, including aligning Waze's ad sales with our existing business organization. We are combining various engineering efforts across core infrastructure and cloud. Products like Bard and SGE are being built by small, fast-moving teams that have been reallocated to these high-priority efforts. Overall, we are actively moving people to higher priority activities within the company, and we continue to optimize our real estate footprint for current and future needs. Next, Google Cloud. We see continued growth with Q2 revenue of $8 billion, up 28%, and operating profit of $395 million. Our AI-optimized infrastructure is a leading platform for training and serving generative AI models. More than 70% of gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers, including Cohere, Jasper, Typeface and many more. We provide the widest choice of AI supercomputer options with Google TPUs and advanced NVIDIA GPUs and recently launched new A3 AI supercomputers powered by NVIDIA's H100. This enables customers like AppLovin to achieve nearly 2x better price performance than industry alternatives.  Our new generative AI offerings are expanding our total addressable market and winning new customers. We are seeing strong demand for the more than 80 models, including third-party and popular open source in our Vertex, Search and Conversational AI platforms with a number of customers growing more than 15x from April to June. Among them, Priceline is improving trip planning capabilities. Carrefour is creating full marketing campaigns in a matter of minutes. And Capgemini is building hundreds of use cases to streamline time-consuming business processes. Our new Anti-Money Laundering AI helps banks like HSBC identify financial crime risk. And our new AI-powered target and lead identification suite is being applied at Cerevel to help enable drug discovery. Our generative AI capabilities also give us an opportunity to win new customers and upsell into our installed base of 9 million paying Google Workspace customers. I mentioned Duet AI earlier. Instacart is using it to improve customer service workflows. And companies like Extend are scaling sales outreach and optimizing customer service. Customers confidently choose Workspace because of the safety and security we provide their distributed workforces. Our AI capabilities are helping us differentiate core products like cybersecurity. We have integrated AI throughout our portfolio, winning organizations like Pfizer who are using Google Cloud to transform their security operations. Chronicle Security Operations suite with Mandiant fully integrated is helping customers stay protected at every stage of the security life cycle.  In the first half of 2023, we saw a 35% increase in incident response engagements compared to the same period last year. Finally, our AI capabilities are also expanding our partner ecosystem with hundreds of ISVs and SaaS providers such as Box, Salesforce and Snorkel and the world's largest consulting firms like Accenture and Deloitte. They've collectively committed to train more than 150,000 people on Google Cloud generative AI.  Turning next to YouTube. Earlier this year, we shared that revenues across YouTube products were nearly $40 billion for the 12 months ending in March. I'm really pleased with how YouTube is growing audiences and driving increased engagement. YouTube Shorts are now watched by over 2 billion logged-in users every month, up from 1.5 billion just 1 year ago. The living room remained our fastest-growing screen in 2022 in terms of watch time. We are reaching more than 150 million people on connected TV screens in the U.S. and seeing growth in momentum internationally. And on Subscriptions, there is good growth. Late last year, we announced over 80 million YouTube Music and Premium subscribers. Sign-ups for NFL Sunday Ticket kicked off in April, and we look forward to hosting our first football season on YouTube this fall. Finally, hardware and Android. Pixel continues to have strong sales momentum. We introduced new Pixel devices at I/O, including Pixel Fold, Pixel Tablet and Pixel 7a, and we've had a great response. Android 14, our latest OS, will incorporate our advances in generative AI to personalize Android phones. The Pixel and Android teams are working together to advance the latest devices. The Pixel Fold is a great example with its many hardware and software innovations. Before I close, you may have seen that we just announced some exciting news that Ruth is taking on the important new role of President and Chief Investment Officer. As our longest-serving CFO, she has helped guide the company through an amazing period of growth, a global pandemic and the ongoing economic uncertainty that has followed. I'm excited to continue to work with Ruth, who will lead our 2024 planning and remain as CFO while we do a full search for a successor. So it's business as usual now and no change in approach for the future. I look forward to seeing the impact Ruth will have in her new role, driving our investments, engaging with our stakeholders and creating opportunities for people and communities everywhere. To close, I'm energized by the pace of innovation and the momentum across the company. With 15 products that each serve 0.5 billion people and 6 that serve over 2 billion each, we have so many opportunities to deliver on our mission. Thank you to our employees around the world for their great work this quarter. Over to you, Philipp. Philipp Schindler : Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. Happy to be here with you all today. Let's jump right into our performance for the quarter. Google Services revenues of $66 billion were up 5% year-on-year. In Google Advertising, Search and Other revenues grew 5% year-on-year, led by solid growth in the retail vertical. In YouTube Ads, revenues were up 4% year-on-year, driven by growth in brand, followed by direct response reflecting further stabilization in advertiser spend. In Network, revenues declined 5% year-on-year. Google Other revenues were up 24% year-on-year, led by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions revenues.  Let's now take a few minutes to cover our 3 key priority areas. Google AI, Retail and YouTube, which I've laid out in prior quarters as clear opportunities for long-term advertising growth. I'll then turn it over to Ruth for more details on our financial performance.  Q2 was a big quarter for Google AI and our Ads products. I/O, GML and Brandcast were a testament to our deep commitment to building cutting-edge tools and solutions that help businesses navigate complexity in real time and deliver the results they need, all while improving the experience for users.  Sundar covered some of these innovations. I'll share more. It's worth reiterating that while generative AI is now supercharging new and existing ads products with tons of potential ahead, AI has been at the core of our Ads business for years. In fact, today, nearly 80% of advertisers already use at least one AI-powered Search Ads product. Our approach to AI in ads remains grounded in understanding what drives real value for businesses right now and what's most helpful for users. Advertisers tell us they're looking for more assistive experience to get set up with us faster. So at GML, we launched a new conversational experience in Google Ads powered by a LLM tuned specifically from ads data to make campaign construction easier than ever. Advertisers also tell us they want help creating high-quality ads that work in an instant. So we're rolling out a revamped asset creation flow in Performance Max that helps customers adapt and scale their most successful creative concepts in a few clicks. And there's even more with PMax. We launched a new asset insights and new search term insights that improve campaign performance understanding and new customer life cycle goals that let advertisers optimize for new and existing customers while maximizing sales. We've long said it's all about reaching the right customer with the right creative at the right time. So later this year, Automatically Created Assets, which are already generating headlines and descriptions for search ads, will start using generative AI to create assets that are even more relevant to customer queries. Broad Match also got updates. AI-based keyword prioritization ensures the right keyword, bid, budget, creative and landing page is chosen when there are multiple overlapping keywords eligible. And then to make it easier for advertisers to optimize visual storytelling and drive consideration in the mid funnel, we're launching 2 new AI-powered ad solutions, Demand Gen and Video View Campaigns, and both will include Shorts inventory. Sundar talked earlier about SGE and our early experiments with new ad formats. We're in active conversations with advertisers, publishers and partners to get their input on how to make these solutions work best for them and are excited to test and evolve this experience as we learn more. Let's pivot to retail where we had a good quarter. Profitability remains a top theme for retailers, so solutions like PMax that drive bottom line value continue to do well. We also continue to see success in helping businesses unlock efficient growth and deliver on their omnichannel goals. Take Ace Hardware, who tapped into AI-powered Search and omnibidding to capture increased seasonal demand leading up to Memorial Day. This drove increases across online sales, store visits and in-store sales, resulting in 87% year-over-year growth in Omni revenue from Google Ads and led to one of the largest revenue weeks ever for Ace store owners. Q2 also brought innovation on the consumer and merchant front. We've rolled out a new gen AI-powered virtual try-on tool that brings the fitting room experience online. Shoppers can try on women's tops across a wide array of models from brands like Anthropologie, Everlane, H&M and Loft. Rich, visual, engaging content is a win-win for both consumers and merchants. In fact, product offers with more than one image see a 76% average increase in impressions and a 32% increase in clicks. Our new Product Studio uses gen AI to help retailers create tailored, eye-catching imagery for free, and we are working towards optimizing for performance. We think this will be a game changer, especially for SMBs who can now create high-quality images to use both across Google and their own sites without spending a lot of time or money. As we continue to make Google a valuable place for merchants to grow their businesses and connect with users, Merchant Center Next is another win. We've seen 2x growth in the number of businesses using Merchant Center in the past 2 years. And we're now simplifying it by automating inventory management and giving a consolidated view of performance insights. Better tools means better growth for merchants and better experiences for users.  Moving to YouTube. I've said it before, I'll say it again. YouTube starts with our Creators, and it's their success and our multi-format strategy that will drive YouTube's long-term growth. In prior quarters, I've laid out how we think about this. Enabling our Creators to make a living on our platform with more formats and awesome tools leads to more content which leads to quality consumption of video content, another big focus of the team. And this leads to better opportunities for monetization and for advertisers to support this incredible ecosystem.  As we think about growth, we're focused on Shorts, Connected TV and our subscription offerings, all of which grew nicely this quarter. Let me double-click into Shorts and CTV. First, Shorts. Momentum remains strong. Watch time and monetization are moving in the right direction. Last year, we introduced ads on Shorts to help drive performance in direct response campaigns via video action, performance max and app campaigns. As of Q2, brand advertisers can start testing Shorts Ads in awareness campaigns. It's still early days, but we're excited by the results. Laneige, Amorepacific's #1 premium skin care brand, was an early adopter. It leaned into video reach campaigns and new creative over a 10-day test to drive a 21% increase in unique users reached from Shorts and In-feed, all in a more efficient CPM. Second, Connected TV. Substantial engagement by viewers and ROI for advertisers is driving monetization of the living room. We are very pleased with the growth we've seen and how we're delivering the reach, results and relevance that businesses are looking for at scale. At Brandcast, we announced 2 new ad offerings for streaming. First, 30-second unskippable ads are coming to YouTube Select, which is landing 70% plus of impressions on the TV screen. 30-second ads are a TV industry staple, and now YouTube is bringing our advanced audience capabilities and unparalleled reach to the format. We're also exploring new pause experiences so brands can drive awareness or action when you hit pause. Looking at YouTube holistically, according to our measurement partners, Nielsen, TransUnion and Ipsos MMA, YouTube delivers higher ROI than TV and other online video on average. Take the Hershey Company. As part of a multiyear partnership to optimize its YouTube strategy, Hershey's brands have been tapping into CTV, efficient AI-powered formats and made-for-Platform creative leading to YouTube becoming its #1 ROI driving media partner, producing a 65% plus increase in ROI from 2018 to 2023.  One last highlight that bridges the power of YouTube with our continued efforts to bring the best across Google to our partners. With Warner Brothers Discovery, we expanded our multiyear relationship across our entire Android ecosystem, including partnering on the launch of Max, a deepened, mutually beneficial relationship on Google TV, and plans to work together on new surfaces. YouTube's expanded deal for Max, inclusive of a Max NFL Sunday Ticket bundle on YouTube TV, also underscores our joint commitment to bring the highest quality content and experiences to our customers.  I'll close by echoing Sundar with a huge thank you to Googlers everywhere for their incredible passion and hard work and to our customers and partners for their continued collaboration and trust. Ruth, over to you. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Philipp. Before I go into the results, first, Sundar, thank you very much for the opportunity. I'm very excited about the new role, and I look forward to it. So turning to the results. We're very pleased with our financial results for the second quarter, which reflect an acceleration of growth in Search and momentum in Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook.  For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $74.6 billion, up 7% or up 9% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. Total cost of revenues was $31.9 billion, up 6%, driven by other cost of revenues of $19.4 billion, which was up 8%. Growth here was driven by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube subscription offerings, followed by hardware costs associated with Pixel family launches in the second quarter. As noted in our earnings release, the overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives we discussed last quarter.  Operating expenses were $20.9 billion, up 4%. Operating income was $21.8 billion, up 12%, and our operating margin was 29%. I will cover our expense and margin performance in our outlook. Other income and expense was $65 million. Net income was $18.4 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $21.8 billion in the second quarter and $71 billion for the trailing 12 months, reflecting improved operating performance as well as the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter of 2023 as noted in our earnings release. We ended the quarter with $118 billion in cash and marketable securities.  Turning to our segment results. Prior period results have been recast for 2 changes that we made as of the first quarter. First, DeepMind is now reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. Second, we updated our cost allocation methodologies. In the second quarter, we then combined the Brain team from Google Research with DeepMind to form Google DeepMind. Costs associated with the Brain team, which were previously included in Google Services, are now reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. We have not recast prior period results to reflect this additional change. Within Google Services, revenues were $66.3 billion, up 5%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $42.6 billion in the quarter were up 5%, led by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $7.7 billion were up 4%, driven by brand advertising, followed by direct response reflecting further stabilization in spending by advertisers. Network advertising revenues of $7.9 billion were down 5%. Other revenues were $8.1 billion, up 24%, reflecting growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues, primarily from subscription growth in YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV followed by growth in hardware revenues primarily driven by the launch of the Pixel 7a in the second quarter. Finally, Play returned to positive growth in the second quarter. TAC was $12.5 billion, up 3%. Google Services operating income was $23.5 billion, up 8%, and the operating margin was 35%.  Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $8 billion for the quarter, up 28%. GCP revenue growth remained strong across geographies, industries and products. That being said, we saw a continued moderation in the rate of consumption growth as consumers optimize their spend. Google Workspace strong revenue growth was driven by increases in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had operating income of $395 million and the operating margin was 5%.  As to our Other Bets, for the second quarter, revenues were $285 million, and the operating loss was $813 million. The decrease in operating loss was primarily driven by a reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets. Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within advertising. We were pleased with the acceleration of Search advertising revenue growth in the second quarter. Our continued ability to generate sustained growth reflects our unparalleled engineering innovation that creates extraordinary experiences for users and capabilities for advertisers and delivered with the deep expertise of our go-to-market team. And in YouTube, we saw ongoing signs of stabilization in advertiser spending. We are prioritizing product focus on increasing quality consumption of video content with both Shorts and in the living room, which is translating into improved monetization.  Second, within other revenues. In our YouTube subscription products, the sustained, strong growth in revenues reflects significant subscriber growth. You may have seen that last week, we increased subscription prices for YouTube Music and Premium, which underscores the value of the products. Strong year-on-year growth in hardware revenues was due, in large part, to a timing change given the Pixel 7a was launched in the second quarter, whereas the Pixel 6a launch occurred in the third quarter last year. Looking ahead, the launch timing change will be a headwind to hardware revenue growth in the third quarter. Play returned to positive growth in the second quarter, driven primarily by a solid increase in the number of buyers.  Turning to Google Cloud. We are particularly excited about the customer interest in our AI-optimized infrastructure, our large language models, our AI platform services and our new generative AI offerings such as Duet AI for Google Workspace, although we are still clearly in the early days. At the same time, we continue to experience headwinds in the second quarter for moderation in consumption growth as customers optimize their spend. We continue to invest aggressively while remaining focused on profitable growth. In terms of expenses and profitability, we remain very focused on durably reengineering our cost base. Most evident to date are the actions we have taken to reduce the pace of headcount growth, including the workforce reductions we announced in the first quarter and a slower pace of organic hiring, in part given our focus on reallocating talent from within to fuel our growth priorities. A quick comment on the sequential improvement in operating margins in the second quarter. There are 2 factors to note. First, the benefit from an acceleration in search advertising revenue growth in the second quarter. Second, the vast majority of the charges related to our workforce reduction and optimization of our global office space were taken in Q1. Finally, as it relates to CapEx, in Q2, the largest component was for servers, which included a meaningful increase in our investments in AI compute. The sequential step-up in the second quarter was lower than anticipated for 2 reasons. First, with respect to office facilities, we continue to moderate the pace of fit-outs and ground-up construction to reflect the slower expected pace of headcount growth. Second, there were delays in certain data center construction projects. We expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure increasing through the back half of 2023 and continuing to grow in 2024. The primary driver is to support the opportunities we see in AI across Alphabet, including investments in GPUs and proprietary TPUs as well as data center capacity. With all that said, we remain committed to durably reengineering our cost base in order to help create capacity for these investments in support of long-term, sustainable financial value. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have 2. The first one for Sundar. Sundar, I'd be curious to learn about some of your early learnings and surprises around consumer behavior on how people are using Bard versus Search. And what new behaviors or consumer utility are you most excited about as you think about what Gemini could provide for people over the course of the next year or so? And then the second one for Ruth. Ruth, congrats on the new position. One question just about the durable expense comment. I think last quarter, you talked about the idea that expenses could grow slower than revenue in 2024. Is that still the right way to think about it? And just to confirm, does that include the impact of depreciation in those comments? Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Brian. I'll take the first part. It's definitely early days, but both across Bard and Search Generative Experience, feedback has been very positive from our users. I think we are definitely now able to serve, I would say, deeper and broader information use cases, which is very exciting. I wouldn't say surprised. So for example, people really using it to -- for coding, something we understood, but it's definitely on the new side. There's a lot of excitement around, we integrated Google Lens into Bard. We have known how big Google Lens can be. We see that in the visual searches we get and how much it has grown over the last 2 years, and so we've been doing this for a while. But definitely, that, in Bard, has been super well received. So which gives me a sense that as -- given Gemini is being built from the ground up to be multimodal, I think that's an area that's going to excite users. When I go back many years ago when we did universal search, whenever, for users, we can abstract different content types and put them in a seamless way, they tend to receive it well. And so I'm definitely excited about what's ahead. Ruth Porat : And on your second question, Brian, we are really pleased with the operating performance in the second quarter. We've been saying for some time that we are focused on revenue growth ahead of expense growth and achieved that for the first in some time, and that is cost of sales plus operating expense overall. And we do remain very focused on durably reengineering our cost base. There are a lot of stream -- work streams that are in flight, and I mentioned a couple of them in opening comments. This remains a major priority as Sundar and I both commented on. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Maybe one for Sundar and one also for Ruth. Sundar, can you talk a little bit about elements of open source versus closed and things like custom silicon and how you're thinking about AI offerings broadly developing over the next couple of years and what you see as some of the key differentiation points that Google either through the cloud business or the consumer offerings are going to bring to market, and how we should think about differentiation playing out to a greater degree in AI in the years ahead. That would be number one. And then, Ruth, I'll echo Brian's congrats as well on the new role. Maybe both of you could talk to why this type of role might be important at this point in time for Alphabet? And Ruth, what you're looking to sort of drive into the organization from this new role as you move into it in the fall. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Eric. On the first part, obviously, a big topic. I would broadly say, the investments for AI, when you look at the type of deep computer science work, the talent we have worked hard to bring to the company and from the ground up, the infrastructure we have built, from the earliest days Google has been a company, we've thought about the switches in our data centers. Wherever we think we can do the best and get an advantage by innovating, we have chosen to do so. We have done that on AI, on the silicon side. But what's important to us is really stay focused on our users and customers and support all the innovations that's needed. So for example, with cloud, we've been -- we've really embraced open architecture. We have embraced customers wanting to be multi-cloud when it makes sense for them. So similarly, you would see with AI, we will embrace -- we will offer not just our first-party models, we'll offer third-party models, including open source models. I think open source has a critical role to play in this ecosystem.  Google contributes -- we are one of the largest contributors to -- if you look at  Hugging Face and in terms of the contribution there, when you look at projects like Android, Chromium and so on, Kubernetes and so on. So we'll embrace that and we'll stay at the cutting edge of technology, and I think that will serve us well for the long term. On the second part of your question, first of all, I'm very grateful and thankful to all the work that Ruth has done for the company. It's too invaluable to capture in words. I am super thrilled that she's going to continue on an impactful new role. And  the scale of our company, with the broad changes in technology, I think it's more important than ever before to engage on these issues globally at scale and advocate on the economic opportunity of the investments we make across Alphabet and Google. And I'm glad that she's going to continue as CFO. And so no changes there, and we'll take the time to find a successor, and Ruth will be closely involved, not just on that but also our long-range planning, including 2024. Ruth, anything to add? Ruth Porat : Just to underscore, when you ask the point about impact, one of the places Sundar and I have discussed quite a bit is landing well the 2024 capital plan and the multiyear plan and completing all of the very important efforts we have underway. We're excited about what they mean, setting the company up well to be able to invest for long-term growth. And so we're continuing to execute against those. And then I think Sundar summarized it well. We see technology can make such a difference in the lives of so many and there's lives of economies. And to be able to focus on the impact on economic growth and the opportunity for people, for organizations for countries, I think, is a privilege. I'm really excited about it, in particular, with this amazing company. And so focusing there as well as the investments that we make across Alphabet to drive economic growth globally across numerous sectors. Operator : The next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : One for Sundar and one for Ruth. For Sundar, curious, how do you think about timing for more broadly integrating generative AI into Search? And more specifically, what are some of the things you'll need to see to do that? And then, Ruth, just on CapEx, the 2Q CapEx is lower than expected as you explained. Do you still expect modestly higher CapEx in '23 versus '22? And then I know it's getting a little bit ahead, but how should we think about kind of timing of that real estate and office optimization efforts through '23 and then also into '24? Sundar Pichai : Look, on the Search Generative Experience, we definitely wanted to make sure we're thinking deeply from first principles. While it's exciting new technology, we've constantly been bringing in AI innovations into Search for the past few years, and this is the next step in that journey. But it is a big change so we thought about from first principles. It really gives us a chance to now not always be constrained in the way Search was working before allowed us to think outside the box. And I see that play out in experience. So I would say we are ahead of where I thought we'd be at this point in time. The feedback has been very positive. We've just improved our efficiency pretty dramatically since the product launch. The latency has improved significantly. We are keeping a very high bar, and -- but I would say we are ahead on all the metrics in terms of how we look at it internally. And so I couldn't be more pleased with it. And so you will see us continue to bring it to more and more users. And over time, this will just be how Search works. And so while it's -- we are taking deliberate steps, we are building the next major evolution in Search, and I'm pleased with how it's going so far. Ruth Porat : In terms of CapEx, I tried to lay out sort of the cadence of CapEx, and the point was an important one that the sequential step-up in the second quarter was lower than anticipated for the 2 reasons I noted : one, the work that we're doing around office facilities; and then the delays in certain data center construction projects. That's why we wanted to be really clear that we do expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure, and that would be increasing through the back half of 2023, consistent with the comments we've made previously that we expected 2023 to be higher given the slower start at the front half of the year and then continuing to grow into 2024.  And the primary driver of this, as you know well, is to support the opportunities we see in AI across the company, including the investments that we've already talked about, proprietary TPUs, all that we're doing with GPUs as well as data center capacity. And as we continue to see the pace of innovation accelerate, we just want to make sure we're positioned to address the opportunity across Alphabet.  And to your -- the other part of your question, when we look at real estate optimization, that's one of many work streams that are important when we talk about durably reengineering our cost base to create capacity for investments and support long-term sustainable financial value, and we're continuing to work against that. Operator : The next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley of UBS. Lloyd Walmsley : I wanted to just follow up on the -- some of the SGE questions and just get a sense -- I know it's early, but what are you seeing in terms of monetization? And how do you guys think about that as you scale up the deployment of SGE? Is that -- I think there's a lot of concern out there that maybe in the short term, it's a bit of a headwind. But over the longer term, maybe query growth from a more useful product can kind of make up for that. But how do you guys see that playing out? And what can you share there? Sundar Pichai : Maybe I can give some color here. We have obviously been focused on bringing this experience and making sure it works well for users. And it's very clear to me, first of all, as a user myself, there are certain queries for which the answers are so significantly better. It's a clear quality win. And so I think we are definitely headed in the right direction, and we can see it in our metrics and the feedback we are getting from our users as well. And the thing that doesn't change with these experiences is that many -- a lot of user journeys are commercial in nature. There are inherent commercial user needs. And what's exciting to me is that SGE gives us an opportunity to serve those needs, again, better, right? Better. So it's clearly an exciting area. And as part of that, the fundamentals don't change. Users have commercial needs, and they are looking for choices, and there are merchants and advertisers looking to provide those choices.  So those fundamentals are true in SGE as well. And we have a number of experiments in flight, including ads, and we are pleased with the early results we are seeing. And so we will continue to evolve the experience, but I'm comfortable at what we are seeing, and we have a lot of experience working through these transitions, and we'll bring all those learnings here as well. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Justin Post : Great. Just ask about the Cloud. It really looks like revenue growth stabilized despite optimization. So could you talk about the pipeline and the client wins in the quarter, how you feel about those. And then any uptick are you seeing related to AI spending in the total revenues this quarter or in the second half? Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Justin. Okay. It is an exciting moment overall in Cloud because there is definitely a lot of interest from customers on AI, and they definitely are engaging in many more conversations with us. So I would say, without commenting on the short term, but when I think about it long term, I view the AI opportunity as expanding our total addressable market and allows us to win new customers. Scale of investments that we can directly bring to Cloud now. As I said earlier, we have over 80 models across Vertex, Enterprise, Search and Conversational AI, and we are taking all of them, translating it into deep industry solutions. So I'm excited about it.  Second, it gives us an opportunity to upsell and cross-sell into our installed base. So for example, if you think about Duet AI in Google Workspace now, it's a collection of all our generative AI-powered collaboration features. We can bring it and make it available to more than 9 million paying Google Workspace customers. Similarly, Duet AI in Google Cloud, again, allows us to go back to our installed base and engage in deeper conversations. And finally, I think AI helps us differentiate our core products. For example, if you take a look at cybersecurity, we are deeply incorporating AI to drive profound changes there. So overall, I'm excited, and I view this as a long-term opportunity. And all the investments we are doing in AI across Alphabet, including the work we are doing in Google DeepMind and Google Research on Gemini and so on are directly applicable to Cloud as well. So excited about it. Justin Post : Great. Maybe one follow-up for Ruth. Did the infrastructure cloud grow faster than Workspaces again this quarter? Ruth Porat : So we -- I don't think we commented on that. And yes, in the second quarter, GCP growth was above the growth rate for Cloud overall. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Nathanson of  MoffettNathanson. Michael Nathanson : One for Philipp and one for Sundar. Philipp, can you talk about the ad market? If you step back, you're seeing real signs now of weakness in linear TV, ad agencies, small and digital companies were all slowing, and the macro backdrop is definitely cloudy, yet you guys have accelerated your growth this quarter. What factors are you looking at do you see that would identify why you are growing while others are really struggling and slowing down? And then Sundar, I think you spent over $100 billion on R&D over the past 5 years, and yet there's a narrative that it's so competitive and so expensive to compete going forward. Can you talk a bit about how you're visiting that R&D spend? Any near-term cadence updates you can give us for growth? And any factors that could change the growth going forward for research and development spending for you guys? Sundar Pichai : Maybe I can comment on the -- how we think about R&D. And look, if anything, I think 2 things. We are always committed to driving deep computer science research and innovation. That's the foundation on which the company is built. And taking that and applying it and building new products and services and generating value is the virtuous cycle. And so nothing changes in that fundamental thesis. We are definitely both, as Ruth mentioned, on AI investments, we are going to be committed to making sure we invest to realize the opportunity. But all the work we are doing on efficiency and optimization applies to on the AI side as well. And so we're bringing all that lens there so that we do this responsibly. But no overall changes in our philosophy or approach there. And maybe I'll let Philipp comment on the overall market dynamics. Philipp Schindler : Yes. Look, I can't comment on others, but our focus continues obviously to be helping customers through whatever uncertainty or complexity they're facing, and a lot of companies are focused on profitability, driving efficiencies, and they're carefully evaluating the effectiveness of their budgets. And our goal is really to help them maximize efficiency and drive strong ROI. And I think we have the proven AI-powered tools and solutions to actually do it. I called out Search and Other revenues being led by solid growth in the retail vertical. We talked about the DR and brand side, on the YouTube side. I think those are the key points I would make. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Gawrelski of Wells Fargo. Kenneth Gawrelski : Can I ask on Performance Max? You've had great success there. Could you talk about any vertical or use case expansions? And how long until we possibly get to the point of more automated AI-generated creative in production? Philipp Schindler : Yes. Look, this is a great question. AI is a foundational component that really allows us to help users, advertisers,  [ publishers ] and partners at scale. And we've been on a journey for years, right, to take the key components of advertising, whether it's bidding, targeting and creatives as well as innovation, frankly, in the core advertiser and publisher experiences and improve them dramatically through AI.  And Performance Max is an example of how all this comes together at scale for advertisers. They provide us with a business goal set of assets, and we can then take care of the rest to meet consumer demand and really deliver on advertiser ROI. And as you heard it at GML, we've seen over many quarters, we continue to build new AI features really on top of this. I think I talked a bit in my prepared remarks about where we're taking some of our products from a gen AI perspective. And if you take a look at some of the things we announced there, it's fair to say, whether you look at our revamped asset creation flow in Performance Max, whether you look at Automatically Created Assets, whether you look at Product Studio and so on, then we're on a right path to deliver some really exciting new innovation in automated -- let me call it, asset creation in the broader sense. Operator : Our last question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore. Mark Stephen Mahaney : Okay. Actually, I'll follow up on that last question, Philipp. You pointed out AI has been used to improve the advertising mousetrap at Google for many years. Do you view generative AI as just a material accelerant of your ability to improve return on ad spend for the millions of marketers who use Google? And if you think about where generative AI would have the most impact, could you peel it apart what's your guess now over the next couple of years where it's going to have the most impact on the creative -- on the audience creation, on the campaign optimization? Where do you think the most impact will come from generative AI just for all the -- your advertising customers? Philipp Schindler : Look, as I said earlier, generative AI is supercharging new and existing ads products with really tons of potential ahead. And we're really helping advertisers here make better decisions, solve problems, enhance creativity. And I covered this earlier. For example, we launched a new conversational experience in Google Ads, the asset creation flow. In PMax, I mentioned the automatically created assets, the Product Studio and so on. When I talk to customers, they're very excited about AI and understandably have some questions. One of the top questions is, for example, what's the next best step I should take. And this is a key reason why we launched our Google Ads AI Essentials, which was a big announcement at GML. It's a checklist of simple steps customers can take right now to unlock the power of AI, and it has to do with the foundation of data and measurement. It has to do with taking action with our AI-powered products and really is a mindset shift to set up organizations for AI success. So those are just some of the examples. If you extrapolate those going forward, those are some of the examples where I see a lot of upside apart from the points that Sundar already mentioned. Sundar Pichai : And I think all of this is before we have multimodal capabilities really in the mix. And so looking at the early innovations there, I think it's going to be an exciting couple of years ahead. Thanks, Mark. Mark Stephen Mahaney : Congratulations, Ruth. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks. James Friedland : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2023 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jim Friedland : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat. Now, I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Form 10-K, including our Risk Factor section and our Form 10-Qs. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our investor relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. And now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Jim, and hello, everyone. I'm pleased with our business results this quarter, which demonstrates strong growth in Search and YouTube and momentum in Cloud. Google turned 25 in September, which offered an opportunity to reflect on our progress over the last quarter century and to look ahead to the opportunities enabled by AI we are so excited and confident about. Our product momentum continued this quarter, as you saw with Cloud Next, Made on YouTube and Made by Google. It's all part of our focus on making AI more helpful for everyone, and we are making good progress across the four areas that we shared last quarter. First, improving knowledge and learning. This includes our work with the Search Generative Experience, which is our experiment to bring Generative AI capabilities into Search. We have learned a lot from people trying it, and we have added new capabilities, like incorporating videos and images into responses and generating imagery. We've also made it easier to understand and debug generated code. Direct user feedback has been positive with strong growth and adoption. In August, we opened up availability to India and Japan with more countries and languages to come. As we add features and expand into new markets, we are engaging with the broader ecosystem and will continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users, send valuable traffic to publishers, and support a healthy open Internet. With Generative AI applied to Search, we can serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives. We are surfacing more links with SGE and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page, creating new opportunities for content to be discovered. Of course, ads will continue to play an important role in this new Search experience. People are finding ads helpful here as they provide useful options to take action and connect with businesses. We'll experiment with new formats native to SGE that use Generative AI to create relevant high-quality ads customized to every step of the Search journey. The second area we are focused on is boosting creativity and productivity. Bard is particularly helpful here. It's a direct interface to a conversational LLM, and we think of it as an early experiment and complementary experience to Google Search. Bard can now integrate with Google apps and services, showing relevant information from Workspace, Maps, YouTube, and Google Flights and Hotels. We've also improved the Google it feature. It provides other sources to help people evaluate Bard's responses and explore information across the web. Earlier this month, we announced Assistant with Bard, a personal assistant powered by Generative AI. It combines Bard's generative and reasoning capabilities with Assistant's personalized help. You can interact with it through text, voice, or images, and in the coming months, you'll be able to opt in on Android and iOS mobile devices. Our collaborative tools in Workspace and YouTube are also part of how we boost creativity and productivity, and they are seeing great initial traction. Third, we are enabling developers, businesses, and other organizations to build their own transformative products and services. For example, thousands of customers and partners are already using Google Cloud to capture the potential of AI and we'll share more there in a minute. And fourth, we are building and deploying AI responsibly, so that everyone can benefit. One area we are focused on is making sure people can more easily identify when they are encountering AI-generated content online. Using new technology powered by Google DeepMind SynthID, images generated by Vertex AI can be watermarked in a way that is invisible to the human eye without reducing the image quality. Underlying all this work is the foundational research done by our teams at Google DeepMind and Google Research. We are excited to roll out more of what they've been working on soon. As we expand access to our new AI services, we continue to make meaningful investments in support of our AI efforts. We remain committed to durably re-engineering our cost base in order to help create capacity for these investments in support of long-term sustainable financial value. Across Alphabet, teams are looking at ways to operate as effectively as possible focused on their biggest priorities. Turning next to YouTube, which saw solid momentum in both its ads and subscription businesses in Q3. NFL Sunday Ticket is now live and receiving excellent reviews. Fans love our multi-view feature, which can live stream up to four games on a single screen. We\u2019ve heard positive feedback from our partners at the NFL about the new features and live stream reliability. This is a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with excellence and at scale. I'm really pleased with the growth and engagement on YouTube Shorts. We continue to work on closing the monetization gap here. Shorts now average over 70 billion daily views and are watched by over 2 billion signed-in users every month. At Made on YouTube in September, we announced new tools that make it easier to create engaging content. Dreamscreen is an experimental feature that allows creators to add AI-generated video or image backgrounds to shorts. And YouTube Create is a new mobile app with a suite of production tools for editing shorts, longer videos, or both. Next, Google Cloud. We see continued growth with Q3 revenue of $8.4 billion, up 22%. Today, more than 60% of the world's 1,000 largest companies are Google Cloud customers. At Cloud Next, we showcased amazing innovations across our entire portfolio of infrastructure, data and AI, workspace collaboration, and cybersecurity solutions. We offer advanced AI-optimized infrastructure to train and serve models at scale. And today, more than half of all funded Generative AI startups are Google Cloud customers. This includes AI21 Labs, Contextual, Elemental Cognition, Rytr, and more. We continue to provide the widest choice of accelerator options. Our A3 VMs powered by NVIDIA's H100 GPU are generally available, and we are winning customers with Cloud TPU v5e, our most cost efficient and versatile accelerator to date. On top of our infrastructure, our Vertex AI platform helps customers build, deploy, and scale AI-powered applications. We offer more than 100 models, including popular third-party and open source models, as well as tools to quickly build, search, and conversation use cases. From Q2 to Q3, the number of active Generative AI projects on Vertex AI grew by 7x, including Highmark Health, which is creating more personalized member materials. Duet AI was created using Google's leading large foundation models and especially trained to help users to be more productive on Google Cloud. We continue expanding its capabilities and integrating it across a wide range of cloud products and services. With Duet AI, we are helping leading brands like PayPal and Deutsche Bank boost developer productivity. And we are enabling retailers like Aritzia and Gymshark to gain new insights for better and faster business results. In fact, companies are increasingly using AI for the purpose of analyzing data. And customers are choosing Google Cloud because we are the only large cloud provider with a unified platform to analyze structured and unstructured data. In Workspace, thousands of companies and more than a million trusted testers have used Duet AI. They are writing and refining content in Gmail and Docs, creating original images from text within slides, organizing data in Sheets and more. These innovations enable us to provide new services and grow our base of 10 million paying customers, including enterprises like Grupo Boticario, Unilever and Warner Music. We also integrated Duvet AI across our cybersecurity portfolio to differentiate in the marketplace, providing Generative AI-powered assistance in Mandiant Threat Intelligence, Chronicle Security Operations, and Security Command Center. This reduces the time security teams spend writing, running, and refining searches by seven times. We are the only leading security provider that combines frontline intelligence and expertise, a modern security operations platform, and a trusted cloud foundation, all infused with Generative AI, helping protect customers and partners like BT, Jack Henry & Associates, and CoverMyMeds. Turning to hardware. We unveiled our new products this month. We introduced our new Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, and Pixel Watch 2 to very positive consumer feedback and reviews. Pixel is the fastest growing smartphone brand in our top markets and the only one that grew in units sold year-over-year. Our portfolio of Pixel products are brought to life, thanks to our combination of foundational technologies, AI, Android, and Google Tensor. Google Tensor G3 is the third generation of our tailor-built chip. It's designed to power transformative experiences by bringing the latest in Google AI research directly to our newest phones. A new AI-powered editing features in Google Photos on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro remove distractions, generate the best shot from multiple images and reduce distracting sounds in videos. Pixel and our third-party ecosystem are powered by Android. We just released Android 14 with more accessibility features. I also want to mention Chromebook Plus, a new category which provides the best of Chrome on great hardware with built-in Google Apps and powerful AI capabilities. We also shared that Chromebooks will now get regular automatic updates for 10 years, more than any other operating system. In Other Bets, Waymo is onboarding more riders to its commercial ride hailing service as it gradually adds over 100,000 people from its San Francisco waitlist. Austin will follow as its next ride hail city. Wing and Walmart announced a new partnership to provide drone delivery service in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Before handing over to Philipp, I want to thank our employees around the world who are working to create innovative products and provide great services to people and businesses who use our products. Philipp? Philipp Schindler : Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. I'll start with our performance for the quarter and then give color into the three key priority areas for ads. Google AI, Retail and YouTube that we've identified on past calls as opportunities for long-term growth in advertising. Google Services revenues of $68 billion were up 11% year-on-year. In Google Advertising, Search and Other, revenues grew 11% year-on-year, led by solid growth in the Retail vertical. In YouTube Ads, revenues were up 12% year-on-year, driven by growth in both brand and direct response. In Network, revenues declined 3% year-on-year. Google Other revenues were up 21% year-on-year, led by strong growth in YouTube subscription revenues. Let's start with Google AI. Recent dramatic advances in everything from foundational research models to LLM to Generative AI are improving our ability to deliver better performance and profitability for advertisers and more helpful, delightful experiences for users. We covered many innovations last quarter after GML, like our conversational experience in Google Ads, significant updates to Performance Max and new campaign types like Demand Gen. And as Sundar said, we're continuing to experiment with new ad formats on SGE. It's extremely important to us that in this new experience, advertisers still have the opportunity to reach potential customers along their Search journeys. I'll highlight more ways we're innovating with the best of Google AI as we double-click into our core business. In Retail, we had a great quarter. In a market where every dollar counts, our proven AI-powered solutions like Search and PMax are helping retailers drive reliable, strong ROI and meet customers wherever they are across the funnel. In Q3, we also started prepping retailers for what will be a long holiday season. Let me share some things. Number one, with a maximum number of days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and expectations for many micro peaks beyond Cyber-Five, we're arming businesses with insights and planning tools, including OptiScore and Performance Planner to uncover new opportunities, plan budgets and targets to stay competitive and be smarter with their inventory and pricing strategy. Number two. Consumer expectations are shifting, especially around price and convenience. We've seen 4x deals queries during the holidays versus other periods. 75% of users say they'll shop with those offering free shipping. Retailers are capitalizing on these trends with our differentiated merchant offerings like merchant promotions and fulfillment options. And we're making improvements to significantly boost the number of deals shown to shoppers in Search this holiday season. Look out for more in the coming days about new ways we'll help shoppers browse deals across the web this year. Number three. No surprise, omni-channel is the way to succeed. With our suite of omni product solutions, including local inventory ads, omnibidding, and PMax for store goals, retailers big and small, are capturing demand and incremental store budgets while engaging with high value customers. Innovation continues across our shopping and merchant experiences powered by Google AI. Our virtual try-on tool for apparel launched in June and has been a hit with consumers and brands. Users engage with virtual try-on images at a higher rate versus regular brand provided images. Product Studio is another launch from GML getting positive feedback in pilot mode. It uses the best of Gen.AI to help businesses create unique and tailored imagery for free that they can then scale across their channels. We're seeing early merchant testers using it to seasonalize their content for the holidays. Let's shift to YouTube. It's worth repeating, our intense focus on creator success coupled with our multi-format strategy are at the center of how we think about YouTube's long-term growth. Shorts, connected TV and our subscription offerings are key drivers here and we're investing across each to solidify YouTube's position as the best place to create, the best place to watch and the best place to deliver results. Sundar mentioned watch time and engagement momentum on shorts as well as our monetization progress. He also covered subscription growth and NFL Sunday Ticket. As for connected TV, we continue to be the number one overall streaming destination according to Nielsen. 150 million plus people are watching YouTube on CTV screens every month in the US. Whether it's music videos, NFL Sunday Ticket, free movies, shorts, a continuous stream of MrBeast or some other creator-led content, viewers want choice and variety, and we're giving it to them all in one place. And to help creators and advertisers connect with these billions of viewers across moments, screens, and formats, we're bringing Google AI to awesome new creation tools and ad solutions. AI will do wonders for creation and storytelling. From Dreamscreen and YouTube Create, which Sundar talked about, to features that audit up content in multiple languages, flip and trim existing assets, remix and clip videos, and more, we're just getting started. We're also helping brands break through at speed and scale across the funnel to drive results. Spotlight Moments launched last week. It uses AI to identify trending content around major cultural moments for brand sponsorship opportunities. There's video reach campaigns, which are expanding to in-feed and shorts and will be generally available in November. AI is helping advertisers find as many people as possible in their ideal audience for the lowest possible price. Early tests are delivering 54% more reach at 42% lower cost. And then with video view campaigns, AI is serving skippable ads across in-stream, in-feed, and shorts and helping advertisers earn the maximum number of views at the lowest possible cost. So far, they're driving 40% more views on average versus in-stream alone. Then for YouTube and other feed-based services, there's our new Demand Gen campaign, which launched in April, rolled out worldwide last week, and was designed for the needs of today's social marketers to engage people as they stream, scroll and connect. It combines video and image ads in one campaign with access to 3 billion users across YouTube and Google, and the ability to optimize and measure across the funnel using Google AI. Demand Gen is already driving success for brands like Samsung and Toyota. Before I wrap, one quick highlight on our close collaboration and commitment to our most important ecosystems and partners. In July, we launched Google News Showcase in the US, our curated online news experience and licensing program with more than 150 news publications, 90% of which are local or regional. Globally, over 2,500 news publications have signed onto News Showcase, and the product is live in 23 countries today. Our commitment to open access to news and information remains strong. With that, I'll end with a thank you to our customers and partners around the world for their continued trust and collaboration, and our Googlers everywhere for their incredible hard work and dedication. Ruth, over to you. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter, driven by meaningful growth in Search and YouTube and momentum in Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the third quarter, our consolidated revenues were $76.7 billion, up 11% in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $33.2 billion, up 7%, primarily reflecting other cost of revenues of $20.6 billion, which was up 6%. Growth here was primarily driven by content acquisition costs mainly for YouTube subscription offerings. As noted in our earnings release, the overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of the year. Operating expenses were $22.1 billion, up 6% reflecting the following. First, an increase in R&D expenses, driven primarily by compensation. Second, an increase in G&A expenses, reflecting the impact of charges related to legal matters. And finally, sales and marketing expenses, which were relatively flat to last year. Operating income was $21.3 billion, up 25%, and our operating margin was 28%. Other income and expense was a loss of $146 million. Net income was $19.7 billion. This reflects an effective tax rate of 7% in the third quarter from an IRS change related to the use of foreign tax credits, which had an outsized impact on the third quarter rate because the change resulted in a catch-up for prior periods. We delivered free cash flow of $22.6 billion in the third quarter and $78 million for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $120 billion in cash and marketable securities. As a reminder, our cash balance and free cash flow in the second and third quarters benefited from the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter of 2023. As noted in our earnings release, on October 16, we made an estimated tax payment of $10.5 billion related to this deferral, which will be reflected in our cash balance and free cash flow in the fourth quarter. Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $68 billion, up 11%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $44 billion in the quarter were up 11%, led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion were up 12%, driven by both brand advertising and direct response. Network advertising revenues of $7.7 billion were down 3%. Other revenues were $8.3 billion, up 21%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues driven by subscriber growth in YouTube TV followed by YouTube Music Premium. TAC was $12.6 billion, up 7%. Google Services operating income was $23.9 billion, up 27% and the operating margin was 35%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $8.4 billion for the quarter, up 22%. GCP revenue growth remained strong across geographies, industries and products, although the Q3 year-on-year growth rate reflects the impact of customer optimization efforts. Google Workspace also delivered strong revenue growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had operating income of $266 million, and the operating margin was 3%. As to our Other Bets, for the third quarter, revenues were $297 million and the operating loss was $1.2 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services. First, within advertising. After a period of historic volatility, we were pleased with the year-on-year revenue growth of Search and YouTube advertising in the third quarter. Second, within other revenues, in our YouTube subscription products the substantial growth in revenues primarily reflects subscriber growth. Looking ahead, a full quarter of NFL Sunday Ticket revenues as well as associated content acquisition costs will be reflected in Q4 results compared to only a few weeks in the third quarter. Play had growth in the third quarter, driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers. With respect to hardware, there is a headwind to revenues in the fourth quarter, reflecting efforts to optimize the portfolio with tighter targeting of our go-to-market investments as well as the ongoing impact from the difference in launch timing for the Pixel 6a and 7a that we mentioned last quarter. Turning to Google Cloud. We are pleased with the ongoing customer engagement with GCP and Workspace and the potential benefit of our AI solutions including infrastructure and services such as Vertex AI and Duet. We continue to invest aggressively given the significant potential we see while remaining focused on profitable growth. In terms of expenses and profitability, we're pleased with our operating performance. As we have repeatedly stressed, we remain focused on durably reengineering our cost base to create investment capacity to support our growth priorities, most important of which is with AI. We have a number of workstreams in place. First, we are maintaining a slower pace of headcount growth, reflecting product prioritization and reallocation of talent to support our most important growth opportunities. Second, we remain focused on optimizing our real estate footprint, including how and where we work to reduce our expense growth. As you can see from our earnings release, we incurred $207 million in accelerated rent and depreciation in the third quarter related to these actions. Third, we have engineering work streams underway to improve productivity across Alphabet. Given the magnitude of investment in our technical infrastructure, we have a superb team focused on efficiency of our operations there. We are also making progress in streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI. Finally, there are ongoing workstreams that are improving the efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization. And to be clear, across the portfolio of other bet companies, we have also been working to identify opportunities to create sharper focus and to operate more efficiently and effectively. With respect to sequential quarter-on-quarter trends, two further points. First, cost of sales in the fourth quarter will reflect both higher hardware costs given Pixel family launches as well as increased CAC for YouTube as previously noted. Second, as usual, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the end of the year, in part to support product launches in the holiday season. Finally, our reported CapEx in Q3 was $8 billion, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers, followed by data centers, reflecting a meaningful increase in our investments in AI compute. The growth in reported cash CapEx in Q3 is somewhat muted due to the timing of supplier payments, which can cause variability from quarter-to-quarter. We continue to invest meaningfully in the technical infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see in AI across Alphabet and expect elevated levels of investment, increasing in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continuing to grow in 2024. In closing, we remain very excited about the opportunities ahead and committed to deliver sustainable financial value. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one, maybe a sort of a jump ball. There's somewhat of an investor debate about sort of the incremental return on capital to Search when it comes to AI. I know it's early, but are there any examples that you're seeing with SGE or Bard on higher utility, higher conversion rates, more engagement, just something to sort of show signal around the return that could come from these investments? And the second one, Ruth, I know you've spoken a lot about durably reengineering the cost base. I think in the past, you've talked about how expenses could grow slower than revenue in 2024. Is that sort of still the high-level way to think about it or is that potentially changing a bit as investments are continuing? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Ruth, do you want to take the second part? Ruth Porat : Sure. Thanks for that, Brian. So overall, that's sort of a truism as you know well, that looking to grow revenues at a faster rate than expenses as we're focused on delivering sustainable financial value. And so that really takes us to the work streams, which I tried to tick through, again, those remain the driver. They're the real priority there -- those are the efforts that are going to enable us to expense growth as moderated as possible while supporting the investment growth that is so exciting in front of us, in particular, around AI. Sundar Pichai : And to your first part, obviously, we see AI as a foundational platform shift and are excited about the opportunities across our business. It starts with Search. And I've been pretty pleased with how the user feedback has been on SGE. We are rolling it out to more users. Through it all, we are making sure the product works well, and we are generating value for our ecosystem, and that adds transition as well. And I think I view this is, with AI, the opportunity to evolve Search and Assistant over the next decade ahead. And I think as we've always seen, when you continue to invest and build great experiences, you can get value on the other side. And I do think over time, there will be newer pads, just like we have done on YouTube, I think with the AI work that are subscription models is a possible path as well. And obviously, all of the AI investments we are doing applies across Cloud, too, and I'm pretty optimistic about what's ahead there as well. Brian Nowak : Great. Thank you, both. Operator : Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar and one for Ruth. Just, Sundar, you talked a lot about AI. I was hoping you could talk more about Gemini and how we'll differentiate from other models, some of the multimodal capabilities and what new experiences or agents do you think it could unlock and how we should think about timing? And then also just on Cloud, I hope you can talk about some of the factors there on the decel in Cloud and just what you're seeing in terms of optimizations? And is there any sign of new workload deployments taking place? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Thanks. Good questions. On Gemini, obviously, it's effort from our combined Google DeepMind team. I'm very excited at the progress there and as we're working through getting the model ready. To me, more importantly, we are just really laying the foundation of what I think of as the next generation series of models we'll be launching throughout 2024. The pace of innovation is extraordinarily impressive to see. We are creating it from the ground-up to be multimodal, highly efficient tool and API integrations and more importantly, laying the platform to enable future innovations as well. And we are developing Gemini in a way that it is going to be available at various sizes and capabilities, and we'll be using it immediately across all our products internally as well as bringing it out to both developers and cloud customers through Vertex. So I view it as a journey and each generation is going to be better than the other, and we are definitely investing and the early results are very promising. On Cloud, maybe what I would say is, overall, we had definitely started seeing customers looking to optimize spend. We leaned into it to help customers given some of the challenges they were facing. And so that was a factor. But we are definitely seeing a lot of interest in AI. There are many, many projects underway now, just on Vertex alone, the number of projects grew over 7x. And so we see signs of stabilization, and I'm optimistic about what's ahead. Doug Anmuth : Thank you, Sundar. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan : Thank you, sir, very much for taking the questions. Two, if I could. Sundar, you guys led over a year ago, starting with Performance Max. And I wanted to know if we could get your updated thoughts on how AI might impact the broader advertising industry and how you're aligning Alphabet in Google's goals with AI and where it might take the advertising industry in the years ahead? That would be the first question. And then about a year ago, Philipp and Ruth started talking about some of the brand advertising headwinds that YouTube was facing. As we start to lap those headwinds, how should we be thinking about a broad recovery in brand advertising versus elements of still headwinds that are being faced in the broader ad space, specifically with YouTube? Thank you. Philipp Schindler : So maybe I take the first one. We're very pleased with how Performance Max is performing. It gives advertisers really maximum performance across all inventory from, one, really AI-powered campaign, and it's probably the ultimate example of AI in action across our ads product. It's delivering excellent ROI. Those using it achieve like on average, over 18% more conversions at a similar cost per action. So since rolling it out about two years ago, we've continued to expand the features, give advertisers additional ways to steer how it works. There are a lot of things like account level, negative keywords, other details here. We launched new life cycle goals, customer life cycle goals, we call them revamped asset creation flow. That really helps business adapt and scale the most successful creatives. I think that's one to watch. We will also continue to build other new PMax features based on all the advertiser feedback we're seeing. So we're very, very encouraged by the progress here. Overall, maybe there was a second part to your question a bit on what we're hearing from the customers out there, look, driving ROI and efficiency is still top of mind for many, right? It's a rapidly shifting and still quite unpredictable consumer landscape out there. Our AI tools are very well received. AI, Gen AI are top of mind for everybody, really. There's a ton of excitement, lots of questions about it. Many understand the value. Nearly 80% of our advertisers already use at least one AI-powered search ads product. And yeah, we're hearing a lot of good feedback on, number one, our ads AI essentials, which are really helping to unlock the power of AI and set up for durable ROI growth on the advertiser side. This is -- those are products like the foundation for data and measurement, things like Google Tag, Consent Mode and so on. And obviously, Search and PMax we talked about it and then all the Gen AI products, all those different ones. So there's a whole lot of interest in those products, yeah. Ruth Porat : And then on to your second question regarding YouTube, as we said, overall year-on-year growth in revenues was driven by both brand advertising and direct response. But very much to your question, yes, there was a stabilization in spending by advertisers. We're really pleased about that. We're particularly pleased about the ongoing performance in the Living Room and on Shorts. And as I said, that's both watch time growth and monetization I'd say the other thing benefiting YouTube is the retail strength we talked about with Search, retail strength in APAC in both Search and YouTube, and that really began in the second quarter, continued in the third quarter, but that was another contributor. So quite a number of things going on. I feel good about the results the team was able to deliver here. Eric Sheridan : Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two, if I can, First, as we just think about the rollout of SGE across the user base, like how far along is that? And how do you balance the product rollout and consumer uptake versus monetization in that transition? And then the second one, also sort of Generative AI related. How quickly are you guys finding new ways of optimizing whether that's shrinking model sizes, chip efficiencies or anything else? And do you think overall capital intensity of the business scales up or do you just find ways to do this more efficiently as usage scales? Anything you could share there would be great. Thanks. Sundar Pichai : On the first part about SGE, we are still in a very -- very early days in terms of how much we have rolled it out, but we have definitely gotten it out to enough people in both geographically across user segments and enough to know that the product is working well. It improves the experience and -- but there are areas to improve, which we are fine tuning. Our true north here is getting at the right user experience we want to and pretty comfortable seeing the trajectory. And we've always worked through these transitions, be it from desktop to mobile, or from now mobile to an AI-enhanced experience. And so it's nothing new, and I feel very comfortable that as we go through it, the strength of our teams, both on the organic side as well as ad side to drive the right experience for users, including ads will pay dividends. So -- and I think we'll continue to make improvements and make progress there. On your second question, at a high level, I would say, all through the -- we just celebrated 25 years and of all the things I was proud about when I looked at the strength of the work we have done across our infrastructure as a company, our technical infrastructure as a company and various given stages at a given moment in time, when we adopted new generations of technology, we have looked at the cost of it. But then the curves, the efficiency curves we have driven on top of it has always been phenomenal to see. And I see the current moment is no different. Already through this year, we are driving significant efficiencies, both in our models, in training costs and serving costs and our ability to adapt what's needed to the right use case. And so I think we'll do everything that is needed to make sure we have the leading AI models and infrastructure in the world, bar none, and will continue driving efficiencies from there. Lloyd Walmsley : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Michael Nathanson : Thank you. I'm going to ask you guys a multipart question on YouTube TV. So firstly, what were the broader objectives for getting Sunday Ticket? How does it perform versus those objectives? What lessons have you learned from having the NFL Sunday Ticket and how does that affect your appetite for more sports going forward? Thanks. Philipp Schindler : So, as Sundar said earlier, we're several weeks into our first season, and we're very pleased with how it's going, I think, in the broader context, you have to look at it as overall a YouTube subscription strategy. The great feedback we've gotten so far on the YouTube experience is very, very significant. People love the navigation. They love multi-view, they love the chats and the poles and frankly, people are very happy with the lack of latency here. The number one piece of concrete feedback the team has gotten is actually that people want the ability to pick their own games from multi-view which is -- multi-view is the awesome feature, we started rolling out on YouTube TV that gives fans the ability to basically watch multiple streams here at once. And yeah, overall, the teams are working hard to build a fantastic experience, and we are really trying to stay focused on getting our first season right and providing the best possible experience really for fans here. Michael Nathanson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Great. Thanks. A couple of questions on Q4. Can you provide any color on if there's been any pause in advertising around the Middle East conflict in October, anything we should be aware of for Q4? And then second, when we do think about the Sunday Ticket impact, I know you can't give us revenues or expenses, but overall, would that be a headwind to margins in Q4 or something we should be thinking about? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So, look, on your -- on the first question, obviously, this is a tragic, tragic -- there are no words to talk about what's going on. And all of our focus has been on supporting our people there and how our products can be as helpful as possible in this very painful time, broadly. And so nothing really to add. And then in terms of the second question, Sunday Ticket, the only thing I tried to call out there is that clearly, this is the first full quarter of Sunday Ticket that is contributing overall to the subscription revenues that we see. That's in part of other revenues also, obviously, is contributing to higher CAC in the fourth quarter. So try to make that really clear. And as we look longer term, we expect to generate an attractive return over the life of the deal. We're continuing to invest in support of this and excited about the additional opportunities that come out of it, working with partners to deliver clips and other opportunities. As we've said, we've heard positive feedback from our partners at the NFL about the new features and live stream reliability. And this is really a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with excellence at scale and really leverage a lot of the extraordinary magic at YouTube and across Google, and that's what we're excited about. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Ken Gawrelski : Thank you so much. Two questions, if I may. First, how do you think about the future -- the future structure of AI-driven search capabilities? Will activity remain centralized in a Search bar or will it be decentralized and present in many different applications, including on third-party applications? You alluded to Bard being integrated into multiple Google experiences early in the call. And then the second question is, any update on the Chrome cookie deprecation plan to begin in 1Q '24. What have you seen so far based on your early testing of privacy sandbox and what advertiser feedback have you received? Sundar Pichai : On your first question, look, I broadly think of it as people are looking for information. They always look for it in many, many different ways. We've given the product search example. People can directly go to Amazon as an example or come to Google. So if you zoom back and take an information view of the world, there's always been many different ways to get it. And part of our work we do in making Search be world-class and give users what they're looking for so that we can get it as much of that intent as possible. So I don't see that changing. With mobile, there were more ways people could get information, but we worked out to make Search work better in the mobile world. And similarly, a view with AI, there'll be many ways people get information, but it also offers us an opportunity in Search and in Assistant to take it to the next level and answer use cases, which we couldn't have done before and expand the diverse set of needs where we are sourced. So that's how I see the opportunity ahead. Philipp Schindler : And to the second part of your question, yes, Chrome still plans to begin phasing out third-party cookies in the second half of '24. In the last several months, Chrome has really made significant progress on the privacy sandbox with APIs for developer testing, and they're not generally available in Chrome. Our ads team is testing these APIs. And as we shared back in April, the preliminary results of our interspace ads testing showed that a combination of what we call privacy preserving signals and AI optimization actually provides positive results for businesses preparing for a cookie-less future. We also recently announced that in Q1 of '24, we plan to deprecate third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users, and this will support developers, obviously, in conducting their real-world experiments to assess the readiness and effectiveness of their products in this -- without third-party cookies. And we're overall encouraged by the ecosystem engagement on privacy sandbox. We'll continue to work with the industry and regulators in how these technologies can support the transition to, frankly, a more private web. Ken Gawrelski : Thank you. Operator : And our last question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Thank you. Two questions, please. Ruth, you talked about these elevated levels of investments in Q4 and in '24. I'm sorry, were you referring to just CapEx or CapEx and total expenses? And then on the comments around stabilization in Cloud, is this something that you just started to see in the September quarter? Or had you seen that starting earlier in the year? And if you just started seeing in the September quarter, would you have any thoughts on why you would have seen it like Google Cloud would have seen it maybe later than some of the other hyperscalers? Thank you. Ruth Porat : So I think what you're referring to is my CapEx comment. I was trying to make the point that we are committed to meaningfully investing in CapEx, given all the opportunities we see. We do continue to expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. It it will be increasing in the fourth quarter and talked about some of the difference in timing, muted timing in the third quarter due to the timing of supplier payments and then try to make it clear that we will continue to grow CapEx in 2024 or more specifically to your question, 2024 aggregate CapEx will be above the full year 2023. So that was the main one. And then as it relates to Cloud, as Sundar said, what we're really excited about is the revenue growth does reflect healthy customer adoption across the portfolio, and that's infrastructure, data analytics, security. And so we\u2019re -- I can't comment on others, but we feel good about where we're sitting here and looking forward, and we'll let you do the forecasting. DCP growth in the third quarter was above the growth rate for Cloud overall, and we feel really good about the work that they're doing there. And then, of course, in addition to that is all of the contribution from Google Workspace. Mark Mahaney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks. Jim Friedland : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again in our fourth quarter 2023 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. James Friedland : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors discussed in our upcoming Form 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2023. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Hello, everyone. Our results reflect strong momentum and product innovation continuing into 2024. Today, I'm going to talk about four main topics. One, our investments in AI, including how it's helping Search; two, subscriptions, which reached $15 billion in annual revenue, up 5x since 2019. Subscriptions is growing strongly powered by YouTube Premium and Music, YouTube TV and Google One. Three, Cloud, which crossed $9 billion in revenues this quarter and saw accelerated growth driven by our GenAI and product leadership; and four, our investments and focus to meet the growth opportunities ahead. First, AI and Search. As you know, we have long led the way in using AI to improve many of our products from Search to Ads to most of our consumer and enterprise products, helping billions of people already. Last year brought new excitement around GenAI, and I'm proud of how we responded responsibly with deep advances in foundation models and a number of great launches. We closed the year by launching the Gemini era, a new industry-leading series of models that will fuel the next generation of advances. Gemini is the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind, bringing together our 2 world-class research teams. It's engineered to understand and combine text, images, audio, video and code in a natively multimodal way, and it can run on everything from mobile devices to data centers. Gemini gives us a great foundation. It's already demonstrating state-of-the-art capabilities, and it's only going to get better. Gemini Ultra is coming soon. The team is already working on the next versions and bringing it to our products. That starts with Search. We are already experimenting with Gemini in Search, where it's making our Search Generative Experience, or SGE, faster for users. We have seen a 40% reduction in latency in English in the U.S. I'm happy with what we are seeing in the earliest days of SGE. It's available through Search Labs in 7 languages. By applying generative AI to Search, we are able to serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives. People are finding it particularly useful for more complex questions like comparisons or longer queries. It's also helpful in areas where people are looking for deeper understanding, such as education or even gift ideas. We are improving satisfaction, including answers for more conversational and intricate queries. As I mentioned earlier, we are surfacing more links with SGE and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page, and we'll continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users and send valuable traffic to publishers. Beyond SGE, we are continuing to use AI to make searching more accessible and intuitive. Circle to Search lets you search what you see on Android phones with a simple gesture without switching apps. It's available starting this week on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro and the new Samsung Galaxy S24 Series. And Lens now offers generative AI overviews. You can add text to a visual search to ask questions about anything you see and get AI-powered insights in the moment. In addition to Search, we are also seeing a lot of interest in our AI-powered solutions for advertisers. That includes our new conversational experience that uses Gemini to accelerate the creation of Search campaigns. Then there is Bard, our conversational AI tool that complements Search. It's now powered by Gemini Pro and is much more capable at things like understanding, summarizing, reasoning, coding and planning. It's now in over 40 languages and over 230 countries around the world. Looking ahead, we'll be rolling out an even more advanced version for subscribers powered by Gemini Ultra. That's a good segue to subscriptions. As I said earlier, it's now a $15 billion business annually. YouTube is the key driver of our subscription revenues. Available in over 100 countries and regions, YouTube Music and Premium have real momentum. They're engaging passionate users and driving great returns for the music industry and creators. YouTube TV is also doing well. We've had great consumer feedback on the viewing experience. People love the navigation, multiview and unlimited DVR. NFL Sunday Ticket has found its perfect home on YouTube, and Philipp will talk about that more. Let me also talk about our subscription service, Google One. It's doing incredibly well with strong user growth. It provides expanded storage, unlocks exclusive features in Google products and allows us to build a strong relationship with our most engaged users. Google One is growing very well, and we are just about to cross 100 million subscribers. From here, we are going to bring in more AI features and look forward to more strong growth to come. Next, Google Cloud. Throughout 2023, we introduced thousands of product advances, including broad GenAI capabilities across our AI infrastructure, our Vertex AI platform and our new Duet AI agents. In Q4, our product and GenAI leadership enabled us to win and expand relationships with many leading brands, including Hugging Face, McDonald's, Motorola Mobility and Verizon. Google Cloud offers our AI Hypercomputer, a groundbreaking supercomputing architecture that combines our powerful TPUs and GPUs, AI software and multi-slice and multi-host technology to provide performance and cost advantages for training and serving models. Customers like Anthropic, Character.AI, Essential AI and Mistral AI are building and serving models on it. For developers building GenAI applications, we offer Vertex AI, a comprehensive enterprise AI platform. It helps customers like Deutsche Telekom and Moody's discover, customize, augment and deploy over 130 GenAI models, including PaLM, MedPaLM, Sec-PaLM and Gemini as well as popular open source and partner models. Vertex AI has seen strong adoption with the API request increasing nearly 6x from H1 to H2 last year. Using Vertex AI, Samsung recently announced its Galaxy S24 Series smartphone with Gemini and Imagen 2, our advanced text-to-image model. Shutterstock has added Imagen 2 to their AI image generator, enabling users to turn simple text prompts into unique visuals. And Victoria's Secret & Co. will look to personalize and improve the customer experience with Gemini, Vertex AI, Search and Conversations. Customers are increasingly choosing Duet AI, our packaged AI agents for Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform, to boost productivity and improve their operations. Since its launch, thousands of companies and more than 1 million trusted testers have used Duet AI. It will incorporate Gemini soon. In Workspace, Duet AI is helping employees benefit from improved productivity and creativity at thousands of paying customers around the world, including Singapore Post, Uber and Woolworths. In Google Cloud Platform, Duet AI assists software developers and cybersecurity analysts. Duet AI for Developers is the only GenAI offering to support the complete development and operations life cycle, fine-tuned with the customer's own core purpose and policies. It's helping Wayfair, GE Appliances and Commerzbank write better software, faster with AI code completion, code generation and chat support. With Duet AI and Security Operations, we are helping cybersecurity teams at Fiserv, Spotify and Pfizer. Our robust growth has been driven by strong direct and indirect channels. With ISVs, we have nearly tripled the number of co-sell deals from 2022 to 2023. In our ecosystem, there are nearly 90,000 Google Cloud GenAI-enabled consultants. And Accenture has teamed up with Google Cloud to create a joint generative AI center of excellence. Next, let me turn to our focus and discipline as we pursue the opportunities ahead. Search, YouTube and Cloud are supported by our state-of-the-art compute infrastructure. This infrastructure is also key to realizing our big AI ambitions. It's a major differentiator for us. We continue to invest responsibly in our data centers and compute to support this new wave of growth in AI-powered services for us and for our customers. Through this, we are being disciplined in how we run the company. You've heard me talk about our efforts to durably reengineer our cost base and to improve our velocity and efficiency. That work continues. Teams are working to focus on key priorities and execute fast, removing layers and simplifying their organizational structures. As just one example, our devices team has brought together different teams from across Nest, Fitbit and other teams into a new functional structure. This will help us pull resources and drive progress across our Pixel portfolio. Across different teams, we have wound down some nonpriority projects, which will help us invest and operate well in our growth areas. We are also improving our machine utilization, building on our years of experience in driving cost efficiencies in our computing infrastructure and operations. And through our supplier efficiency efforts and automation of certain processes, we have made major improvements in areas like procurement, achieving significant savings. That's a snapshot of the quarter. Before I close, a couple of other highlights. Pixel 8, our AI-first phone, was awarded Phone of the Year by numerous outlets. It now uses Gemini Nano with features like Magic Compose for Google Messages and more to come. In our Other Bets portfolio of companies, Waymo, which is deeply focused on safety, reached over 1 million fully autonomous ride-hailing trips. And Isomorphic Labs entered into strategic partnerships with Eli Lilly and Novartis to apply AI to treat diseases, which has great potential. 2023 was a year of profound innovation and product momentum. Thank you to our many partners. We succeed when our partners do, and we are grateful for the work we do together. From our partners across the Android ecosystem who are on display at CES to our deep relationships with retailers, small businesses and advertising partners, to the next generation of AI start-ups and developers and many more. I also want to thank all of our employees for their hard work throughout 2023 and the start of the new year. I'm excited for what's ahead in 2024. Philipp? Philipp Schindler : Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. Google Services revenues of $76 billion were up 12% year-on-year. In Google advertising, Search and other revenues grew 13% year-on-year, led again by solid growth in the retail vertical. We had particular strength in retail in APAC, a trend that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through the end of the year. YouTube ads revenue were up 16% year-on-year driven by growth in both direct response and brand. And network revenues declined 2% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms and devices, which was previously named Google Other, year-on-year revenues increased 23% driven by strong growth in subscriptions. Now for some color on the quarter and where we see continued upside for long-term advertising growth. Over the last few calls, I have consistently highlighted how we're putting Google AI to work for our customers to deliver profitability and help them achieve their goals in a do-more-with-less environment. From a product perspective, in Q4, Performance Max remained a bright spot. We're also excited about demand gen momentum. This is our big bet to help social advertisers find and convert consumers via immersive, relevant visual creatives across YouTube, including YouTube Shorts, Gmail and Discover. In a single campaign, you get access to over 3 billion users as they stream, scroll, connect and decide what to buy. Tens of thousands of advertisers are testing and on average seeing 6% more conversions per dollar versus image-only ads and discovery campaigns. As we look ahead, we're also starting to put generative AI in the hands of more and more businesses to help them build better campaigns and even better performing ads. Automatically created assets help advertisers show more relevant search ads by creating tailored headlines and descriptions based on each ad's context. Adoption was up with strong feedback in Q4. In addition to now being available in 8 languages, more advanced GenAI-powered capabilities are coming to ACA. And then last week's big news was that Gemini will power new conversational experience in Google Ads. This is open and beta to U.S. and U.K. advertisers. Early tests show advertisers are building higher-quality search campaigns with less effort, especially SMBs who are 42% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength. We can't wait to see how this continues to drive performance and level the playing field for advertisers of all sizes. As we shared last quarter, Ads will continue to play an important role in the new search experience, and we'll continue to experiment with new formats native to SGE. SGE is creating new opportunities for us to improve commercial journeys for people by showing relevant ads alongside search results. We've also found that people are finding ads either above or below the AI-powered overview helpful as they provide useful options for people to take action and connect with businesses. Looking at our strong Search performance for the fourth quarter. Retail was a highlight. We continue to see a stronger start to the season up to and including Cyber Five. In Q3, we indicated that we were seeing early trends of consumers being very price-conscious, and we saw this play out in Q4. With promotional demand at an all-time high, deal seekers using Google had access to 2x the deals in the U.S. versus last season as well as a better shopping experience. Launches included a one-stop shop deals destination, new filters like [ Get it Fast ] and AI-generated gifting recommendations in SGE. These new features drove incremental query growth during key shopping moments like Cyber Five. Our proven AI-powered ad solutions were also a win for retailers looking to accelerate omni growth and capture holiday demand. Quick examples include a large U.S. big-box retailer who drove a 60%-plus increase in omni ROAS and a 22%-plus increase in store traffic using Performance Max during Cyber Five; and a well-known global fashion brand, who drove a 15%-plus higher omnichannel conversion rate versus regular shopping traffic by showcasing its store pickup offering across top markets through pickup later on shopping ads. Moving on to YouTube. We're obviously pleased with YouTube's advertising revenue growth in Q4 and also significant growth in our subscription revenue. I'll reiterate what I have said before : YouTube's success starts with creator success. We give millions of creators more ways to create content and connect with fans and more ways to make money and build their own businesses than any other platform. More creators means more content, which leads to more viewers. And via ads and subscriptions, these viewers fund our creators and drive the eyeballs and engagement our advertisers want. To keep this momentum going, we're focused on delivering value across 4 pillars : creation, viewers, monetization and responsibility. First, creation, which increasingly takes place on mobile devices. We've invested in a full suite of tools, including our new YouTube Create app for Shorts, to help people make everything from 15-second Shorts to 15-minute videos to 15-hour live streams with a production studio in the palm of their hands. GenAI is supercharging these capabilities. Anyone with a phone can swap in a new backdrop, remove background extras, translate their video into dozens of languages, all without a big studio budget. We're excited about our first products in this area from Dream Screen for AI-generated backgrounds to Aloud for AI-powered dubbing. There is more to come. Number two, viewers. We continue to grow watch time across YouTube with strong growth in Shorts and connected TV. Shorts remains a top priority. We have 2 billion-plus logged-in users every month, and we are averaging 70 billion in daily views. Connected TVs, or what we refer to as the living room, is where viewership is growing the fastest. We're investing to make this experience even better with interactive features tailored to TVs, plus the content people love : our creators, NFL Sunday Ticket and the range of live sports and studio content via YouTube TV and Primetime Channels. Put this all together and YouTube is the must-have app on every connected TV. Monetization is pillar #3 and realized through a combination of ad-supported and subscription offerings. Advertising generates the bulk of our revenue, and we continue to invest heavily here. We've rolled out CTV-first formats like 30-second nonskippable ads and pause experiences as well as an industry-first send-to-phone experience that lets people use a second screen to engage with ads. For Shorts, we've developed new formats that are less interruptive to viewers. It's early. We're learning but excited by the opportunities for ads this can unlock. Shorts monetization continues to progress nicely. Our AI-powered video formats from video reach and video view campaigns to demand gen and video action continue to make advertiser dollars go further and drive results across the funnel. We're also introducing new and existing advertisers to YouTube via sports content. 90-plus upfront and scatter advertisers, including Unilever, are partnering with YouTube in our first year across NFL Sunday Ticket in-game advertising opportunities. Our subscription offerings are also growing at a healthy clip. YouTube Music and Premium performed well. Premium users are delivering more value to our partners and YouTube than even ad-supported users do. On average, each additional Premium sign-up boost earnings for creators, music and media partners and YouTube itself. And we've made Premium even more attractive with new features, bundles and other enhancements. We're also pleased with our first season of NFL Sunday Ticket. It gave creators new opportunities to create content and feed user engagement across traditional user content and professional sports content. Feedback on the user experience, including multiview, has been great. We're excited to continue to innovate here. Responsibility is our fourth pillar, and it underlines everything we do across YouTube. We continue to focus relentlessly on this. As always, deepening our relationships with key partners to bring them the best of Google is a key priority for us, and we continue to do this across industries in Q4. We just talked about the NFL. Sundar mentioned Samsung, among others earlier. Another highlight was our expanded partnership with Porsche to enhance customers' digital experiences with a deeper in-vehicle integration of Google built-in services, including Google Maps and Play. Whether it's continued collaboration with our partners and key ecosystems, we're putting Google AI to work for more customers. I'm excited about the opportunities for continued impact in 2024. I'll wrap with a huge note of gratitude to our customers and partners. Our success is only possible because of their success and then to our Googlers for their outstanding work and focus this year. Ruth, over to you. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our full year results with 2023 Alphabet revenues of $307 billion, up 9% versus 2022, which added $25 billion to revenues for the year. We ended with a strong fourth quarter with consolidated revenues of $86.3 billion, up 13% versus last year in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. Total cost of revenues was $37.6 billion, up 6%. Other cost of revenues was $23.6 billion, up 5%, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs associated with YouTube subscription offerings. The growth rate also reflects the offsetting benefit of lapping $1.2 billion in inventory-related charges that we called out in the fourth quarter last year as well as a reduction in depreciation expense due to changes in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of 2023. In terms of total expenses, the year-on-year comparisons reflect an additional $1.2 billion in exit charges that we took in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with actions to optimize our global office space. As you can see in our earnings release, these charges were allocated across the expense lines in other cost of revenues and OpEx based on associated head count. Operating expenses were $25 billion, up 11%, primarily reflecting an increase in R&D expenses, which were driven by the real estate charges, followed by compensation. Operating income was $23.7 billion, up 30%, and our operating margin was 27%. Net income was $20.7 billion, and EPS was $1.64. We delivered free cash flow of $7.9 billion, which was affected by the timing of the $10.5 billion tax payment we made on October 16 that we called out previously related to the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter. For the full year 2023, free cash flow was $69 billion. We repurchased a total of $62 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in 2023 and ended the year with $111 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $76.3 billion, up 12%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $48 billion in the quarter were up 13%, led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $9.2 billion were up 16% driven by both direct response and brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $8.3 billion were down 2%. Subscriptions, platforms and devices revenues, which we previously referred to as other revenues, were $10.8 billion, up 23%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues. TAC was $14 billion, up 8%. Google Services' operating income was $26.7 billion, up 32%, and the operating margin was 35%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $9.2 billion for the quarter, up 26%. We're very pleased with the momentum of GCP with an increasing contribution from AI. Google Workspace also delivered strong revenue growth primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $864 million and an operating margin of 9%. As to our Other Bets, for the full year 2023, revenues were $1.5 billion and the operating loss was $4.1 billion. Results in the fourth quarter benefited from a milestone payment in one of the Other Bets. Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within advertising. We were pleased with the sequential revenue growth of Search and YouTube advertising throughout 2023, which reflects the extraordinary work across our teams to drive improved experiences for users and attractive ROI for advertisers. As we enter 2024 with advertising revenues of more than $100 billion higher than 2019, we remain focused on sustaining healthy growth on this larger base. Second, within subscriptions, platforms and devices, our total revenues from subscription products reached $15 billion for the full year 2023 driven primarily by substantial growth in subscribers for our YouTube subscription offerings. The substantial increase in our subscription revenues over the past few years demonstrates the ability of our teams to deliver high value-add offerings and provides a strong base on which to build, including through YouTube and newer services like Google One. Play had solid growth again in the fourth quarter driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers. In devices, we continue to make sizable investments with increased emphasis on our Pixel family, particularly with AI-powered innovation while driving further efficiencies across the portfolio. Turning to Google Cloud. We are pleased with operating performance in the year. Full year revenues of $33 billion were up 26% versus prior year, ending with strong Q4 performance. The Cloud team is intensely focused on bringing the benefits of Gemini, our industry-leading AI technology, to enterprises and governments globally, and we are gratified with the level of engagement. The strong demand we are seeing for our vertically integrated AI portfolio is creating new opportunities for Google Cloud across every product area. In terms of profitability, the improvement in 2023 reflects sustained focus across the team with the intent to maintain healthy profitability while we continue to invest to support long-term growth. Turning to margins and expenses. As we have repeatedly stressed, we remain committed to our framework to durably reengineer our cost base as we invest to support our growth priorities. Key contributors to moderating our expense growth include : first, product and process prioritization to ensure we have the right resources behind our most important opportunities and to reallocate resources where we can; second, organizational efficiency and structure. We're focused on removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity. Both product prioritization and the organization design efforts result in a slower pace of hiring, as you can see with our head count down year-on-year, reflecting the reductions we announced in the first quarter of 2023 and a much slower pace of hiring. We will continue to invest in top technical and engineering talent. Finally, we continue to execute the other work streams to slow expense growth, including improving efficiency in our technical infrastructure, streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI, increasing efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization and optimizing our real estate portfolio. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the fourth quarter was $11 billion, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. The step-up in CapEx in Q4 reflects our outlook for the extraordinary applications of AI to deliver for users, advertisers, developers, cloud enterprise customers and governments globally and the long-term growth opportunities that offers. In 2024, we expect investment in CapEx will be notably larger than in 2023. With regard to Other Bets, we've been working to sharpen our investment focus while capturing the upside given compelling technology breakthroughs across the portfolio. For example, last week, Alphabet's X announced that it would be moving to spin out more projects as independent companies through external capital, giving X the opportunity to bring more focus to the breakthrough technologies it is working on to address some of the world's most pressing challenges. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have two for Philipp. Philipp, the first one is about sort of a lot of the new generative AI advertising tools. You obviously have a lot of irons in the fire here. You've been talking about some of the early momentum with tens of thousands of advertisers. The question is, can you sort of walk us through some of the hurdles and gating factors that we should be thinking through that dictate the pace at which these tools can really be rolled out broadly just so we and advertisers can kind of get an understanding for when they could have a bigger impact on the whole business? And then secondly, how do you think about the long-term sales force intensity of the advertising business as you roll more AI-based tools like PMax impacting the overall ad allocation? Philipp Schindler : Yes. Thank you so much. So I've covered this a little bit on previous quarters. AI has been at the core of our advertising products for a very, very long time. And the recent advances are really allowing us to drive more value for advertisers across a large range of different areas : bidding, targeting, creative as well as our core advertiser and publisher experiences. We are seeing in core search ads, for example, the bidding side, the value-based bidding as a very significant one; on the targeting side, the broad match; on creative, responsive search ads automatically created ads assets. And we are very happy with the progress we're seeing in those areas.  I think I mentioned in one of the previous calls that one, you asked about hurdles and gating factors. The AI essentials play neutral in this, trying to get everybody ready to really take full advantage of those tools. We talked about the progress on PMax as well that we're very happy with in Q4. So overall, I think we are on track with what we're expecting here.  On the sales force intensity side, we have done a few reallocations or let me call it portfolio adjustments. As you know, we have 2 large different teams. One is our LCS, large customer solutions team that's really focused on transformational growth for our largest and most sophisticated customers. And we have our -- we call them GCS, Global Customer Solutions team, which is the channel where really every customer starts from some of our largest customers now to also the millions of smaller ones and SMBs. The GCS is really then scaling growth by dynamically delivering really the right treatment for every customer. And important to note, it's also our fastest-growing channel, and it delivered particularly strong growth in Q4. So we have done adjustments here to focus more resources on the GCS side.  But I also want to be clear, when we restructure, there's always an opportunity to be more efficient and smarter in how we service and grow our customers. We're not restructuring because AI is taking away roles that's important here. But we see significant opportunities here with our AI-powered solution to actually deliver incredible ROI at scale, and that's why we're doing some of those adjustments. So I look at sales force intensity as a stronger focus going forward on the channels I mentioned here. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : One for Ruth and one for Philipp. Ruth, you're now into year 2 of durably reengineering your cost structure. Can you just help us assess your progress so far? And are there any guideposts that we should be thinking about going forward? And then Philipp, can you talk more about NFL Sunday Ticket and just what your key learnings were in year 1? How are you thinking about the returns on the investment on both from an advertising perspective and then also subscribers to both Sunday Ticket and YouTube TV? Ruth Porat : Thanks for the question. So we are very pleased with the progress we're continuing to make, and we are very committed to the framework to durably reengineer our cost base really as we're investing to support the growth priorities. I tried to call out a number of them in opening comments, but really, as you're looking at the work being done across Google, across Alphabet, it does start with product and process prioritization to make sure we've got the right resources behind the most important opportunities, and then that creates the opportunity for reallocating resources where we can.  Then we talked a lot about this quarter about organizational efficiency and structure, and we're focused on removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity. The combination of those 2, product prioritization and organizational design work, has resulted in the slower pace of hiring. You can see that in our head count numbers down year-on-year. You can see it in some of the -- in the results that we delivered in the fourth quarter.  You can -- and it also goes to the announcements around first quarter and much lower pace of hiring. At this point in the quarter, we do estimate that severance-related expense will be roughly $700 million in the first quarter as we've continued these efforts. But as I said in opening comments, we will continue to invest in top engineering. So that's sort of the big one, if you start with product prioritization and organizational design, which is why also I made the note about the severance-related expense, which helps pave the way as we're continuing to do the work that we're doing. But then we have a host of other work streams, which I talked about, everything with improving efficiency in our technical infrastructure, which is a very large ongoing effort; streamlining operations across Alphabet through use of AI; all the work we're doing with our suppliers and vendors; the work we're doing optimizing our real estate portfolio. So when we've described durably reengineering, it's about continuing to build on work that started, and that is ongoing. Philipp Schindler : So on the NFL Sunday Ticket side, look, as I said earlier, NFL Sunday Ticket supports our long-term strategy and really help solidify YouTube's position as a must-have app on everyone's TV set.  You asked about some of the learnings. Maybe I'll start with the viewing experience. We've received great feedback so far. People like the navigation, multiview, the chat, the lack of latency, really, really positive feedback on this one. You asked about the ads and the subs. Maybe I'll start with the subscribers. We're pleased with the NFL Sunday Ticket sign-ups in our first season both as part of the YouTube TV bundle and as a stand-alone offering on YouTube Primetime Channels. Remember, you can access them via both. Nothing more to share on the sub side today on this one.  On the ad side, as you know, advertisers can buy from an NFL lineup as part of our YouTube Select portfolio. And this actually allows advertisers to reach football fans across YouTube's pretty unique breadth of NFL content, independently of whether you're viewing live NFL games or on YouTube TV or Primetime Channels or watching NFL highlights, post-game commentary on YouTube channels. And we saw solid demand across the ad market around our YouTube Sunday Ticket offering here. We're excited about the partnership ahead or the partnerships ahead. This is our first season. And I mentioned over 90 upfront and scatter advertisers partnered with YouTube in our first year across NFL Sunday Ticket in-game opportunities, which we really appreciate. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Two, if I could. Sundar, a bigger-picture question, coming back to your comments earlier in the call on Search Generative Experience. When you think about the evolution of product over the next couple of years, how do you envision more traditional search and things like the Google Assistant continuing to evolve in a world of Search Generative Experience and Bard? And what that might mean for elements of commercial and noncommercial search and how use cases might change in the years ahead? And then Ruth, I just want to make sure we understood some of the messaging from the release and the public comments around one-timers in the quarter itself. It seems as if they were not allocated to the segments but are more elements of Other Bets and Alphabet-level activities. I just want to confirm whether elements of those one-timers were captured in the P&L statement and whether there were also any elements of legal one-timers that would be called out this quarter as well. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Eric. Great question. Look, it is an exciting time. Clearly, as I said, as we are incorporating SGE in the product, the early feedback is positive. And we've been iterating on it, and it clearly works for certain type of queries very well. We are expanding the set of queries where it works very well. It definitely is answering a certain category of queries for the first time in a better way. So that gives us direction to proceed as well.  Overall, one of the things I think people underestimate about Search is the breadth of Search, the amount of queries we see constantly on a new day, which we haven't seen before. And so the trick here is to deliver that high-quality experience across the breadth of what we see in Search. And over time, we think Assistant will be very complementary. And we will again use generative AI there, particularly with our most advanced models in Bard and allows us to act more like an agent over time, if I were to think about the future and maybe go beyond answers and follow through for users even more. So that is the -- directionally, what the opportunity set is. Obviously, a lot of execution ahead. But it's an area where I think we have a deep sense of what to do. And all the work we have taken so far, the feedback has been super positive. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of your other question, so on the real estate charge of $1.2 billion in exit charges related to real estate, that is in Alphabet-level activities. But the other comment I was making in opening comments is when you go through the various line items, R&D, et cetera, you see it spread there. And we have a table and IR can walk anybody through the technicals on that just to understand how it then gets arrayed across the various lines in the P&L. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Michael Nathanson : I have two for Philipp, I think. Given the importance of connected TV engagement in YouTube, can you talk about the opportunity outside the U.S. for connected TV? And what the company is doing at large to drive more adoption of YouTube or connected TVs given the Google operating system? And can you talk about outside the U.S.? And then you've been consistent about the strength of Shorts over the past year. Can you talk a bit about the modernization challenges? Do you still see the headwinds that you saw at the beginning? Anything you could share about the density of the auction or advertising interest on Shorts. So help us with whether or not that's still a headwind to growth. Philipp Schindler : Yes. Thank you so much for your question. On the connected TV side, I mentioned it actually continues to perform really well. I said before, YouTube is the leader in U.S. streaming watch time and it's not just one audience group diving deep it's really all audiences. On the international side, it's something we are closely looking at. There's nothing specific I have to add at this moment in time on this one.  On the Shorts monetization side, look, we built Shorts to respond to the huge demand from both creators and viewers for short-form video. And we're very pleased with the growth we've seen. I mentioned 2 billion-plus logged-in users every month, 70 billion in daily views. Specifically to the monetization question, Shorts monetization continues to progress nicely. In fact, actually, since we introduced revenue sharing for Shorts, the total creator earnings generated from Shorts have increased every month, and we expect this to continue. And similar, obviously, to our long-form videos, we're really committed here to a long-term partnership. And you heard me say this before, right, when creators succeed, we succeed. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with UBS. Stephen Ju : So Philipp, this is not a new question, but it's also been about 2 years since PMax was launched. But it seems like there's been this long lineage of product development and rollout of things like smart bidding in your history, which I believe at the time was designed to help smaller advertisers more easily run search advertising.  And today, you're helping me to generate creative as well as manage my spend and maximize ROI across multiple Google Services. So how are you feeling about enabling SMBs who otherwise could not advertise with you before? And what kind of TAM expansion tailwind does that create for your revenue growth over the longer term? Philipp Schindler : Look, as you know, SMBs are a huge focus for us. We mentioned this several times before. They're part of our GCS channel, not only there's more in this. But they've been under a ton of change over the last few years. And our focus has always been here on investing in solutions that really help level the playing field, and you mentioned several of those. So actually, SMBs can compete with bigger brands and more sophisticated advertisers.  And so the feedback we're always getting is they need easy solutions that could drive value quickly, and several of the AI-powered solutions that you're mentioning are actually making the workflow and the whole on-ramp and the bidded targeting creative and so on, you mentioned that is so much easier for SMBs. So we're very satisfied with what we're seeing here. We will continue to invest. And I feel AI is really a helpful, very interesting future path to make life not only easier but also much more productive and better ROIs over time, more level playing field for SMBs. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post with BAML. Justin Post : Maybe one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Just on Search growth, I think there are some concerns on use of competitive AI tools as an alternative to Search. Just wondering if you're seeing any changes in query volumes, positive or negative, since you've seen the year evolve and more Search Generative Experiences. And what can really make Google stand out versus other AI tools? And then Ruth, CapEx was $11 billion, a step-up, obviously. Any onetime items in there? Or is that how we should think about the new run rate into '24. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Justin. First of all, look, we think about effects on Search, obviously, more broadly. People have a lot of information choices. So -- and user expectations are constantly evolving. And so we've been doing this for a long time. And I think what ends up mattering is a strong continuous track record of innovation. Obviously, generative AI is a new tool in the arsenal. But there's a lot more that goes into Search : the breadth, the depth, the diversity across verticals, stability to follow through, getting actually access to rich, diverse sources of content on the web and putting it all together in a compelling way.  And I think, through the year 2, when we test, we test Search Generative Experience, particularly against everything that's out there. And we can see the progress we are making and how much users are liking the experience better. And so I think I feel very good about the progress. And our road map for '24 is strong both on the Search and the underlying AI progress, including the model. So I'm pretty excited about what's ahead of us in '24. Ruth Porat : And with respect to CapEx, the CapEx of $11 billion in the fourth quarter, as I indicated, was overwhelmingly investment in our technical infrastructure. To your question, there was no onetime item in there. It really reflects is our outlook for everything Sundar and Philipp and I have been talking about, the extraordinary applications of AI within Google DeepMind, Google Services, Google Cloud, it's across the board for users, for advertisers, developers, cloud enterprise customers, governments. And it's really the long-term opportunity that offers.  So last quarter, we did note that CapEx would continue to grow in 2024. We do expect 2024 full year CapEx to be notably larger than 2023. As a note, I think you all know this, but timing of cash payments can affect the quarterly CapEx number. But the main point is we're continuing to invest. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Ross Sandler : So I guess a question for, I don't know if it's Sundar or Philipp. But if we go back to the DOJ trial that happened in the fall, there was a document that was disclosed from Google that said something along the lines of why being on ad quality team to deliver 20% RPM growth in Search is a fragile strategy. So dating back to 2019, your business has, I think, more than doubled since then.  So I guess, as we sit here today in early 2024, how do you feel about Google's ability to drive Search RPM going forward? And I guess in the context of what Ruth said tonight about the large revenue base, just how do you feel about the monetization? Sundar Pichai : Look, I think I have tremendous confidence in the quality driven both our work, be it search quality, ads quality, our improvements on search, our improvements on ads RPM, all -- 2 foundational pillars are extraordinary focus on ads quality so that we deliver the actual ROI to advertisers and improve the experience for users and all underpinned by rigor and technical excellence and go-to-market excellence, right? So the fundamental attributes don't change. I think AI gives us opportunity both on the organic side as well as on the monetization side. And I think we are in the early days of it. I think we'll be able to, taking a long-term view, serve information needs in a deeper way. And so I think about it in that -- with that long-term context, and I'm pretty excited about what's ahead. Operator : And our last question will be from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Mark Stephen Mahaney : One question on YouTube AI and one on cloud. On cloud first, there's just this volatility, this material deceleration last quarter and the nice reacceleration this quarter. Is that explained by where we are in the optimization cycle, and it may be generative AI workloads starting to trickle in now and cause that growth curve to bend back up? Any commentary just on the sort of the volatility, the deceleration and the reacceleration that we've seen? And then Philipp, I wanted to ask on the creative side, and particularly on YouTube and ads and the creative, using AI to improve the creative and really to offer SMBs who have been with Google forever but offer them now performance-based video ad campaigns created by AI. Is that kind of a new growth area? How far along are you in terms of offering this out into the market? And do you think that this opens up a new area of spend that wasn't there before? Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Mark. On cloud, let me take that. First of all, a combination of factors. I think definitely excitement around the AI solutions on top of our foundational pillar, be it data and analytics, infrastructure, security, et cetera. But AI is definitely something which is driving interest and early adoption. And as you saw that greater than 70% of GenAI unicorns are using Google Cloud. And so I think it's an area where our strengths will continue to play out as we go through '24, especially when I look at innovation ahead from us on the AI front. And second, I think there are regional variations, but the cost optimizations in many parts are something we have mostly worked through. And I think that was a contributing factor as well. Philipp Schindler : So on your YouTube question, maybe let me start with a general view. YouTube's mission, you know, has enabled millions of creators around the world to share their voice and connect with audiences and obviously build thriving businesses here. And AI has been a very critical piece of this already. You are obviously aware of the made YouTube announcement where we introduced a whole lot of new complementary creativity features on YouTube, including Dream Screen, for example, and a lot of other really interesting tools and thoughts. You can obviously imagine that we can take this more actively to the advertising world already. As you know, it continues already to power AI, a lot of our video ad solutions and measurement capabilities. It's part of video-rich campaigns. Multi-format ads are -- actually, there is a generative creator music that actually makes it easier for creators to design the perfect soundtrack already. And as I said earlier, AI will unlock a new world of creativity. And you can see how this will -- if you just look at where models are heading, where multimodal models are heading, where the generation capabilities of those models are heading, you can absolutely see how this will impact and positively impact and simplify the flow for creators, similar to what you see already emerging in some of our core products like ACA on the Search side. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks. James Friedland : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2024 call. Thank you and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. James Friedland : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Ruth Porat. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Jim, and hello, everyone. It was a great quarter led by strong performance from Search, YouTube, and Cloud. Today, I want to share how we are thinking about the business and the opportunity more broadly. Of course, that's heavily focused on AI and Search. Then I'll take you through some highlights from the quarter in Cloud, YouTube and beyond. Let's discuss our momentum and strategy. Taking a step back, it took Google more than 15 years to reach $100 billion in annual revenue. In just the last 6 years, we have gone from $100 billion to more than $300 billion in annual revenue. Of course, Search continues to power that as you see in our Q1 results. But in addition, we expect YouTube overall and Cloud to exit 2024 at a combined annual run rate of over $100 billion. This shows our track record of investing in and building successful new growing businesses. Now let's look at how well we are positioned for the next wave of AI innovation and the opportunity ahead. There are 6 points to make : one, research leadership; two, infrastructure leadership; three, innovation in Search; four, our global product footprint; five, velocity in execution; six, monetization paths. First, our foundation of research leadership. We've been an AI-first company since 2016, pioneering many of the modern breakthroughs that power AI progress for us and for the industry. Last week, we further consolidated teams that build AI models under Google DeepMind. This will help simplify development and establish a single access point for our product teams as they build generative AI applications with these models. The teams are making rapid progress, developing Gemini and other models. In February, we rolled out Gemini 1.5 Pro, which shows dramatic performance enhancements across a number of dimensions. It includes a breakthrough in long context understanding, achieving the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model yet. Combining this with Gemini's native multimodal understanding across audio, video, text code and more, it's highly capable. We are already seeing developers and enterprise customers enthusiastically embrace Gemini 1.5 and use it for a wide range of things. Beyond Gemini, we have built other useful models, including our Gemma open models as well as image and visual models and others. Second, infrastructure leadership. We have the best infrastructure for the AI era. Building world-leading infrastructure is in our DNA, starting in our earliest days when we had to design purpose-built hardware to power Search. Our data centers are some of the most high-performing, secure, reliable, and efficient in the world. They've been purpose-built for training cutting-edge AI models and designed to achieve unprecedented improvements in efficiency. We have developed new AI models and algorithms that are more than 100x more efficient than they were 18 months ago. Our custom TPUs, now in their fifth generation, are powering the next generation of ambitious AI projects. Gemini was trained on and is served using TPUs. We are committed to making the investments required to keep us at the leading edge in technical infrastructure. You can see that from the increases in our capital expenditures. This will fuel growth in Cloud, help us push the frontiers of AI models and enable innovation across our services, especially in Search. AI innovations in Search are the third and perhaps the most important point I want to make. We have been through technology shifts before, to the web, to mobile, and even to voice technology. Each shift expanded what people can do with Search and led to new growth. We are seeing a similar shift happening now with generative AI. For nearly a year, we've been experimenting with SGE in search labs across a wide range of queries. And now we are starting to bring AI overviews to the main Search results page. We are being measured in how we do this, focusing on areas where gen AI can improve the search experience while also prioritizing traffic to websites and merchants. We have already served billions of queries with our generative AI features. It's enabling people to access new information, to ask questions in new ways and to ask more complex questions. Most notably, based on our testing, we are encouraged that we are seeing an increase in search usage among people who use the new AI overviews as well as increased user satisfaction with the results. And with Circle to Search, people can now circle what they see on their Android screens, ask a question about an image or object in a video and get an AI overview with Lens. Fourth, our global product footprint beyond Search. We have 6 products with more than 2 billion monthly users, including 3 billion Android devices. 15 products have 0.5 billion users, and we operate across 100-plus countries. This gives us a lot of opportunities to bring helpful gen AI features and multimodal capabilities to people everywhere and improve their experiences. We have brought many new AI features to Pixel, Photos, Chrome, Messages and more. We are also pleased with the progress we are seeing with Gemini and Gemini Advanced through the Gemini app on Android and the Google app on iOS. Fifth, improved velocity in execution. We've been really focused on simplifying our structures to help us move faster. In addition to bringing together our model-building teams under Google DeepMind, we recently unified our ML infrastructure and ML developer teams to enable faster decisions, smarter compute allocation, and a better customer experience. Earlier this year, we brought our Search teams together under one leader. And last week, we took another step, bringing together our platforms and devices teams. The new combined team will focus on delivering high-quality products and experiences, bolstering the Android and Chrome ecosystems, and bringing our best innovations to partners faster. We also remain focused on long-term efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. You can see the impact of this work reflected in our operating margin improvement. We continue to manage our head count growth and align teams with our highest priority areas. This speeds up decision-making, reduces layers, and enables us to invest in the right areas. Beyond our teams, we are very focused on our cost structures, procurement and efficiency. And a number of technical breakthroughs are enhancing machine speed and efficiency, including the new family of Gemini models and a new generation of TPUs. For example, since introducing SGE about a year ago, machine costs associated with SGE responses have decreased 80% from when first introduced in Labs driven by hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs. We remain committed to all of this work. Finally, our monetization path. We have clear paths to AI monetization through Ads and Cloud as well as subscriptions. Philipp will talk more about new AI features that are helping advertisers, including bringing Gemini models into Performance Max. Our Cloud business continues to grow as we bring the best of Google AI to enterprise customers and organizations around the world. And Google One now has crossed 100 million paid subscribers, and in Q1, we introduced a new AI premium plan with Gemini Advanced. Okay, those are the 6 points so now let me turn to quarterly highlights from Cloud and YouTube in a bit more detail. In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over the past 8 months. At Google Cloud Next, more than 300 customers and partners spoke about their generative AI successes with Google Cloud, including global brands like Bayer, Cintas, Mercedes-Benz, Walmart and many more. Our differentiation in Cloud begins with our AI hypercomputer, which provides efficient and cost-effective infrastructure to train and serve models. Today, more than 60% of funded gen AI start-ups and nearly 90% of gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers. And customers like PayPal and Kakao Brain are choosing our infrastructure. We offer an industry-leading portfolio of NVIDIA GPUs along with our TPUs. This includes TPU v5p, which is now generally available and NVIDIA's latest generation of Blackwell GPUs. We also announced Axion, our new Google design and Arm-based CPU. In benchmark testing, it has performed up to 50% better than comparable x86-based systems. On top of our infrastructure, we offer more than 130 models, including our own models, open source models and third-party models. We made Gemini 1.5 Pro available to customers as well as Imagine 2.0 at Cloud Next. And we shared that more than 1 million developers are now using our generative AI across tools, including AI Studio and Vertex AI. We spoke about how customers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Etsy can quickly and easily build agents and connect them to their existing systems. For example, Discover Financial has begun deploying gen AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers. Customers can also now ground their gen AI with Google Search and their own data from their enterprise databases and applications. In Workspace, we announced that organizations like Uber, Pepperdine University and PennyMac are using Gemini and Google Workspace, our AI-powered agent that's built right into Gmail, Docs sheets and more. We also announced Google Vids, a new application to create stories in short video format. And we introduced Gemini for Meetings and Messaging and Gemini Security for Workspace. Customers are choosing Workspace because they have deep trust in our powerful security and privacy features. Our Cloud business is now widely seen as the leader in cybersecurity. I saw this firsthand when I went to the Munich Security Conference in February. Cybersecurity analysts are using Gemini to help spot threats, summarize intelligence and take action against attacks, helping companies like American Family Insurance aggregate and analyze security data in seconds instead of days. Turning next to YouTube, which continues to grow and lead in streaming. We announced that on average, viewers are watching over 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TVs daily. AI experiments like Dream Screen will give anyone the ability to make AI-generated backgrounds for YouTube Shorts. And on subscriptions, which are increasingly important for YouTube, we announced that in Q1, YouTube surpassed 100 million Music and Premium subscribers globally, including trialers. And YouTube TV now has more than 8 million paid subscribers. Finally, in Other Bets, Waymo's fully autonomous service continues to grow ridership in San Francisco and Phoenix with high customer satisfaction, and we started offering paid rides in Los Angeles and testing rider-only trips in Austin. Overall, it was a great quarter, and there's more to come. IO is in less than 3 weeks, followed by Brandcast and Google Marketing Live. I want to thank our employees around the world who are at the heart of this progress and who continue to focus on building innovative products, helpful services and new opportunities for businesses and partners around the world. Thank you. Philipp? Philipp Schindler : Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. Google Services revenue of $70 billion were up 14% year-on-year. Search and other revenues grew 14% year-on-year led again by solid growth in the retail vertical with particular strength from APAC-based retailers, which began in the second quarter of 2023. YouTube Ads revenues were up 21% year-on-year driven by growth in both direct response and brand. Network revenues declined 1% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms and devices, year-on-year revenues increased 18%, driven again by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions. Let's now talk about a few highlights from the quarter from a product innovation and advertising performance perspective. First, it bears repeating that AI innovation across our Ads ecosystem is core to every aspect of our product portfolio, from targeting, bidding, creative, measurement, and across campaign types. We've talked about whole solutions like Smart Bidding use AI to predict future ad conversions and their value in helping businesses stay agile and responsive to rapid shifts in demand and how products like broad match leverage LLMs to match ads to relevant searches and help advertisers respond to what millions of people are searching for. This is foundational. As advances accelerate in our underlying AI models, our ability to help businesses find users at speed and scale and drive ROI just keeps getting better. We're especially excited about the doors gen AI is opening for creative capabilities, helping deliver on the premise of getting the right ad to the right user in the right moment. Look at Performance Max. In February, we rolled Gemini into PMax. It's helping curate and generate text and image assets so businesses can meet PMax asset requirements instantly. This is available to all U.S. advertisers and starting to roll out internationally in English, and early results are encouraging. Advertisers using PMax asset generation are 63% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength. And those who improve their PMX ad strength to excellent see 6% more conversions on average. We're also driving improved results for businesses opting into automatically created assets, which are supercharged with gen AI. Those adopting ACA see, on average, 5% more conversions at a similar cost per conversion in Search and Performance Max campaigns. And then there's Dimension. Advertisers are loving its ability to engage new and existing customers and drive purchase consideration across our most immersive and visual touch points like YouTube, Shorts, Gmail and Discover. Hollywood film and TV studio, Lionsgate, partnered with Horizon Media to test what campaign type will deliver the most ticketing page views for its The Hunger Games : Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes film. Over a 3-week test, demand gen was significantly more efficient versus social benchmarks with an 85% more efficient CPC and 96% more efficient cost per page view. Lionsgate has since rolled out demand gen for 2 new titles. We're also bringing new creative features to demand gen. Earlier this month, we announced new generative image tools to help advertisers create high-quality assets in a few steps with a few simple prompts. This will be a win for up-leveling visual storytelling and testing creative concepts more efficiently. And then there's obviously Search generative experience, which Sundar talked about. I laid out that innovation and the user experience on Search has historically opened up new opportunities for advertisers. We saw this when we successfully navigated from desktop to mobile. We're continuing to experiment with new ad formats, including search and shopping ads alongside search results in SGE. And we shared in March how folks are finding ads either above or below the SGE results helpful. We're excited to have a solid baseline to keep innovating on and confident in the role SGE, including Ads, will play in delighting users and expanding opportunities to meet user needs. Which brings me to Search and our strong performance in the first quarter. In Q1, retail was again the top contributor. Our focus remains on driving profitability and growth for retailers, helping them optimize digital performance for both online and off-line as well as innovate across our shopping and merchant experiences. Highlights include continued upsides for retailers, leading into agile budget and bidding strategies across Search, PMax, or both; take-home goods retailer IKEA, who leaned into Google's store sales measurement to understand its total omnichannel revenue opportunity across search. By measuring 2.3x more revenue and using value-based bidding solutions to bid to its omnichannel customers, IKEA drove a significant increase in omni revenue in Q1 and is now scaling this strategy globally. We also expanded local inventory ads into 23 countries, helping drive shopper confidence and off-line sales. Retailers can convert intent into action by showcasing in-store availability, pricing, pickup options and more all in one ad format. Moving to YouTube. Last quarter, I went deep into our strategy. It all starts with creation, which drives viewership, which leads to monetization. A few updates to build on Sundar's remarks. First, creation, which is all about giving creators the tools to create amazing content, grow their audiences and build their businesses. In 2023, more people created content on YouTube than ever before, and the number of channels uploading Shorts year-on-year grew 50%. We also hit a new milestone with 3 million-plus channels in our YouTube Partner Program. We recently shared that YPP has paid out more than any other creator monetization platform, including over $70 billion to creators, artists, and media companies over the last 3 years. From a viewer's perspective, watch time across YouTube continues to grow, with strength in both Shorts and CTV. According to Nielsen, YouTube has been the leader in U.S. streaming watch time for the last 12-plus months. In the first quarter, Livingroom. benefited from a combination of strong watch time growth, innovation in the user and advertiser experience, and a shift in brand advertising budgets from linear TV to YouTube. Viewers are watching YouTube because they expect to access everything in one place across screens and formats, their favorite creators, live sports, breaking use, educational content, movies, music and more. And advertisers continue to lean in to find audiences they can't find elsewhere. Which brings me to monetization. We're pleased with our Q1 performance across both our ad-supported and subscription offerings. Sundar covered subscription growth. On the Ads front, direct and brand were both strong this quarter. Shorts monetization continued to improve, with Shorts ads now supported on mobile, tablet, Livingroom. and desktop, and available to both performance and brand advertisers. In the U.S., the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing has more than doubled in the past 12 months, including a 10-point sequential improvement in the first quarter alone. Just last week, we introduced new ways for brands to get the most out of their Shorts ads with new lineups on YouTube Select, including sports, beauty, fashion and lifestyle, and entertainment. For YouTube advertisers, increasing brand lift is one of the core goals. In Q1, we saw strong traction from the introduction of a pause ads pilot on connected TVs, a new non-interruptive ad format that appears when users pause their organic content. Initial results show that pause ads are driving strong brand lift results and are commanding premium pricing from advertisers. Before I wrap, two quick highlights on how we're helping our partners transform and accelerate impact with the best across Google. Number one, to help McDonald's build the restaurant of the future, we're deepening our partnership across cloud and ads. Part of this includes them connecting Google Cloud's latest hardware and data technologies across restaurants globally and starting to apply Gen AI to enhance its customer and employee experiences. Number two, WPP. At Google Cloud Next, we announced a new collaboration that will redefine marketing through the integration of our Gemini models with WPP Open, WPP's AI-powered marketing operating system, already used by more than 35,000 of its people and adopted by key clients, including The Coca-Cola Company, L'Oreal and Nestle. We're just getting started here and excited about the innovation this partnership will unlock. With that, a huge thank you to our customers and partners, many of whom we're excited to see at Google Marketing Live and Brandcast in just a few weeks. And a huge thank you, as always, to our incredible teams for their agility and hard work this quarter. Ruth, you're up. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our financial results for the first quarter driven, in particular, by strength in Search and Cloud as well as the ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $80.5 billion, up 15% or up 16% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of total expenses, the year-on-year comparisons reflect the impact of the restructuring charges we took in the first quarter of 2023 of $2.6 billion as well as the $716 million in employee severance and related charges in the first quarter of 2024. As you can see in our earnings release, these charges were allocated across the expense lines in other cost of revenues and OpEx based on associated head count. To help with year-on-year comparisons, we included a table in our earnings release to adjust other cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income, and operating margin to exclude the impact of severance and related office space charges in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2024. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $33.7 billion, up 10%. Other cost of revenues was $20.8 billion, up 10% on a reported basis, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs associated with YouTube given the very strong revenue growth in both subscription offerings and ad-supported content. On an adjusted basis, other cost of revenues were up 13% year-on-year. Operating expenses were $21.4 billion, down 2% on a reported basis, primarily reflecting expense decreases in sales and marketing and G&A, offset by an increase in R&D. The largest single factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal matters. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses were up 5%, reflecting, first, in R&D, an increase in compensation expense, primarily for Google DeepMind and Cloud; and second, in sales and marketing, a slight increase year-on-year, reflecting increases in compensation expense primarily for Cloud sales. Operating income was $25.5 billion, up 46% on a reported basis, and our operating margin was 32%. On an adjusted basis, operating income was up 31%, and our operating margin was 33%. Net income was $23.7 billion and EPS was $1.89. We delivered free cash flow of $16.8 billion in the first quarter and $69.1 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $108 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $70.4 billion, up 14%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $46.2 billion in the quarter were up 14% led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.1 billion were up 21% driven by both direct response and brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 1%. Subscriptions, platforms and devices revenues were $8.7 billion, up 18%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues. TAC was $12.9 billion, up 10%. Google Services operating income was $27.9 billion, up 28%. And the operating margin was 40%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $9.6 billion for the quarter, up 28%, reflecting significant growth in GCP with an increasing contribution from AI and strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $900 million and an operating margin of 9%. As to our Other Bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $495 million, benefiting from a milestone payment in one of the Other Bets. The operating loss was $1 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within Advertising, we are very pleased with the momentum of our Ads businesses. Search had broad-based strength across verticals. In YouTube, we had acceleration in revenue growth driven by brand and direct response. Looking ahead, two points to call out : first, results in our advertising business in Q1 continued to reflect strength in spend from APAC-based retailers, a trend that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through Q1, which means we will begin lapping that impact in the second quarter; second, the YouTube acceleration in revenue growth in Q1 reflects, in part, lapping the negative year-on-year growth we experienced in the first quarter of 2023. Turning to subscriptions, platforms, and devices. We continue to deliver significant growth in our subscriptions business, which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line. The sequential quarterly decline in year-on-year revenue growth for the line in Q1 versus Q4 reflects, in part, the fact that we had only 1 week of Sunday Ticket subscription revenue in Q1 versus 14 weeks in Q4. Looking forward, we will anniversary last year's price increase in YouTube TV starting in May. With regard to platforms, we are pleased with the performance in Play driven by an increase in buyers. With respect to Google Cloud, performance in Q1 reflects strong demand for our GCP infrastructure and solutions as well as the contribution from our Workspace productivity tools. The growth we are seeing across Cloud is underpinned by the benefit AI provides for our customers. We continue to invest aggressively while remaining focused on profitable growth. As we look ahead, two points that will affect sequential year-on-year revenue growth comparisons across Alphabet : first, Q1 results reflect the benefit of leap year, which contributed slightly more than 1 point to our revenue growth rate at the consolidated level in the first quarter; second, at current spot rates, we expect a larger headwind from foreign exchange in Q2 versus Q1. Turning to margins. Our efforts to durably reengineer our cost base are reflected in a 400 basis point expansion of our Alphabet operating margin year-on-year, excluding the impact of restructuring and severance charges in both periods. You can also see the impact in the quarter-on-quarter decline in head count in Q1, which reflects both actions we have taken over the past few months and a much slower pace of hiring. As we have discussed previously, we are continuing to invest in top engineering and technical talent, particularly in Cloud, Google DeepMind and technical infrastructure. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in order to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. We believe these efforts will enable us to deliver full year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the first quarter was $12 billion, once again driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. The significant year-on-year growth in CapEx in recent quarters reflects our confidence in the opportunities offered by AI across our business. Looking ahead, we expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 level, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx. With regard to Other Bets, we similarly have work streams underway to enhance overall returns. Finally, as I trust you saw in the press release, we are very pleased to be adding a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share to our capital return program as well as a new $70 billion authorization in share repurchases. The core of our capital allocation framework remains the same, beginning with investing aggressively in our business as you have heard us talk about today. Given the extraordinary opportunities ahead, we view the introduction of the dividend as further strengthening our overall capital return program. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp, and I will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have two. The first one, I wanted to ask about overall search behavior. Philipp, I know you talked in the past about how overall query trends continue to grow. Can I ask you to drill a little bit more into monetizable and commercial query trends? Has there been any changes in sort of your commercial query trends growth. There's just been all these new entrants moving around in e-commerce. That is my first one.  Then the second one for Ruth, when you talked about sort of more efforts to moderate expense growth from here, can you just sort of give us some examples of areas where you still see the potential for more optimization or work streams in place to continue to durably reengineer the OpEx base as we go throughout 2024. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Brian. To your first question, look, I think broadly, we've always found that over many years, when things work well on the organic side, monetization follows. So typically, the trends we see carry over well. Overall, I think with generative AI in Search, with our AI overviews, I think we will expand the type of queries we can serve our users. We can answer more complex questions as well as, in general, that all seems to carry over across query categories. Obviously, it's still early, and we are going to be measured and put user experience at the front, but we are positive about what this transition means. Ruth Porat : And on the second question in terms of the various work streams, as both Sundar and I said, we remain very focused on ongoing efforts to slow the pace of expense growth, what we've been calling durably reengineering our cost base. And I made this point in opening comments, but we are very cognizant of the increasing headwind we have from higher depreciation and expenses associated with the higher CapEx, and so these efforts are ongoing. And they're very much the same that we've talked with you about previously. It starts with product and process prioritization, all of the work around organizational efficiency and structure. These are ongoing. And so as an example, the work that Sundar talked about, combining devices and services with our platforms and ecosystems, product area is a really good example because unifying the teams not only helps us deliver higher-quality products and experiences, but we think it enables us to move with greater velocity and efficiency. And then the other work streams we've talked to you about in the past, like all of the work around technical infrastructure, which Sundar alluded to; streamlining operations within the company through the use of AI; what we're doing with procurement with our suppliers and vendors, which he also referenced; the work you've seen on real estate optimization, these are all ongoing work streams, which is why we have them under the umbrella, durably reengineering our cost base, and they are ongoing. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : Sundar, you talked about bringing more generative AI features into the main Search page. Can you just talk about what kind of queries or scenarios do you think that that's working best for so far? And just how we should think about the cadence of continuing to adopt more of those features within core search. And then Ruth, on CapEx spending, the $12 billion in 1Q, can we assume that run rating that and above is reasonable for this year? And I know it's very early, but should we generally expect higher CapEx next year as well? Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Doug. On SGE in Search, we are seeing early confirmation of our thesis that this will expand the universe of queries where we are able to really provide people with a mix of actual answers linked to sources across the Web and bring a variety of perspectives, all in an innovative way. And we've been rolling out AI overviews in the U.S. and the U.K., trying to mainly tackle queries which are more complex, where we think SGE will clearly improve the experience. We've already served billions of queries and it seems to cut across categories, but we are still continuing our testing. And we are metrics-driven in these areas. But I am optimistic that it clearly improves the user experience. Users are telling us that. And we are seeing it in our metrics, and we'll continue evolving it through the course of this year. Ruth Porat : And then in terms of CapEx, as I said in opening comments, we do expect the quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the $12 billion cash CapEx we had here in Q1. As I said, you can always have variability in the reported quarterly CapEx just due to the timing of cash payments, but roughly at or above this level. And it really goes to Sundar's opening comment that we're very committed to making the investments required to keep us at the leading edge in technical infrastructure to support the growth in Cloud, all the innovation in Search that he and Philipp has spoken about and our lead with Gemini.  I will note that nearly all of the CapEx was in our technical infrastructure. We expect that our investment in office facilities will be about less than 10% of the total CapEx in 2024, roughly flat with our CapEx in 2023, but is still there. And then with respect to 2025, as you said, it's premature to comment so nothing to add on that. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Maybe just one question of a big picture nature for Sundar. Sundar, if we come back to your earlier comments at the beginning of the call and framing up longer-term initiatives and longer-term narratives, I wanted to know if you could talk a little bit about both the opportunities and the challenges of operating at scale in a time like this where there's a lot of technology innovation going on and how you see the elements of trying to strike a balance towards moving the organization forward while still continuing to both invest for growth as well as balance margins. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Eric. Great question. Obviously, I think the AI transition, I think it's a once-in-a-generation kind of an opportunity. We've definitely been gearing up for this for a long time. You can imagine we started building TPUs in 2016, so we've definitely been gearing up for a long time. The real opportunities we see is the scale of research and innovation, which we have built up and are going to continue to deliver. I think for the first time, we can work on AI in a horizontal way and it impacts the entire breadth of the company, be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Cloud, be it Waymo and so on. And we see a rapid pace of innovation in that underlying. So it's a very leveraged way to do it, and I see that as a real opportunity ahead. In terms of the challenges, I think it's been a mindset shift, which we've been driving across the company to make sure that we are embracing this opportunity but being very efficient in how we are approaching it, making sure we are redirecting our people to the highest priorities across the company, building on our 20 years of experience in driving machine efficiencies year-on-year so that we can put our dollars to work as efficiently as possible. So making sure balancing all of that moving forward in a very bold and responsible way at the same time. Those are the important things to get right from my perspective. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with UBS. Stephen Ju : Philipp, I think it's approaching the 2-year anniversary for the launch of Ads on YouTube Shorts. And you've given us an update on monetization pickup sequentially. But with that in mind, I think YouTube has launched an array of ad products and automation tools to help advertisers transfer what they're doing to the vertical screen. So how is this translating into buy-in among your advertiser clients? And secondly, based on what you've seen over the last 2 years, are there any structural reasons that you can cite as to why the monetization cannot match what is already the case on the horizontal screen? Philipp Schindler : Yes. Look, this is a great question, first of all. I mean, let's start with the fact that YouTube performance was very strong in this quarter. And on Shorts specifically in the U.S., I mentioned how the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing has more than doubled in the last 12 months. I think that's what you were referring to. And yes, we're obviously very happy with this development.  The way to think about it is advertisers really only spend with us when they see a positive ROI. So you can assume that this wouldn't be happening unless it were to work for advertisers in the short term and also in the long term. That's an important part, I think. Overall, Shorts is a long-term bet for the business. It has really helped us respond to both creator and viewer demand for short-form video. We talked about the strong growth, averaging 70 billion daily views. I mentioned the number of channels uploading has increased 50% year-over-year, so again, very happy with us development. And to your question, structural reasons, whether we can't get to a match here, I have a hard time seeing those at the moment over time. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin Post : I'm going to ask another one on CapEx. It seems to be your biggest investment area. Just first, you saw the big uptick the last 2 quarters, but you've been investing in AI for years. Is the uptick because supply is getting easier to get? Or do you see more opportunities with the available supply to really fuel AI? So has the GPUs and everything gotten better that you feel more, investing more? And then thinking about the returns, both for Advertising and Cloud on the CapEx, do you feel like this is a higher cost of doing business? Or do you think this is an opportunity to even get better returns on your capital spend than you've had in the past? Ruth Porat : So the increase in CapEx, as Sundar said and I said, really reflects the opportunity we continue to see across the company. It starts with all that we're doing in support of the Gemini foundational model but then also, clearly, the work across Cloud, on behalf of Cloud customers, and the growth that we're seeing with GCP and the infrastructure work there, and then, of course, as both Sundar and Philipp talked about the application across Search, YouTube and, more broadly, the services that we're able to offer. So it's the growing application and our focus on ensuring that we have the compute capacity to deliver in support of the services and opportunities we see across Alphabet. And it really goes to the second part of your question, which is that as we're investing in CapEx and applying it across our various businesses, it opens up more services and products, which bring revenue opportunities. And we're very focused on the monetization opportunity. It does underlie everything that we're doing in Google Services and Google Cloud. And as Sundar noted, we're, at the same time, very focused on the efficiency of all elements of delivering that compute capacity from hardware, software and beyond. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Jian Li : This is Jian Li for Mark Mahaney. A couple of questions. One, just maybe an expansion on the Search, query questions on before, more like Search volume, and maybe in the context of the off-Google environment like AI chat bot, for example, we've seen kind of Meta AI directing to Google Search results. Do you think there's actually a scenario where like AI system can create a step function change in Search volume or use cases of Google? If you can give us more color on what are you seeing right now or what are you expecting to see in that area.  And then the second question on just the comment of YouTube and Cloud exiting at $100 billion run rate. What is informing this outlook or visibility for you? If you can talk about, is it driven by any sort of Cloud demand inflection or step change in the gen AI workload demand, if you can flesh it out a little bit? Sundar Pichai : On your first question, look, I said this before but to be clear, we view this moment as a positive moment for Search. And I think it allows us to evolve our product in a profound way. And Search is a unique experience. People come, be it if you want answers, if you want to explore more, if you want to get perspectives from across the web, and to be able to do it across the breadth and depth of everything they are looking for and the innovation you would need to keep that up, I think it's what we've been building on for a long time. And so I feel we are extraordinarily well set up, particularly given the innovation path we are on. And overall, I view this moment as a positive moment. So that's how I would say it. On the second part, Ruth? Ruth Porat : Sorry, what was it? Sundar Pichai : YouTube and Cloud. Jian Li : Yes, in terms of your comment about $100 billion exit rate for YouTube and Cloud, what's driving this visibility for you and any kind of inflection you're seeing in the Cloud demand? Ruth Porat : I would just say from Sundar's opening comments, it's just the ongoing momentum that we've seen in the business that we've been talking about, the ongoing growth and strong performance. And so what we were really getting at in that comment, what Sundar was getting at, is that we've continued to build strong businesses over time, and that just helps dimension it. We had similar comments last quarter when you talk about our subscription business. We're really proud of all the work that the teams are doing across the company, building new, strong opportunities, delivering for our users, for customers, for advertisers in profound ways. And so it was just helping to dimension what we have built over the years. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Kenneth Gawrelski : Two, if I may. First on GCP, you had nice acceleration in the quarter. Could you talk a little bit about the opportunities and constraints upon GCP's ability to continue to address that large addressable market and accelerate growth? Is it more sales-oriented? Is it more product sales solutions or both? And do you plan to address most of these organically? Or could a partner approach work for you? And then the second one, just more detail on YouTube and sports rights. Could you reiterate your view on further live sports rights? There's some larger, mostly in the U.S., league rights coming up soon and will be more over the next several years. Could you just talk about your philosophy there beyond NFL Sunday Ticket? Sundar Pichai : Look, on the Cloud side, obviously, it's definitely a point of inflection overall. I think the AI transformation is making everyone think about their whole stack, and we are engaged in a number of conversations. I think paid AI infrastructure, people are really looking to Vertex AI, given our depth and breadth of model choice, or using Workspace to transform productivity in your workplace, et cetera. So I think the opportunities there are all related to that, both all the work we've built up and AI being a point of inflection in terms of driving conversations. I think you'll see us do it both organically and with a strong partner program as well. So we'll do it with a combination. And the challenges here, always, there are switching costs to Cloud and the challenges we see is how do we make it easier for people. There's a lot of interest, but there's definitely barriers in terms of people switching. And so that's an area where we are constantly investing to make it easier for our customers. Philipp Schindler : And with regard to your sports rights question, look, I mean, we've had long-standing and significant partnerships with the most popular sports league here in the U.S., around the globe, federations teams, athletes, broadcasters. And obviously, these partnerships, in combination with our very vast audience of sports fans, drives investment in subscription experiences across many offerings : NFL Sunday Ticket, YouTube TV, YouTube Primetime Channels and so on. But there's nothing that we have to announce at the moment. We're obviously always looking at where we can create more value for our users, for our advertisers, for creators, but nothing specific to talk about at this moment. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Ross Sandler : Sundar, I had a question about smartphone-based AI searches. So you guys are powering all these new AI interactions and searches on Pixel and on Samsung devices. And I think there's speculation that Gemini might be used on iOS in a future state. So the question is, as users start searching on smartphones and those searches are basically rendered on the model, on the phone, without accessing the web, how do you guys anticipate monetizing some of these smartphone-based behaviors that are kind of run on the edge? Any thoughts on that? Sundar Pichai : Look, I think if you look at what users are looking for, people are looking for information and an ability to connect with things outside. So I think there will be a set of use cases which you will be able to do on device. But for a lot of what people are looking to do, I think you will need the richness of the cloud, the Web and you have to deliver it to users. So again, to my earlier comments, I think through all these moments, you saw what we have done with Samsung with Circle to Search. I think it gives a new way for people to access Search conveniently wherever they are. And so we view this as a positive way to bring our services to users in a more seamless manner. So I think it's positive from that perspective. In terms of on-device versus cloud, there will be needs which can be done on-device and we should to help it from a privacy standpoint. But there are many, many things for which people will need to reach out to the cloud. And so I don't see that as being a big driver in the on-cloud versus off-cloud in any way. Operator : And our last question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Colin Sebastian : I guess first, a follow-up on some of the questions on SGE in the core Search. I guess I'm wondering, along with some of those changes in behavior, is there a way to quantify that overall engagement shift, whether that's an increase in time spent or the level of increase in queries for both sort of traditional search as well as more generative answers.  And then secondly, on the hardware road map, I assume later this year, we'll hear more about some of the products. But any areas of particular focus or that you would point out that we should keep in mind in terms of hardware launches in the back half? Sundar Pichai : On the first question on Search, not much more to add to what I said, but what we have seen. And we've been in live experiments just for a few weeks in U.S. and U.K. on a slice of our queries, and all indications are positive that it improves user satisfaction. We see an increase in engagement, but I see this as something which will play out over time.  But if you were to step back at this moment, there were a lot of questions last year, and we always felt confident and comfortable that we would be able to improve the user experience. People question whether these things would be costly to serve, and we are very, very confident we can manage the cost of how to serve these queries. People worried about latency. When I look at the progress we have made in latency and efficiency, we feel comfortable. There are questions about monetization. And based on our testing so far, I'm comfortable and confident that we'll be able to manage the monetization transition here well as well. It will play out over time, but I feel we are well positioned. And more importantly, when I look at the innovation that's ahead and the way the teams are working hard on it, I am very excited about the future ahead. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks. James Friedland : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2024 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jim Friedland : Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Alphabet's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Ruth Porat. Now, I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Jim. And hello, everyone. I'm really pleased with our results this quarter. They showed tremendous ongoing momentum in Search and great progress in Cloud with our AI initiatives driving new growth. Search had another excellent quarter. And in terms of product innovation, we are seeing great progress with AI overviews. In Q2, Cloud reached some major milestones. Quarterly revenues crossed the $10 billion mark for the first time, at the same time pass the $1 billion mark in quarterly operating profit. Year-to-date, our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for Cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers. As I spoke about last quarter, we are uniquely well-positioned for the AI opportunity ahead. Our Research and Infrastructure leadership means, we can pursue an in-house strategy that enables our product teams to move quickly. Combined with our model building expertise, we are in a strong position to control our destiny, as the technology continues to evolve. Importantly, we are innovating at every layer of the AI stack, from chips to agents and beyond, a huge strength. We are committed to this leadership long-term. This was underscored by the announcements we made at I/O, Cloud Next, and Google Marketing Live, and we'll touch on many of them here. Today, I'll start with Search, then move to our AI momentum more generally, followed by Cloud, YouTube, and some closing thoughts. Let's dive in. Over the past 25 years, we have continued to reimagine and expand Google Search across many technological shifts. With AI, we are delivering better responses on more types of search queries and introducing new ways to search. We are pleased to see the positive trends from our testing continue as we roll out AI overviews, including increases in search usage, and increased user satisfaction with the results. People who are looking for help with complex topics are engaging more and keep coming back for AI overviews. And we see even higher engagement from younger users, aged 18 to 24, when they use search with AI overviews. As we have said, we are continuing to prioritize approaches that send traffic to sites across the web. And we are seeing that ads appearing either above or below AI overviews, continue to provide valuable options for people to take action and connect with businesses. Beyond AI overviews, AI expands the types of queries we are able to address and opens up powerful new ways to search. Visual search via Lens is one. Soon you'll be able to ask questions by taking a video with Lens. And already we have seen that AI overviews in Lens, leads to an increase in overall visual search usage. Another example is Circle to Search, which is available today on more than 100 million Android devices. We are seeing tremendous momentum from our AI investments. More than 1.5 million developers are now using Gemini across our developer tools. And we recently unveiled new models that are more capable and efficient than ever. Gemini now comes in 4 sizes, with each model designed for its own set of use cases. It's a versatile model family that runs efficiently on everything from data centers to devices. At 2 million tokens, we offer the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model to-date, which powers developer use cases that no other model can handle. Gemini is making Google's own products better. All six of our products with more than 2 billion monthly users now use Gemini. This means that Google is the company that's truly bringing AI to everyone. Gemini is powering incredibly helpful features in search, workspace, Google messages, and more. At I/O, we showed new features coming soon to Gmail and to Google Photos. Soon you'll be able to ask photos questions like, what did I eat at that restaurant in Paris last year? For a glimpse of the future, I hope you saw Project Astra at I/O. It shows multimodal understanding and natural conversational capabilities. We've always wanted to build a universal agent and it's an early look at how they can be helpful in daily life. Our AI product advances come from our long-standing foundation of research leadership, as well as our global network of infrastructure. In Q2, we announced our first data center and cloud region in Malaysia, and expansion projects in Iowa, Virginia, and Ohio. Our TPUs are a key bet here, too. Trillium is the sixth generation of our custom AI accelerator, and it's our best performing and most energy efficient TPU to-date. It achieves a near 5 times increase in peak compute performance per chip and a 67% more energy efficient compared to TPU v5e. And the latest Nvidia Blackwell platform, will be coming to Google Cloud in early 2025. We continue to invest in designing and building robust and efficient infrastructure to support our efforts in AI, given the many opportunities we see ahead. Of course, as we do this, we'll continue to create capacity by allocating resources towards our highest priorities. We are relentlessly driving efficiencies in our AI models. For example, over the past quarter, we have made quality improvements that include doubling the core model size for AI overviews, while at the same time improving latency and keeping cost per AI overviews served flat. And we are focused on matching the right model size to the complexity of the query in order to minimize impact on cost and latency. Separately on our real estate investments, we are taking a measured approach to match the current and future needs of our hybrid workforce, as well as our local communities. Next, Google Cloud. We continue to see strong customer interest, winning leading brands like Hitachi, Motorola Mobility, and KPMG. Our deep partnership with Oracle significantly expanded our joint offerings to the large customer base. Our momentum begins with our AI infrastructure, which provides AI startups like Essential AI, with leading cost performance for models and high-performance computing applications. We continue to drive fundamental differentiation with new advances since Cloud Next. This includes Trillium, which I mentioned earlier, and A3 Mega powered by Nvidia H100 GPUs, which doubles the networking bandwidth of A3. Our enterprise AI platform, Vertex, helps customers such as Deutsche Bank, Kingfisher, and the US Air Force build powerful AI agents. Last month, we announced a number of new advances. Uber and WPP are using Gemini Pro 1.5 and Gemini Flash 1.5 in areas like customer experience and marketing. We broaden support for third-party models, including Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and open source models like Gemma 2, Llama and Mistral. We are the only cloud provider to offer grounding with Google Search, and we are expanding grounding capabilities with Moody's, MSCI, ZoomInfo, and more. Our AI-powered applications portfolio is helping us win new customers and drive upsell. For example, our conversational AI platform is helping customers like Best Buy and Gordon Food Service. Gemini for Workspace helps click therapeutics analyze patient feedback as they build targeted digital treatments. Our AI-powered agents are also helping customers develop better quality software, find insights from their data, and protect their organization against cybersecurity threats using Gemini. Software engineers at Wipro are using Gemini code assist to develop, test, and document software faster. And data analysts at Mercado Libre are using BigQuery and Looker to optimize capacity planning and fulfill shipments faster. Cyber security risks continue to accelerate and the number of breaches continue to grow, something we all see in the news every day and that our [Mandiant teams] (ph) help manage. Our strong track record of uptime, quality control and reliability made Google Cloud the trusted security choice for organizations like Fiserv and Marriott International. In Q2, we infused AI throughout our security portfolio, helping TELUS strengthen its proactive security posture. Turning next to YouTube, YouTube is focused on a clear strategy, connecting creators with a massive audience and enabling them to build successful businesses through ads and subscriptions, while helping advertisers reach their desired audience. We had a great brand cast this quarter, and Philip will say more. I'm pleased at the progress here. YouTube has remained number one in US Streaming watch time, according to Nielsen. Views of YouTube shots on connected TVs more than double last year. And we are making it easier for creators to add captions and turn regular videos into shots. Next, on Android and Pixel. We joined Samsung for their Galaxy Unpacked event a few weeks ago, and we shared that Samsung's new devices will include the latest AI-powered Google updates on Android. It was a great event. I'm looking forward to our Made by Google event happening in August. We'll have lots to share around Android and the Pixel portfolio of devices. Our Pixel line is doing well. We recently introduced the new Pixel 8a, powered by our latest Google Tensor G3 chip. It provides beautiful AI experiences like Circle to Search, Best Take, and a Gemini-powered AI assistant. In other bets, I'm really pleased with the progress Waymo's making, a real leader in the space and getting rave reviews from users. Waymo's served more than 2 million trips to-date and driven more than 20 million fully autonomous miles on public roads. Waymo's now delivering well over 50, 000 weekly paid public rides, primarily in San Francisco and Phoenix. And in June, we removed the waitlist in San Francisco, so anyone can take a ride. Fully autonomous testing is underway in other Bay Area locations without a human in the driver's seat. Before I close, I want to acknowledge that today is Ruth's final earnings call. Let me take a moment to thank her for all she has done for Google and Alphabet as our longest-serving CFO. I'm excited to continue to work with her in her new role. And I look forward to welcoming our newly appointed CFO, Anat Ashkenazi. She starts next week, and you'll hear from her on our call next quarter. Thanks as always to our employees and partners everywhere for a great Q2. With that, over to you, Philip. Philipp Schindler : Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. Starting with performance, Google Services delivered revenues of $73.9 billion for the quarter, up 12% year-on-year. Search and other revenues grew 14% year-on-year, led by growth in the retail vertical, followed by financial services. YouTube ads revenues were up 13% year-on-year driven by growth and brand as well as direct response. Network revenues declined 5% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms, and devices, year-on-year revenues increased 14%, driven again by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions. For the rest of my remarks, I want to double click on two topics. First, how we're applying AI across the marketing process to deliver an even stronger ads experience. Second, YouTube's position as the leading multi-format platform. So let me start by sharing some of the ways we are applying AI to bring more performance benefits to even more businesses. Q2 brought several major opportunities to meet and learn from users, developers, creators, and customers. From I/O to Brandcast, Google Marketing Live and Can, a growing number of our customers and partners are looking to understand how to successfully incorporate AI into their businesses. This quarter, we announced over 30 new ads features, and products to help advertisers leverage AI and keep pace with the evolving expectations of customers and users. Across Search, PMax, DemandGen, and Retail, we're applying AI to streamline workflows, enhance creative asset production, and provide more engaging experiences for consumers. Listening to our customers, retailers in particular have welcomed AI-powered features to help scale the depth and breadth of their assets. For example, as part of a new and easier-to-use merchant center, we've expanded Product Studio, with tools that bring the power of Google AI to every business owner. You can upload a product image from the AI with something like, feature this product with Paris skyline in the background and Product Studio will generate campaign ready assets. I also hear great feedback from our customers on many of our other new AI-powered features. We're beta testing, virtual try on and shopping ads and plan to roll it out widely later this year. Feedback shows this feature gets 60% more high-quality views than other images and a higher click-out to retailer sites. Retailers love it because it drives purchasing decisions and fewer returns. Our AI-driven profit optimization tools have been expanded to performance max and standard shopping campaigns. Advertisers use profit optimization and smart bidding see a 15% uplift in profit on average compared to revenue-only bidding. Lastly, DemandGen is rolling out to Display in Video 360 and Search Ads 360 in the coming months with new generative image tools that create stunning high-quality image assets for social marketers. As we said at GML, when paired with Search or PMax, DemandGen delivers an average of 14% more conversions. The use cases we're seeing across the industry show the incredible potential of these AI-enabled products to improve performance. Let me briefly share two examples with you. Luxury jewelry retailer Tiffany leveraged DemandGen during the holiday season and saw 2.5% brand lift in consideration and actions, such as adding items to cards and booking appointments. The campaign drove a 5.6 times more efficient cost per click compared to social media benchmarks. Our own Google marketing team used DemandGen to create nearly 4,500 ad variations for a Pixel 8 campaign shown across YouTube, Discover, and Gmail, delivering twice the click-through rate at nearly a quarter of the cost. In addition to strengthening our ads products for customers, we continue to evolve our existing systems and products with improved models delivering further performance gains. In just six months, AI-driven improvements to quality, relevance, and language understanding have improved Broad Match performance by 10% for advertisers using Smart Bidding. Also, advertisers who adopt PMax to Broad Match and Smart Bidding in their Search campaigns, see an average increase of over 25% more conversions or value at a similar cost. We'll continue to listen to our customers and use their feedback to drive innovation across our products. As you can hear, I continue to be excited about the AI era for ads. Now let's turn to YouTube. I've talked before about our approach to making YouTube the best place to create, watch and monetize. First, the best place to create. What sets YouTube apart from every other platform are the creators and the connection they have with their fans. Audiences tuning in to watch their favorite creators continue to grow. For example, two weeks ago, Mr. Beast's channel hit more than 300 million subscribers. Next, the best place to watch. Our long-term investment in CTV continues to deliver. Views on CTV have increased more than 130% in the last three years. According to Nielsen, YouTube is the Number #1 most watched streaming platform on TV screens in the US for the 17th consecutive month. Zooming out, when you look not just at streaming, but at all media companies and their combined TV viewership, YouTube is the second most watched after Disney. And this growth is happening in multiple verticals, including sports, which has seen CTV watch time on YouTube grow 30% year-over-year. Lastly, the best place to monetize. CTV on YouTube is continuing to benefit from a combination of strong watch time growth, viewer and advertiser innovation and a shift in brand advertising budgets from linear TV to YouTube. Our largest advertisers across verticals, including retail, entertainment, telco and home and personal care, are partnering with creators on ads and organic integrations. Verizon, for example, worked with a YouTube creator and Verizon customer to show them many ways that plans and offerings can be customized to fit people\u2019s lives. Using AI-powered formats, they created sketches in multiple lengths and orientations to serve the right creative to the right viewer and drive people to their site. Verizon's creator ads had a 15% lower CPA and a 38% higher conversion rate versus other ads. Turning to Shorts. Last quarter, I shared that in the US, the monetization rate of YouTube Shorts relative to in-stream viewing is showing a healthy rate of growth. Again, this quarter, we continue to see an improvement in Shorts monetization, particularly in the US. We are also seeing a very encouraging contribution from brand advertising on Shorts, which we launched on the product in Q4 last year. Lastly, a few words on shopping. Last year, viewers watched 30 billion hours of shopping-related videos, and we saw a 25% increase in watch time for videos that help people shop. While it is early days, shopping remains a key area of investment. At GML, we rolled out several product updates to YouTube shopping, helping creators sell products to their viewers. These updates included; product tagging where creators can tag products in their videos for viewers to discover and purchase, product collections and a new affiliate hub, a one-stop shop for creators to find deals and promotional offers from brands and track their affiliate earnings. With that, I'll finish by saying a huge thank you to Google's everywhere for their extraordinary commitment and to our customers and partners for their continued collaboration and trust. And Ruth, thanks for your amazing leadership and partnership over all these years. Now for one last time, it's over to you. Ruth Porat : Thank you, Philipp, and thanks, Sundar, for those kind words. We had another strong quarter, driven in particular by performance in Search and Cloud, as well as the ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $84.7 billion, up 14% or up 15% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $35.5 billion, up 11%. Other cost of revenues was $22.1 billion, up 14%, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs, followed by depreciation as well as the impact of the Canadian digital services tax, which was applied retroactively. Operating expenses were $21.8 billion up 5%, primarily reflecting an increase in R&D partially offset by a decline in G&A with sales and marketing essentially flat to the second quarter last year. The increase in R&D was driven primarily by compensation which was affected by lapping a reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities in certain other bets in the second quarter last year followed by depreciation. The largest single factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal matters. Operating income was $27.4 billion, up 26% and our operating margin was 32%. Net income was $23.6 billion and EPS was $1.89. We delivered free cash flow of $13.5 billion in the second quarter and $60.8 billion for the trailing 12 months. As a reminder, last year, we had a timing benefit in the second and third quarters from a $10.5 billion deferred cash tax payment made in the fourth quarter, which depressed reported free cash flow growth this quarter, and we'll do so again next quarter. We ended the quarter with $101 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $73.9 billion, up 12%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $48.5 billion in the quarter were up 14%, led again by growth in retail, followed by the financial services vertical. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.7 billion were up 13% driven by brand followed by direct response advertising. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 5%. Subscription platforms and devices revenues were $9.3 billion up 14%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues. TAC was $13.4 billion, up 7%. Google Services operating income was $29.7 billion up 27% and the operating margin was 40%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $10.3 billion for the quarter, up 29%, reflecting first significant growth in GCP, which was above growth for cloud overall and includes an increasing contribution from AI. And second, strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $1.2 billion and an operating margin of 11%. As to our Other Bets for the second quarter, revenues were $365 million and the operating loss was $1.1 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, First, within advertising. The strong performance of search was broad-based across verticals. In YouTube, we are pleased with the growth in the quarter. We had healthy watch time growth continued to close the monetization gap in Shorts and had continued momentum in Connected TV, with brand benefiting in part from an ongoing shift in budgets from linear television to digital. As we look forward to the third quarter, we will be lapping the increasing strength in advertising revenues in the second half of 2023, in part from APAC based retailers. Turning to subscriptions, platforms and devices. First, we continue to have significant growth in our subscriptions business which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line. However, there was a sequential decline in the year-on-year growth rate, as we anniversaried the impact of a price increase for YouTubeTV in the second quarter last year. The impact will persist through the balance of the year. Second, with regard to platforms. We are pleased with the performance in play driven by an increase in buyers. Finally, with respect to devices. The most important point as we look forward is that our Made by Google launches have been pulled forward into the third quarter from the fourth quarter last year benefiting revenues in Q3 this year. Turning to cloud, which continued to deliver very strong results. For the first time, Cloud crossed $10 billion in quarterly revenues and $1 billion in quarterly operating profit. As Sundar noted year-to-date, our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers. We're particularly encouraged that the majority of our top 100 customers are already using our generative AI solutions. We continue to invest aggressively in the business. Turning to margins. The margin expansion in Q2 versus last year reflects our ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base, as well as revenue strength. Our leadership team remains focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in order to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. Once again headcount declined quarter-on-quarter, which reflects both actions we have taken in the first half of the year and a much slower pace of hiring. Looking ahead, we expect a slight increase in headcount in the third quarter, as we bring on new graduates. As we have discussed previously, we\u2019re continuing to invest in top engineering and technical talent, particularly in cloud and technical infrastructure. Looking forward, we continue to expect to deliver full-year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023. However, in the third quarter operating margins will reflect the impact of both the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure, as well as the increase in cost of revenues due to the pull-forward of hardware launches into Q3. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the second quarter was $13 billion, once again driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. Looking ahead, we continue to expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 CapEx of $12 billion keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx. With regard to other bets, we continue to focus on improving overall efficiencies, as we invest for long-term returns. Waymo is an important example of this, with its technical leadership coupled with progress on operational performance. As you will see in the 10-Q, we have chosen to commit to a new multi-year investment of $5 billion. This new round of funding, which is consistent with recent annual investment levels will enable Waymo to continue to build the world's leading autonomous driving technology company. To close, this is my 56th and last earnings call, 37 of them at Alphabet. So I have a few closing thoughts of gratitude. I've been so proud to be at Google and Alphabet as CFO and to work with some of the smartest people in the world every day. I think, we have accomplished a lot in the last nine plus years, and I am confident that progress will continue. Of course, I'm not going far and I'm honored to have my new role, which I've been slowly working my way into during the past 11 months and I look forward to continuing to work with Sundar, and our great team. Being CFO of one of the most important companies in the world has been the opportunity and responsibility of a lifetime. Google's Mission of advancing technology and bringing information to people throughout the world is as relevant today as it was when I worked on its IPO. Technology has been a catalyst for economic growth throughout human history. The people on this call know that if a technological advancement is not the focus of every business and government, they will be left behind. Underpinning this is the need for sound and responsible investment. That has never been more important than today and certainly, that is Google and Alphabet's focus. I want to end by thanking Googlers around the world for the innovation and commitment that has enabled us to deliver such extraordinary products and services globally. I also want to thank our investors and analysts for your long-term support and your feedback. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. First, thank you Ruth for all the help and significant impact over the past decade. The first one, it is a little bit of a jump ball, I guess for Sundar, Philipp or Ruth. I guess we're sort of 18 months this fever pitch around the GenAI focus in the world. Maybe from any of your perspective, can you just sort of talk to us about areas where you've seen faster than expected traction or testing adoption of some of the AI, generative AI capabilities versus slower than expected traction and testing from a Google perspective. And then, Ruth I appreciate all the comments about structurally reengineering the OpEx base. Are there any more tangible examples of areas you can talk to us about where you still see further ways to drive more efficiency across the company. Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Brian, thanks. I'll take the first part. I think it's a good question. Obviously, I think there is a time curve in terms of taking the underlying technology and translating it into meaningful solutions across the Board, both on the consumer and the enterprise side. Definitely, on the consumer side, I'm pleased, as I said in my comments earlier in terms of how for a product like Search, which is used at that scale over many decades. How we've been able to introduce it in a way that it's additive and enhances the overall experience and this positively contributing there. I think across our consumer products, we've been able -- I think we are seeing progress on the organic side. Obviously monetization is something that we would have to earn on top of it. The enterprise side, I think we are at a stage where definitely there are a lot of models. I think roughly, the models are all kind of converging towards a set of base capabilities. But I think where the next wave is, working to build solutions on top of it. And I think there are pockets, be it coding, be it in customer service, et cetera, where we are seeing some of those use cases seeing traction, but I still think there is hard work there to completely unlock those. Ruth Porat : And on your second question first, thank you for your comments. Look, the reason we've consistently used the term, the phrase that we're focused on durably reengineering our cost base is because these are deep work streams. They are not tactical fixes, and we continue to build on them. And so the main areas that we've talked about are around product and process prioritization around organizational efficiency and structure. Both of those are reflected in the headcount and the fact that headcount is down year-on-year. And across all of those -- as I said, across our entire leadership team, we remain focused on continuing to execute against them. So in terms of the most recent examples, as we talked about last quarter with the combination of the devices and services product area with the platforms and ecosystems product area, we announced that back in April. And what we discussed last quarter and what we're seeing is that unifying teams across these organizations, helps with product execution and what we're really focused on is really adding to velocity and efficiency. So kind of the gift that keeps giving. And then more broadly, all of the work streams that we've talked to you about before, we continue to remain focused on. A big one, very important one, is all of the efficiency efforts, the work streams around technical infrastructure and improving efficiency there. We are also working on the use of AI across Alphabet. We are working on continuing to build on what we've done with our centralized procurement organization. We are continuing to optimize our real estate portfolio. And so again this is across our leadership team. These are efforts that all build to this phrase durably reengineering our cost base. Brian Nowak : Great. Thank you both. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking my questions. One for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth you've now had Google Services operating margins roughly 40% for the past two quarters. Just as you create more capacity to help offset the future investments, is it reasonable to think that you could sustain at those kind of levels going forward? And then, Sundar just as it relates to AI overviews, you talked about the positive trends there. Can you just help us understand where you are, how far along in rolling-out AI overviews and then any more color around kind of click-through rates and monetization levels relative to your traditional searches. Thanks. Ruth Porat : So in terms of the Google services operating margin, it did reflect all the work that we are doing on durably reengineering the cost base. It also reflected the benefit of strong revenue performance in search. And so what I tried to lay out in the comments, as we look forward to the third quarter is operating margins will reflect the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with higher levels of our investment in technical infrastructure. It will also reflect higher expenses associated with the Pixel launch, due to the pull forward. So those are important factors. I would say, overall company-wide, it is important to note that we do expect to continue to deliver full year '24 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023, but I did want to highlight those important points as we look forward to Q3. Sundar Pichai : And Doug, thanks. On the AI overview, we are -- we have rolled it out in the US and we are -- will be through the course of the year, definitely scaling it up both to more countries. And also, we have taken a conservative start focused on quality, making sure the metrics are healthy and so on, but you will see us expand the use cases around it, and we'll touch definitely more queries. All the feedbacks we have seen are positive. And on the monetization side, I think Philipp has touched upon it. Maybe Philipp, anything more you want to add there? Philipp Schindler : Yes, look, innovation and improvements to the user experience on search have historically opened up new opportunities for advertisers. We talked about this before we saw this when we navigated from desktop to mobile for example. And we can see GenAI obviously expand the types of questions we can help people with, as Sundar mentioned. And as we said before, people are finding ads either above or below AI overviews helpful. We have a solid baseline here from which we can innovate and as you have probably noticed at GML, we announced that soon we'll actually start testing Search and Shopping ads in AI overviews for users in the US, and they will have the opportunity to actually appear within the overview in a section clearly labeled as sponsored, when they're relevant to both the query and the information in the AI overview, really giving us the ability to innovate here and take this to the next level. Doug Anmuth : Thank you. Best of luck, Ruth, in your new role. Ruth Porat : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with Moffett. Please go ahead. Michael Nathanson : Thanks. I have two, one for Sundar and one for Philipp. Sundar, on decision this week to not deprecate cookies. I know it's been a long journey. Can you talk a bit about what we should expect in terms of new experience in Chrome and why the company makes a decision not to go down the path on deprecating cookies. And then Philipp, I know it's only one quarter, but it's interesting that Search is growing faster than YouTube, which surprised some of us. But can you talk about what factors you think are kind of differences in growth rates between these markets? And is there anything on the AI front that you could see maybe reaccelerating YouTube growth, as you've seen happen with Search. Thanks so much. Sundar Pichai : And Michael on cookies, Look I think, obviously we are super committed to improving privacy for users in chrome and there was the whole focus around privacy sandbox and we remain committed on the journey, but on third-party cookies, given the implications across the ecosystems and considerations and feedback across so many stakeholders. We now believe user choice is the best path forward there and we'll both improve privacy by giving users choice and we'll continue our investments in privacy enhancing technologies, but it is obviously an area we will be taking feedback from the players in the ecosystem and we are committed to being privacy first as well. Philipp Schindler : And on the second part of your question, maybe Ruth, you want to jump in first and then I take the rest if needed. Ruth Porat : Absolutely. So Look, as we both noted, search revenues really reflected broad based growth across verticals. That was led by retail followed by financial services. I think your question really goes to the heart of the year-on-year growth comparison. And as both Philipp and I noted, we are really pleased with YouTube, the YouTube team all that was done, it was driven by brand followed by direct response, and they have very strong ongoing operating metrics, which Philipp will comment on. I think the important point to note, and I tried to tease out in opening comments, was that the deceleration in this year-on-year revenue growth for the second quarter versus the first quarter, primarily reflected the tougher comparison versus the first quarter because at that point, as you probably recall, YouTube was lapping negative year-on-year growth in Q1 last year. And then also Q1 benefited from the extra from leap year. And so what you are also seeing here is with YouTube, we were [anniversaring] (ph) the ramp in APAC based retailers that began in the second quarter last year and foreign exchange headwinds as well that we noted. And so it's -- there are some timing issues going on. And what we are trying to highlight is the underlying operating strength. Back to you, Philipp. Philipp Schindler : Yes, that was very comprehensive. Nothing really to add from my side here. Sundar Pichai : The only thing I would say, adding to Brian's first question on areas where things are maybe taking longer. I think, look we are all building multimodal models. At least Gemini has been natively multimodal from the ground up. But most of the use cases today that have been unlocked have been around the tech side. So in terms of getting real generative audio, video experience is working well. I think there is still \u2013 it is going to take some time. But over time, obviously it will be deeply relevant to YouTube and so it's an area I'm excited about in the future. Michael Nathanson : Okay. Thanks a lot. And best to you. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much. And I'll echo the thanks for Ruth, for all the insights and partnership over the years on these earnings calls. Sundar maybe first for you, in terms of Cloud and bringing AI to the enterprise, I wanted to know if you go a little bit deeper in terms of how you are seeing AI actually get adopted implemented, what it potentially could mean for the strategic positioning of the cloud business and the potential for AI workloads to be a stimulant to revenue growth for Cloud first. And then following up the last set of questions on YouTube are really about the macro or the ad environment. What do you guys, as a team, continue to learn about the subscription side of YouTube and the appetite for consumers to engage with a broader array of media products at the subscription layer. Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Thanks Eric. Look, on the Cloud and AI stuff, obviously, it is something which I think will end up being a big driver over time. I mentioned in my opening remarks, already if you take a look at our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud across everything we do, be it compute on the AI side, the products we have through Vertex AI, Gemini for Workspace and Gemini for Google Cloud, et cetera, we definitely are seeing traction. People are deeply engaging with Gemini models across Vertex and AI studio. We now have over 2 million developers playing around with these things, and you are definitely seeing early use cases. But I think we are in this phase, where we have to deeply work and make sure on these use cases, on these workflows. We are driving deeper progress on unlocking value, which I'm very bullish will happen, but these things take time. So -- but if I were to take a longer-term outlook, I definitely see a big opportunity here. And I think particularly for us, given the extent to which we are investing in AI, our research infrastructure leadership, all of that translates directly. And so I'm pretty excited about the opportunity space ahead. Ruth Porat : And then on your second question with respect to subscriptions, I am implicit in your question, how strong is it, as I noted in opening comments, that overall line subscriptions platforms and devices delivered healthy growth and that was led by subscriptions. And as we've said on many calls here in a row, the subscription revenue growth continued to be quite strong. It was driven by subscriber growth in both YouTube TV and YouTube Music premium. And then the other component within that line is Google One that also delivered strong subscriber and revenue growth. I think the heart of your question is really around YouTube and that is the heart of the revenues in that line. So it continues to be very strong. We see a lot of take up in it, strong subscriber growth, really pleased with it. We did note that growth on that line decelerated due to anniversarying the YouTube TV price increase. But at the heart of it, our people interested in the subscription offerings and it\u2019s the take of significant. We're really pleased with it. Eric Sheridan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open. Ross Sandler : Hi, everybody. Just two questions on the AI CapEx. So it looks like from the outside at least, the hyperscaler industry is going from kind of an under bill situation this time last year to better meeting the demand with capacity right now to potentially being overbuilt next year if these CapEx growth rates keep up. So do you think that's a fair characterization? And how are we thinking about the return on invested capital with this AI CapEx cycle. And then related to that, do you think that the AI industry is close to or far away from hitting some kind of wall on foundation model improvement in AI training, based on like lack of availability of new data to train on. Just your thoughts on that would be great. Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks Ross. I think great questions. Look, I -- obviously, we are at an early stage of what I view as a very transformative area and in technology when you are going through these transitions, aggressively investing upfront in a defining category, particularly in an area in which in a leveraged way cuts across all our core areas our products, including Search, YouTube and other services, as well as fuels growth in Cloud and supports the innovative long-term Bets and Other Bets is definitely something for us makes sense to lean in. I think the one way I think about it is when we go through a curve like this, the risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here, even in scenarios where if it turns out that we are over investing. We clearly -- these are infrastructure, which are widely useful for us. They have long useful lives and we can apply it across, and we can work through that. But I think not investing to be at the frontier, I think definitely has much more significant downside. Having said that, we obsess around every dollar we put in. Our teams are -- work super hard, I'm proud of the efficiency work, be it optimization of hardware, software, model deployment across our fleet. All of that is something we spend a lot of time on, and that's how we think about it. To your second question on whether -- how do the scaling loss hold. Are we hitting on some kind of wall or something? Look, I think we are all pushing very hard, and there is going to be a few efforts, which will scale up on the compute side and push the boundaries of these models. What I would tell is regardless of how that plays out, you still think there is enough optimizations we are all doing, which is driving constant progress in terms of the capabilities of the models. And more importantly, taking them and translating into real use cases across the consumer and enterprise side, I think on that frontier. I think there is still a lot of progress to be had. And so we are pretty focused on that as well. Ross Sandler : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with UBS. Your line is now open. Stephen Ju : Okay. Thank you so much. So Sundar, I guess to ask the AI question a different way. As we talk to some of the model builders out there, it looks like the initial use cases are more on the cost savings or efficiency side. But when do we -- when do you think we'll start thinking about products that can help revenue generation for the Fortune 500, Fortune 1000 companies, which is probably something that can hopefully create greater value over time versus just cutting costs? And Philipp, listening to what will be, I guess Ruth's final comments on Q2 on these public calls. And thank you, by the way Ruth, for all the help. I couldn't help but notice that the bigger factors were brand followed by direct response. And if we continue to think that the one you bring up first is the larger factor and tying this into your prior commentary about shopping being an important consideration. When do you think we'll start talking about direct response being a much bigger contributor to YouTube's growth versus brand? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On the first part of the question look I think the technology's horizontal enough, it can apply on both sides. If you take a use case like improving the customer service experience, it is part of it which is driving efficiencies, and you can look at it from a cost standpoint, but you could also be overall improving the experience, improving conversion, driving the funnel better. And so increasing basket size if you are a retail e-commerce player, et cetera. So we are seeing people experiment across both sides. And so I think, you will see it played across both sides. Philipp, on the second one? Philipp Schindler : Yes. On the second one, look on the direct response side, as you know it is about driving and converting commercial intent and customers are obviously benefiting from including video in their AI-powered campaigns, it could be PMax, it could be DemandGen and obviously using our automated tools to enhance and create video creatives. And we are very, very optimistic about this path. On average advertisers who run both image and video ads with DemandGen campaigns see 6% more conversions per dollar than those running image only ads and discovery. And this is just one little example of how this can obviously boost your performance business. So that's a big part. The brand side, as you know Google AI continues to make it easier for brands to show up next to the content where viewers are obviously the most engaged. And they're finding it, as you can see from the numbers, a very effective way to drive awareness and consideration. And we are also quite excited about some of the recent launches on YouTube shopping side, if you want to put that into the direct response bucket. Stephen Ju : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our last question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Great. I'll ask a couple of areas. First on the cloud acceleration, would you characterize that as new AI demand helping drive that year-to-date? Or is that more of a rebound in just general compute and other demand or is AI really moving this forward and helping drive acceleration. And then I wanted to ask about your internal cost savings which has been really strong. How are you using AI internally to help cut costs? Are you seeing better efficiencies with your engineers? And just would love to hear about how you are applying AI to cut your own costs? Thank you. Ruth Porat : Great. Thank you for that. So overall we are -- as both Sundar and I said, we are very pleased with the results in Cloud. And there is clearly a benefit as the Cloud team is engaging broadly with customers around the globe with AI related solutions, AI infrastructure solutions and the generative-AI solutions. I think we noted that we're particularly encouraged that the majority of our top 100 customers are already using our generative AI solution. So it is clearly adding to strength of the business on top of all that they are doing. And just to be really clear, the results for GCP, the growth rate for GCP is above the growth for cloud overall. And then I'll turn it to Sundar on the cost saving point, but just one point we are really pleased as well that Cloud's margin improved as it did. And in part, that reflects the revenue strength that they delivered and all of the efficiency efforts that I've already spoken about. But looking ahead in Q3, we do expect the same seasonal pattern that you saw last year with respect to margin and we are continuing to invest in the business. Sundar Pichai : Look, I think specifically, if the question is about engineers and coding, et cetera, we definitely want to be on the cutting edge there. I think, we are making these tools available to some of the most [line of] (ph) productive engineers and demanding engineers out there, and they are definitely kicking the tires hard. And -- but I would say, it's still all in very early stages. I think particularly when it comes to writing high-quality secure code, but I think all the learnings what we are gaining here will translate into our models and products, and that's the virtuous cycle, which I'm excited by. So there's a lot more to come. Justin Post : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks. Jim Friedland : Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2024 call. Thank you and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jim Friedland : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Anat Ashkenazi. Now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thank you, Jim, and hello, everyone. Q3 was another great quarter. The momentum across the company is extraordinary, as you've seen in recent product launches, and as you will hear on the call today. Our commitment to innovation as well as a long-term focus and investment in AI are paying off and driving success for the company and for our customers. We are uniquely positioned to lead in the era of AI because of our differentiated full stack approach to AI innovation, and we are now seeing this operate at scale. It has three components. First, a robust AI infrastructure that includes data centers, chips and a global fiber network. Second, world-class research teams who are advancing our work with deep technical AI research and who are also building the models that power our efforts. And third, a broad global reach through products and platforms that touch billions of people and customers around the world, creating a virtuous cycle. Let me quickly touch on each of these. We continue to invest in state-of-the-art infrastructure to support our AI efforts from the U.S. to Thailand to Uruguay. We are also making bold clean energy investments, including the world's first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors, which will enable up to 500 megawatts of new 24/7 carbon-free power. We are also doing important work inside our data centers to drive efficiencies while making significant hardware and model improvements. For example, we shared that since we first began testing AI Overviews, we have lowered machine cost per query significantly. In 18 months, we reduced cost by more than 90% for these queries through hardware, engineering and technical breakthroughs while doubling the size of our custom Gemini model. And of course, we use and offer our customers a range of AI accelerator options, including multiple classes of NVIDIA GPUs and our own custom-built TPUs. We are now on the sixth generation of TPUs known as Trillium and continue to drive efficiencies and better performance with them. Turning to research. Our team at Google DeepMind continues to drive our leadership. Let me take a moment to congratulate Demis Hassabis and John Jumper on winning the Noble Prize in chemistry for their work on AlphaFold. This is an extraordinary achievement and underscores the incredible talent we have and how critical our world-leading research is to the modern AI revolution and to our future progress. Also, congratulations to Jeff Vinton, who spent over a decade here on winning the Noble Prize in physics. Our research teams also drive our industry-leading Gemini model capabilities, including long context understanding, multimodality and agentive capabilities. By any measure, token volume, API calls, consumer usage, business adoption, usage of the Gemini models is in a period of dramatic growth. And our teams are actively working on performance improvements and new capabilities for our range of models. Stay tuned. And they are building out experiences where AI can see and reason about the world around you. Project Astra is a glimpse of that future. We are working to ship experiences like this as early as 2025. We then work to bring those advances to consumers and businesses. Today, all seven of our products and platforms with more than 2 billion monthly users use Gemini models. That includes the latest product to surpass the 2 billion user milestone Google Maps. Beyond Google's own platforms, following strong demand, we are making Gemini even more broadly available to developers. Today, we shared that Gemini is now available on GitHub Copilot with more to come. To support our investments across these three pillars, we are organizing the company to operate with speed and agility. We recently moved the Gemini app team to Google DeepMind to speed up deployment of new models and streamline post-training work. This follows other structural changes that have unified teams in research, machine learning infrastructure and our developer teams, as well as our security efforts and our platforms and devices team. This is all helping us move faster. For instance, it was a small dedicated team that built Notebook LM, an incredibly popular product that has so much promise. We're also using AI internally to improve our coding processes, which is boosting productivity and efficiency. Today, more than a quarter of all new code at Google is generated by AI, then reviewed and accepted by engineers. This helps our engineers do more and move faster. I'm energized by our progress and the opportunities ahead, and we continue to be laser-focused on building great products. Let me turn now to the quarterly highlights. In search, recent advancements, including AI Overviews, Circle to Search and new features in Lens are transforming the user experience, expanding what people can search for and how they search for it. This leads to users coming to search more often for more of their information needs, driving additional search queries. Just this week, AI Overview started rolling out to more than 100 new countries and territories. It will now reach more than 1 billion users on a monthly basis. We are seeing strong engagement, which is increasing overall search usage and user satisfaction. People are asking longer and more complex questions and exploring a wider range of websites. What's particularly exciting is that this growth actually increases over time as people learn that Google can answer more of their questions. The integration of ads within AI Overviews is also performing well, helping people connect with businesses as they search. Circle to Search is now available on over 150 million Android devices with people using it to shop, translate text and learn more about the world around them. A third of the people who have tried Circle to Search now use it weekly, a testament to its helpfulness and potential. Meanwhile, Lens is now used for over 20 billion visual searches per month. Lens is one of the fastest-growing query types we see on search because of its ability to answer complex multimodal questions and help in product discovery and shopping. For all these AI features, it's just the beginning, and you will see a rapid pace of innovation and progress here. Next, Google Cloud. I'm very pleased with our growth. This business has real momentum and the overall opportunity is increasing as customers embrace GenAI. We generated Q3 revenues of $11.4 billion, up 35% over last year with operating margins of 17%. Our technology leadership and AI portfolio are helping us attract new customers, win larger deals and drive 30% deeper product adoption with existing customers. Customers are using our products in five different ways. First, our AI infrastructure, which we differentiate with leading performance driven by storage, compute and software advances, as well as leading reliability and a leading number of accelerators. Using a combination of our TPUs and GPUs, LG AI research reduced inference processing time for its multimodal model by more than 50% and operating costs by 72%. Second, our enterprise AI platform, Vertex, is used to build and customize the best foundation models from Google and the industry. Gemini API calls have grown nearly 40x in a 6-month period. When Snap was looking to power more innovative experiences within their My AI chatbot, they chose Gemini's strong multimodal capabilities. Since then, Snap saw over 2.5 times as much engagement with My AI in the United States. Third, customers use our AI platform together with our data platform, BigQuery, because we analyze multimodal data no matter where it is stored with ultra-low latency access to Gemini. This enables accurate real-time decision-making for customers like Hiscox, one of the flagship syndicates in Lloyd's of London, which reduced the time it took to code complex risks from days to minutes. These types of customer outcomes, which combine AI with data science have led to 80% growth in BigQuery ML operations over a 6-month period. Fourth, our AI-powered cybersecurity solutions, Google Threat Intelligence and Security operations are helping customers like BBVA and Deloitte prevent, detect and respond to cybersecurity threats much faster. We have seen customer adoption of our Mandiant-powered threat detection increased 4x over the last 6 quarters. Fifth, in Q3, we broadened our applications portfolio with the introduction of our new customer engagement suite. It's designed to improve the customer experience online and in mobile apps, as well as in call centers, retail stores and more. A great example is Volkswagen of America, who is using this technology to power its new myVW Virtual Assistant. In addition, the employee agents we delivered through Gemini for Google Workspace are getting superb reviews. 75% of daily users say it improves the quality of their work. Moving now to YouTube. For the first time ever, YouTube's combined ad and subscription revenue over the past four quarters has surpassed $50 billion. Together, YouTube TV, NFL Sunday Ticket and YouTube Music Premium are driving subscription growth for the platform. And we are leaning into the living room experience with multi-view and a new option for creators to organize content into episodes and seasons, similar to traditional TV. At Made on YouTube, we announced that Google DeepMind's most capable model for video generation VO is coming to YouTube Shorts to help creators later this year. Next, platforms and devices. Gemini's deep integration is improving Android. For example, Gemini Live lets you have free flowing conversations with Gemini. People love it. It's available on Android, including Samsung Galaxy devices. We continue to work closely with them to deliver innovations across their newest devices with much more to come. At Made by Google, we unveiled our latest Pixel 9 series of devices featuring advanced AI models, including Gemini Nano. We have seen strong demand for these devices, and they've already received multiple awards. Turning to Other Bets. I want to highlight Waymo, the biggest part of our portfolio. Waymo is now a clear technical leader within the autonomous vehicle industry and creating a growing commercial opportunity. Over the years, Waymo has been infusing cutting-edge AI into its work. Now each week, Waymo is driving more than 1 million fully autonomous miles and serves over 150,000 paid rides. The first time any AV company has reached this kind of mainstream use. Through its expanded network and operations partnership with Uber in Austin and Atlanta, plus a new multiyear partnership with Hyundai, Waymo will bring fully autonomous driving to more people and places. By developing a universal driver, Waymo has multiple paths to market. And with its sixth generation system, Waymo significantly reduced unit costs without compromising safety. Before I close, I'm delighted to welcome our new CFO, Anat. We are thrilled to have her on board, and you will hear from her shortly. And as always, I want to express my gratitude to our employees worldwide. Your dedication and hard work have made this another exceptional quarter for Alphabet. Now over to you, Philipp. Philipp Schindler : Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I'll start with performance for the quarter and then describe the progress we're seeing across ads, YouTube and partnerships, highlighting the impact AI is already having on our business. Google Services delivered revenues of $76.5 billion for the quarter, up 13% year-on-year. Search and other revenues grew 12% year-on-year, led by growth in the financial services vertical due to strength in insurance, followed by retail. YouTube ads revenues grew 12% year-on-year, driven by brand, closely followed by direct response. Network revenues were down 2% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms and devices, year-on-year revenues were up 28%, driven by growth in subscriptions as well as the launch of our Made by Google devices in the third quarter. Before I double-click into ads, YouTube and partnerships, a few comments on search. Whether they're using their voice to find answers on the go or opening their camera to explore the world around them, people are expanding how they ask questions in search as well as the type of questions they ask. New behaviors create new opportunities to help us connect businesses and consumers via amazing commercial experiences. As GenAI expands what's possible, we continue to see a significant opportunity in search. Let me take a minute to explain why. AI really supercharges search. Our new AI-powered features make searches more helpful, and we continue to see great feedback, particularly from younger users. For example, with Circle to Search, where we see higher engagement from users aged 18 to 24. AI is expanding our ability to understand intent and connect it to our advertisers. This allows us to connect highly relevant users with the most helpful ad and deliver business impact to our customers. Let me share two new ad experiences we have rolled out alongside our popular AI-powered features in search. First, as you heard from Sundar, every month, Lens is used for almost 20 billion visual searches with 1 in 4 of these searches having commercial intent. In early October, we announced product search on Google Lens. And in testing this feature, we found that shoppers are more likely to engage with content in this new format. We're also seeing that people are turning to Lens more often to run complex multimodal queries, voicing a question or inputting text in addition to a visual. Given these new user behaviors, earlier this month, we announced the rollout of shopping ads above and alongside relevant Lens visual search results to help better connect consumers and businesses. Second, AI Overviews, where we have now started showing search and shopping ads within the overview for mobile users in the U.S. As you remember, we've already been running ads above and below AI Overviews. We're now seeing that people find ads directly within AI Overviews helpful because they can quickly connect with relevant businesses, products and services to take the next step at the exact moment they need. As I've said before, we believe AI will revolutionize every part of the marketing value chain. Let's start with creative. Advertisers now use our Gemini-powered tools to build and test a larger variety of relevant creatives at scale. Audi used our AI tools to generate multiple video image and text assets in different links and orientations out of existing long-form videos. It then fed the newly generated creatives into demand gen to drive reach, traffic and booking to their driving experience. The campaign increased website visits by 80% and increased clicks by 2.7 times, delivering a lift in their sales. Last week, we updated image generation at Google Ads with our most advanced text-to-image model, Imagine 3, which we tuned using ads performance data from multiple industries to help customers produce high-quality imagery for their campaigns. Advertisers can now create even higher-performing assets for PMax, Demand Gen app and Display campaigns. Turning to media buying. AI-powered campaigns help advertisers get faster feedback on what creatives work, where and redirect their media buying. Using Demand Gen, DoorDash tested a mix of image and video assets to drive more impact across Google and YouTube's visually immersive surfaces. They saw a 15 times higher conversion rate at a 50% more efficient cost per action when compared to video action campaigns alone. Last and most importantly, measurement. This quarter, we extended availability of our open source marketing mix model, Meridian to more customers, helping to scale measurement of cross-channel budgets to drive better business outcomes. On YouTube, we remain focused on building a platform that enables creators to thrive and unlocking a whole new world of creativity with AI. Creators are at the heart of the YouTube ecosystem and the content they are making is driving robust growth in watch time across the platform. We're also using AI to greatly improve recommendations on YouTube. Driven by Gemini, our large language models have a deeper understanding of video content and viewers' preferences. As a result, they can recommend more relevant, fresher and personalized content to the viewer. Short-form creation continues to thrive on YouTube. Shorts monetization improved again this quarter, and we continue to significantly close the gap with in-stream video, particularly in the U.S. and other more highly monetizing markets. Of all the channels uploading to YouTube each month, 70% are uploading shorts. And we recently announced a top requested feature, the ability to upload shorts up to 3 minutes long. Also, advertisers can now book first position on Shorts blocks in close to 40 markets. We're unlocking more opportunities in the living room. Our momentum here continues as we maintain our status as the number one streamer in the U.S. according to Nielsen. This is driven by the strength of our creators, such as Michelle Carr and Rhett & Link, who are increasingly crafting experiences designed specifically for the big screen, and it's paying off. The number of creators making the majority of the YouTube revenue on TV screens is up more than 30% year-on-year. YouTube is becoming a premier destination for sports watching. People come for the game and stay for the commentary and around the game content from creators like Evelyn Gonzalez, Adam W and Brad Coleman. During the Olympics, content from Paris 2024 had over 12 billion views on YouTube. More than 850 million unique viewers watched over 40 billion minutes of content with 35% on their TV screens. And recently, we kicked off our second season of NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV, which continues to receive a positive reception from advertisers, our partners at the NFL and fans. We have continued to invest in our product experience with improvements to multiview and deeper integrations for fantasy football fans. Following up on my remarks from last quarter about Brandcast, we had a strong upfront performance with commitments up about 20% year-on-year. As always, let me wrap with the strong momentum we're seeing in partnerships. More and more of our partners are recognizing the breadth of our technologies and building solutions that leverage the very best of Google. For example, our recently announced strategic partnership with Vodafone Group spans Google Cloud, AI, Android ads and digital services. This multibillion-dollar partnership will bring these technologies to more than 330 million customers across Europe and Africa. We are collaborating on more than 30 initiatives across 7 areas, including generative AI from consumers, a best-in-class TV platform, hardware and cybersecurity. With that, a heartfelt thank you to Google everywhere for their extraordinary commitment and to our customers and partners for their continued collaboration and trust. Anat, welcome to the team. It's great to have you with us. Over to you. Anat Ashkenazi : Thank you, Philipp. And thanks, Sundar, for the words of welcome. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with the results at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with high-level commentary on investment at the Alphabet level. We had another strong quarter in Q3 with robust momentum across the business. Consolidated revenue increased by 15% or 16% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth, followed by a robust 35% growth in cloud. Total cost of revenue was $36.5 billion, up 10%. Tech was $13.7 billion, up 9%. We continue to see a revenue mix shift with Google Search growing at double-digit levels, while network revenue, which have a much higher TAC rate declined. Other cost of revenue was $22.8 billion, up 11%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, an increase in depreciation associated with higher level of investment in our technical infrastructure and higher hardware costs associated with the pull forward of our Made by Google launches from the fourth to the third quarter. Total operating expenses increased 5% to $23.3 billion. The increase was primarily driven by facilities-related charges as results of actions were taken to further optimize our office space footprint globally, followed by depreciation, partially offset by year-on-year decline in charges for legal and other matters. R&D investments increased by 11%, primarily driven by increases in compensation and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased 5%, primarily reflecting investment in advertising and promotional efforts related to the Made by Google launches, as well as for AI and Gemini. G&A expenses declined by 10%, primarily due to lower charges for legal and other matters. Operating income increased 34% to $28.5 billion and operating margin increased to 32%. Net income increased 34% to $26.3 billion and earnings per share increased 37% to $2.12. We're pleased with the progress we're making in reengineering our cost structure, which is reflected in our operating margin expansion this quarter, while also continuing to invest in the business to bring innovation to consumers, creators and enterprises. We delivered free cash flow of $17.6 billion for the third quarter and $55.8 billion for the trailing 12 months. Year-on-year free cash flow was negatively impacted by the following items. In 2023, we deferred cash tax payments from the second and third quarter to the fourth quarter. And in Q3 2024, we made a $3 billion cash payment related to the 2017 EC shopping fine. We ended the quarter with $93 billion in cash and marketable securities. Now turning to segment results. Google Services revenue increased 13% to $76.5 billion. Google Search and other advertising revenue increased by 12% to $49.4 billion. The robust performance of search was broad-based across verticals, led by the financial services vertical due to strength in insurance followed by retail. YouTube advertising revenue increased 12% to $8.9 billion, driven by brand, followed by direct response advertising. As Philipp mentioned, we're seeing strong momentum in YouTube, including robust growth in watch time across the platform and are excited about the new features and products we're bringing to creators. Network advertising revenue of $7.5 billion were down 2%. In the third quarter, the year-on-year growth in all our advertising revenue lines was impacted by the increase in strength in advertising revenue in Q3 of last year, in part from APAC-based retailers. Subscription platforms and devices revenue increased 28% to $10.7 billion, reflecting growth in subscription revenues, as well as the launch of our Made by Google devices in the third quarter. We continue to have significant growth in our subscription products, driven primarily by YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium, as well as Google One, primarily due to increases in the number of paid subscribers. With regards to platforms, we're pleased with the performance in play, primarily driven by an increase in buyers. Google Service operating income increased by 29% to $30.9 billion, and operating margin was 40%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which continued to deliver very strong results this quarter. Revenue increased by 35% to $11.4 billion in the third quarter, reflecting accelerated growth in GCP across AI infrastructure, generative AI solutions and core GCP products. Once again, GCP grew at a rate that was higher than cloud overall. We also saw strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. As you just heard from Sundar, the robust innovation and expanded AI offerings within our cloud business are allowing existing and new customers to realize measurable business benefits, including reduced cost, greater customer engagement, faster response time and better revenue conversion. Google Cloud operating income increased to $1.9 billion and operating margin increased to 17%. The operating margin expansion was driven by strong revenue performance across cloud AI products, core GCP and Workspace, as well as ongoing efficiency initiatives. As to our Other Bets, for the third quarter revenue were $388 million and operating loss was $1.1 billion. I'll highlight just a couple of accomplishments in the quarter for Waymo and Wing. We're excited about the progress we're seeing in Waymo, as Sundar mentioned, and the increase in the number of paid rides. We're planning to continue to expand our geographic coverage and reach more customers in existing markets and new markets. Wing, our drone delivery company, recently passed the 1-year anniversary of scaling its partnership with Walmart in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, now operating in 11 stores and serving 26 different cities and towns. Turning to Alphabet level activities. The largest component of this line is our investment in AI research and development activities, which support all of Alphabet. There were two notable items that impacted the operating loss in Alphabet level activities. First, a $607 million charge related to decisions we've made to further optimize our physical footprint and office space globally; and second, our ongoing investments in AI R&D, including the full quarter effect of the organizational changes we've made in May to move some additional AI teams from Google Services to Google DeepMind. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the third quarter was $13 billion, reflecting investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component being investment in servers, followed by data centers and networking equipment. Looking ahead, we expect quarterly CapEx in the fourth quarter to be at similar levels to Q3, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx. Our expansion of data center capacity is expected to bring economic benefits to countries and communities where we are investing. In the third quarter alone, we made announcements of over $7 billion in planned data center investments with nearly $6 billion of that in the U.S. In Q3, we also returned value to shareholders in the form of $15.3 billion in share repurchases and $2.5 billion in dividend payments. Overall, we returned a total of nearly $70 billion over the trailing 12 months to shareholders. As we look forward, we're working to balance our investments in AI and other growth areas with the cost discipline needed to fund those activities. As we think about the remainder of 2024, there are a couple of dynamics to consider. In terms of revenue, year-on-year growth in advertising revenue will continue to be impacted by the increasing strength in advertising revenue in the second half of 2023, in part from APAC-based retailers. And there will be a headwind to year-over-year growth in subscription platforms and devices revenue in the fourth quarter due to the pull forward of our Made by Google launches into the third quarter this year. In terms of expenses, we'll continue to see increases in depreciation and expenses associated with higher level of investment in our technical infrastructure, partially offset by a slight benefit from the cost revenue associated with our devices due to the pull forward of hardware launches into Q3. Now before going into Q&A, as the new CFO, I would like to share a few thoughts on how I'm approaching and thinking through growth, cost structure and capital allocation and expect to hear more from me on these topics in the coming quarters. As I look at the business, I see opportunities for further growth propelled by AI and the underlying momentum across the business. You heard about some of these on the call today. I also believe that we are well positioned to deliver meaningful innovation, which will translate to revenue given our strength in the core pillars that are required to succeed in AI at scale. Realizing those opportunities and great innovation in AI requires global reach, which we have through our products and platforms, as well as continued meaningful capital investment. And while we have a strong balance sheet to be able to support these investments, we will be looking for efficiencies so that we can fund innovation in priority areas. Sundar, Ruth and our leadership team started important work to reengineer our cost structure including efforts such as optimizing our headcount growth, our physical footprint, improving the efficiencies of our technical infrastructure and streamlining operations across the company through the use of AI. I plan to build on these efforts, but also evaluate where we might be able to accelerate work and where we might need to pivot to free up capital for more attractive opportunities. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have a two-parter, Sundar. The first one, over the course of the last year plus, you've sort of showcased a lot of different types of new GenAI enabled search products to sort of reimagine the search experience. Can you help us hone in on one or two 0these products that you're most excited about that you think over the next 2 to 3 years could really lead to more durable multiyear search growth once they scale? And then the second one, just as we're sort of thinking through constraints to how quickly they come out, what are sort of the key constraints that you see to really reimagining search and scaling it out across 2 billion to 3 billion people? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Brian. Great question. Look, it's been an extraordinary year of innovation. I mentioned in my remarks about Circle to Search Lens now with video search approaching over 20 billion queries a month and obviously, AI Overviews. And with each of these changes, we are definitely expanding what's possible in search. And it's been really heartening to see users adapt. They understand they can ask more queries. They come back more often. And so - and we have seen growth there. I think we are with very - while we've rolled out AI Overviews to over 1 billion users, there is a lot more innovation there we are actively working on. So I expect search to continue to evolve significantly in 2025, both in the search product and in Gemini. And so I think that's the opportunity ahead. I think we are in early days of what is a powerful new technology. And with it, I think we can do a lot more for our users, but at the same time, underpin it on the foundational bedrock of quality and trust and user experience, which we have always done. So we are at 1 billion people. I don't necessarily see a constraint there. Obviously, things like latency, cost per query, et cetera. But as you've seen us over the past 18 months make substantial progress. So we'll continue rolling it out more, and we'll keep evolving it. I think search, if I were to take a 12-month outlook, I think is going to continue to evolve and we'll be at the forefront of that innovation. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Doug Anmuth : All right. Thanks for taking the question. Perhaps for Sundar and Anat. Can you talk more about the infrastructure advantages and CapEx efficiencies you've generated from Google's own TPUs? And how does that influence your CapEx spending going forward relative to peers and other leading cloud service providers? Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Doug. I'll take the first part and Anat can give color on the CapEx spending part. Look, I think one of the - we are well positioned because in our AI infrastructure, we have a comprehensive solution set, right? We have all the leading AI accelerators GPUs, TPUs as well as CPUs, and we are investing in all of them. We have a wonderful partnership with NVIDIA. We are excited for the GB200s, and we'll be one of the first to provide it at scale. On the TPU front, I think we have - not only are we in our sixth generation. I just spent some time with the teams on the road map ahead. I couldn't be more excited at the forward-looking road map, but all of it allows us to both plan ahead in the future and really drive an optimized architecture for it. And I think because of all this, both we can have best-in-class efficiency, not just for internal at Google, but what we can provide through cloud, and that's reflected in the growth we saw in our AI infrastructure and GenAI services on top of it. So I'm pretty excited about how we are set up, and we'll continue executing there. And maybe Anat can give comments on the CapEx spending. Anat Ashkenazi : Yeah, sure. So let me provide a little more color on our capital investments and certainly an important area in the - this time of investments in AI. As you saw in the quarter, we invested $13 billion in CapEx across the company. And as you think about it, really it's divided into two categories. One is our technical infrastructure, and that's the majority of that $13 billion. And the other one goes into areas such as facilities, the Bets and other areas across the company. Within TI, we have investments in servers, which includes both TPUs and GPUs. And then the second categories are data centers and networking equipment. This quarter, approximately 60% of that investment in technical infrastructure went towards servers and about 40% towards data center and networking equipment. And as you think about them, we offer both GPUs and TPUs both internally and to our customers. So we have choices and options based on what our customer needs and what our internal needs are. And as you think about the next quarter and going into next year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we will be investing in Q4 at approximately the same level of what we've invested in Q3, approximately $13 billion. And as we think into 2025, we do see an increase coming in 2025, and we will provide more color on that on the Q4 call, likely not the same percent step-up that we saw between '23 and '24, but additional increase. Sundar Pichai : The one other thing I would add on the - Doug, on your first part of the question on the TPUs is if you look at the flash pricing we have been able to deliver externally, I think - and how much more attractive it is compared to other models of that capability, I think probably that gives a good sense of the efficiencies we can generate from our architecture. And so - and we are doing the same that for internal use as well. The models for search, while they keep going up in capability, we've been able to really optimize them for the underlying architecture, and that's where we are seeing a lot of efficiencies as well. Doug Anmuth : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan : Thank you for taking the question. And Anat congrats on the new role. And welcome to Alphabet. Sundar, maybe one for you on Waymo. What are the key learnings as Waymo has rolled out to additional cities in terms of consumer adoption of the product and how you think about go-to-market strategies for Waymo? And then maybe one for Philipp. In terms of looking at YouTube trends by long-form versus short-form video or shorts, how are you seeing consumption versus monetization trends continue to evolve for YouTube as broken down maybe in that means? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Eric. On Waymo, obviously, it's been an exciting year, both in the Phoenix market and in San Francisco. We've definitely scaled and particularly scaled paid rides and definitely surprised us on the positive in terms of how much consumers are loving the experience from a safety standpoint, privacy standpoint, reliability standpoint, et cetera. So I think all of that has been on the positive side. And obviously, the product will continue to improve. So for us, we are mainly focused on each city as we go, the pace at which we can now do additional city gets easier. So we are definitely accelerating that way. That's why we - you've seen us move into L.A. We're also striking partnerships in newer and unique ways. Hence, the Uber partnership and expansion to Austin and Atlanta. And we have more options where we are looking at the driven by Waymo model with other network partners, fleet managers, et cetera. So it's an exciting moment, but we are still obviously being safety focused, but are looking to scale and testing out a variety of models and which will help us plan ahead well for 2025 and beyond. Philipp Schindler : Yes. And to your question on YouTube Shorts, consumption versus monetization, maybe we start with the watch time. It continues to grow actually across YouTube with particular strength in shorts and in the living room. Just to give you a number, over 70 billion YouTube Shorts are watched every day. On the monetization side, the monetization rate of shorts relative to in-stream viewing is continuing to show a healthy rate of growth. The gap continues to narrow, particularly in the U.S. We also see it in other more highly monetizing markets. And we continue to work very closely with our advertisers. We're committed to providing them with very effective ways to reach the growing audience here. I talked about advertisers now being able to book first position on Shorts blocks. That's exciting. Shorts are also integrated into video reach campaigns, YouTube Select. So you're really giving brands the precise targeting options here. So yeah, we are pleased with the progress we're making here. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open. Ross Sandler : Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats, Anat. Two, if that's okay. So first, Sundar, given the high stakes around native AI product usage, are there any milestones you can share around where Gemini usage is compared to the 250 million weekly active users that ChatGPT is seeing right now? And then the second question is, I'm sure this is something you guys have been thinking about for a while, but it looks like the way that the Google versus DOJ search trial is going, there's a decent likelihood that the Apple ISA contract and some of the Android pre-install contracts are going to be voided out at some point in the future. So I guess the question is, what plans do we have in place to recapture some of the usage that might be going away in those search access points? How can we gain share on iOS queries if the Safari toolbar access point were to change? Thank you very much. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Ross. Look, I think, you know, obviously, we are serving Gemini across a lot of touch points, including it's now over 1 billion people are using it in search accessing. We are getting it across our products. The Gemini app itself has very strong momentum on user growth. Our API volume, I commented on the Gemini APIs having gone up 14x in the past 6 months. So we are seeing growth across the board. And the Gemini integration into Google Assistant is going super well on Android. The user feedback is positive. So we are continuing to roll that out more. So I think we'll - you will see us we are investing in the next generation of models. And as part of that, we are investing in scaling up the usage of the - both directly to the models as both on the consumer and the developer side. So I think I'm pleased with the momentum there. On the second - on the legal trials, obviously, I don't want to - it's not appropriate for me to speculate given it's in the middle of ongoing litigation. But what I would say is stepping back, look, we've always and even as the court acknowledged, clearly, we have reached a position of success because we have deeply innovated, and we are continuing to do so. People have chosen us because they view it as the best product, be it consumers or partners. And we have a long track record of working hard to make sure our products are as easily available to users as possible across all platforms. So all that approach and all the learnings over the years, I think, will all be - will give us a strong foundation. First of all, we plan to vigorously defend these cases. And some of the early proposals from the DOJ, et cetera, have been far reaching. And we plan to - I think they could have unintended consequences, particularly to the dynamic tech sector and the American leadership there. And so we plan to be - we plan to engage very vigorously there. Thanks. Ross Sandler : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Justin Post with BAML. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit more about AI Overviews, maybe two parts. You mentioned you're seeing increasing queries or activity. Could you help us understand that for the billion users who have had access to the product, what you're seeing there? And then on the monetization side, is there a chance that AI Overviews would help monetize some of the information queries that maybe you weren't making much monetization from with old formats? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Justin. Look, I think the main thing I would say is as we have rolled out, we're obviously now scaling it out. We just rolled it out to 100 new countries and territories, and that's what will get us to billion users. But amongst the users where we had already rolled out, we clearly see strong engagement. It's one of the most positive user satisfaction launches we have done in search. And it is increasing overall search usage, like people are asking more complex questions, different types of questions. They are exploring a wider range of websites. And what's particularly exciting is that this growth actually increases over time as people learn to adapt to that new behavior. So I'll stick to those comments. And I think - to the second part of your question on the monetization side, I think Philipp can answer more of that. Philipp? Philipp Schindler : Yeah. So look, the transition here is working well, including for ads. As you know, we recently launched ads within AI Overviews on mobile in the U.S. And this really builds on our previous rollout of ads above and below the AI Overviews. So overall, for AI Overviews, we see monetization at approximately the same rate, which gives us a really strong base on which we can innovate even more. And specifically to your question of monetizing queries where we can monetization potentially at the moment, yes, I can see that there is opportunity for that. Justin Post : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Michael Nathanson : Thanks. I have one for Sundar. Sundar, there was this perception and even false that Alphabet was not as innovative on AI as they should. And it clearly shows that that was wrong. You're moving pretty quickly rolling out new products. Can you talk a bit about how you may have changed your structure? I know you've combined some assets, but talk a bit about how you've maybe rethought how you go to market with some of your innovation products? And maybe what's changed operationally as AI has picked up steam for you guys? Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Michael. Look, I definitely think it's an extraordinary opportunity. And I think the company, given the important moment, we had to gear up to build models from scratch that could be productionized at scale on our architecture. And that's what the Gemini era was about. So there was a fixed cost of getting it all set up and getting the Gemini era underway. But now I think we are in much more of a virtuous cycle with a lot of velocity in the underlying models. We've had two generations of Gemini model. We are working on the third generation, which is progressing well. And teams internally are now set up much better to consume the underlying model innovation and translate that into innovation within their products. So now all the seven products, which have 2 billion users each have done their first versions of incorporating Gemini, and there is aggressive road map ahead for 2025. I mentioned earlier, search alone. I think there's a lot more we can do. And we are also enabling smaller teams to ship newer experiences and Notebook LM was the first instantiation of those types of efforts as well. Through it all, within, we had to do this when the company evolved from desktop to mobile. We are restructuring the company. Effectively, if you think of Google as a neural network, we are forming new synapses, which work much better to adapt to this moment. And I think that sets us up well for the year ahead. And we are bringing all of this innovation to the outside world through cloud as well. And so we are going to do that. And so that's an additional opportunity at this moment. Michael Nathanson : Thanks, Sundar. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Okay. I'd like to ask two questions, please, to Anat. First, the margins at cloud have really started to ramp nicely. There are comps in the industry with still materially higher operating margins. I imagine that's a matter of scale and trying to catch up from a third place position. But how do you think about the margin trends that you're seeing? And what's your level of confidence that those margins can kind of match up to other industry players that are doing closer to 30% margins? And then secondly, just across the board, when you think about the business that's running at, what, 32% operating margins this last quarter, and you come in looking at this fresh, is it clear to you that there are a lot of kind of newfound cost efficiencies or ongoing cost efficiencies? Like what do you see as the biggest opportunities to kind of take those margins and maybe over time, take them materially higher? Thank you very much. Anat Ashkenazi : Thanks, Mark, for both of these questions. Let me start on the cloud margin. So certainly, very pleased to see not just the top line growth rate, but the margin expansion to 17%, really outstanding work by our cloud team to drive continued benefit to customers. And as you think about that margin expansion, really, it's a few things. You've mentioned one of them. The first is scale. Obviously, as we scale the business, we have more opportunity for margin expansion. But the second, and shouldn't be underestimated is the work the team has done to drive efficiencies across the cloud business, and we're seeing those come through, whether it's through headcount management or facilities management, other process efficiencies. We're seeing that go to the bottom line and driving the results you're seeing this quarter. Hard to obviously compare to any of our peers or competitors. It's a different business, but more to come. Now the one thing to remember, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, this is an area that requires investment. And a lot of these investments, you think about servers, et cetera, is based on demand we're seeing from customers. So this will translate to revenue in the fairly short term. But that means there are headwinds associated with the - overall, the annual run rate or costs associated with these investments, whether it's in the form of depreciation or just construction costs that are not capitalized, et cetera. So we'll continue to drive efficiency in the business to try and offset some of these. But this is how I'm thinking about the dynamics for cloud. Overall, for the business, this is one of my key priorities is to look across the organization to see what we can do in terms of driving further efficiencies. There's really good work that was done started by Ruth, Sundar and the rest of the lead team to reengineer the cost base. But I think any organization can always push a little further. And I'll be looking at additional opportunities really across all the elements that I've mentioned in my prepared remarks, think not just about the size of the organization, but mostly how we operate and how we run the business. And I think when you simplify the organization, Sundar just made a few comments on that. When we use AI within our own processes and how we get work done, there are some efficiencies or opportunities for efficiencies. Now all of that will go against substantial increases in capital investment, as I've mentioned, going into 2025. And again, I'll give more color when we are on the Q4 call. So hopefully, we'll be able to drive efficiencies to work towards offsetting some or all of that increase. Mark Mahaney : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Ken Gawrelski : Thank you so much. Two, if I may. First, just on search, why does it make sense to have completely - why doesn't it make sense to have two completely different search experiences. One, an agent-like answers engine, and then two, a links-based more traditional search engine. You could innovate on both and let the consumer decide. It's - maybe think of it as the ultimate A/B test. So I'd be curious to get your thoughts there. And then the second, if you could touch a little bit on the consumer environment in 4Q. Perhaps nobody has a better view into the health of the consumer in multiple verticals. If you could talk a little bit about - you talked about tougher comps on the Asia e-commerce side, but any other trends you could point out be around the election or fewer holiday days this year, that would be really helpful. Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Why don't I take the first part and then Philipp can give color on the consumer vertical trends. On the first part, look, in this moment, people are using a lot of buzzwords like answer engines and all that stuff. I mean, Google started answering questions about 10 years ago in our search product with featured snippets. So look, I think ultimately, you are serving users. User expectations are constantly evolving. And we work hard to stay a step ahead, anticipate and stay a step ahead. And this is why we've kind of really brought multimodality on the input side and the output side in search pretty natively. And so we'll continue expanding innovations there. I do think having two surfaces for us allows us to experiment more. And there are - I view this moment as moment in which there are new use cases which we will be able to do, which we couldn't have done before. And so having the flexibility, having product surfaces where we can move very, very fast, I think, is actually helpful. And so we are embracing it and going to lean into this moment like we have done in the past year, and I think that will play out well for users. Philipp? Philipp Schindler : Yes. On the vertical trends, look, I called out search and other revenues being led by growth in the financial services due to improved economics in the insurance industry, followed by retail. But I think it's fair to say, in general, we saw broad-based strength across all verticals, maybe specifically to election-related ad spend. We had a slight tailwind from election-related ad spend in the third quarter, which was a little bit more pronounced in YouTube ads. Operator : And our last question comes from Stephen Ju with UBS. Your line is now open. Stephen Ju : Thank you so much. Hi, Sundar. I think in two separate blog posts from Google Cloud, talking about the real-life use cases for GenAI, I think you highlighted what was a pretty material increase in a number of companies that are starting to turn their, I guess, ideas into products. I think it was like an 80% increase in the 6-month period. And I think you guys also published some survey data saying that your customers are generating tangible ROI there. So can you update us on what you're seeing in terms of sales cycles, perhaps accelerating? And how much of the heavy lifting the cloud team may have to do to help your customers turn those ideas into reality more quickly? And Philipp, I think one of the feedbacks that we're getting from advertisers is that while the initial use case for PMax for them was in search, they're starting to use it more and more for mid and upper funnel campaigns and budgets as well. So can you talk about whether that's an anecdote or something that you're already seeing perpetuate among all of your advertisers? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : On the cloud side, look, I think you - sorry, on the cloud side, look, I do think you hinted in your question itself. Definitely, customers are leaning in this moment, wherever we have been working, we are definitely seeing real concrete proof points delivering real impact, right, be it in their user experience, be it in the bottom line, et cetera. And so I gave a few examples on my remarks. And I think customers are getting savvier. We ourselves are going through a lot of learnings, both in deploying this within Google as an enterprise and bringing those learnings to our customers outside. And as we see common patterns across the breadth of sectors we serve in, I think we are bringing those learnings. So I would say, if anything, I think over time, I think organizations are beginning to understand more. They are leaning in. Our models are getting better. We are building more comprehensive solutions on top of it. So I think we are well set up for 2025, and I think there will be continued momentum in this area. Philipp Schindler : And on the PMax side, look, we continue to see success with PMax. And we see those success stories really from large advertisers, from agencies, from SMBs across marketing objectives, across different verticals. It's very cost effective, and it really finds customers wherever they are across all the different Google channels. And with the introduction of Gemini, we added a lot of new features to PMax. For example, to deliver more powerful performance, help advertisers scale, build high-quality creative assets and so on. But going directly to your question on the funnel, also keep in mind, we have a great product with Demand Gen that is all about inspiring consumers beyond the initial awareness and to take action. And we think Demand Gen is actually a very powerful tool to win in today's marketplace with marketers, and we can't wait to see actually what more value it will drive. Stephen Ju : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks. Jim Friedland : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter 2024 call. Thank you, and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jim Friedland : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai; Philipp Schindler; and Anat Ashkenazi. Now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter in Q4, driven by our leadership in AI and our unique full stack. We're making dramatic progress across compute, model capabilities, and in driving efficiencies. We're rapidly shipping product improvements, and seeing terrific momentum with consumer and developer usage. And we're pushing the next frontiers, from AI agents, reasoning and deep research, to state-of-the-art video, quantum computing and more. The company is in a great rhythm and cadence, building, testing, and launching products faster than ever before. This is translating into product usage, revenue growth, and results. In Search, AI overviews are now available in more than 100 countries. They continue to drive higher satisfaction in Search usage. Meanwhile, circle to search is now available on over 200 million android devices. In Cloud and YouTube, we said at the beginning of 2024 that we expected to exit the year at a combined annual revenue run rate of over $100 billion. We met that goal and ended the year at a run rate of $110 billion. We are set up well for continued growth. So today I'll provide an update on our AI progress and how it's improving our core consumer products. Then I'll touch on Cloud, YouTube, Platforms and Devices, and Waymo. Let's start with AI. Last quarter, I outlined the three areas of our differentiated full stack approach to AI innovation. Our leading AI infrastructure, our world-class research, including models and tooling, and our products and platforms that bring these innovations to people at scale. First, AI Infrastructure. Our sophisticated global network of cloud regions and data centers provides a powerful foundation for us and our customers, directly driving revenue. We have a unique advantage, because we develop every component of our technology stack, including hardware, compilers, models, and products. This approach allows us to drive efficiencies at every level, from training and serving, to developer productivity. In 2024, we broke ground on 11 new cloud regions and data center campuses in places like South Carolina, Indiana, Missouri, and around the world. We also announced plans for seven new subsea cable projects, strengthening global connectivity. Our leading infrastructure is also among the world's most efficient. Google data centers deliver nearly 4x more computing power per unit of electricity compared to just 5 years ago. These efficiencies, coupled with the scalability, cost and performance we offer, are why organizations increasingly choose Google cloud's platform. In fact, today, cloud customers consume more than 8x the compute capacity for training and inferencing compared to 18 months ago. We'll continue to invest in our cloud business to ensure we can address the increase in customer demand. Second, world class research including models. In December, we unveiled Gemini 2.0, our most capable AI model yet, built for the agentic era. We launched an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 flash, our workhorse model with low latency and enhanced performance. Flash has already rolled out to the Gemini app, and tomorrow we are making 2.0 flash generally available for developers and customers, along with other model updates. So stay tuned. Late last year, we also debuted our experimental Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Model. The progress-to-scale thinking has been super fast, and the reviews so far have been extremely positive. We are working on even better thinking models and look forward to sharing those with the developer community soon. Gemini 2.0 advances in multi modality and made of tool use enable us to build new agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant. One early example is Deep Research. It uses agentic capabilities to explore complex topics on your behalf, and give key findings, along with sources. It launched in Gemini Advanced in December, and is rolling out to android users all over the world. We are seeing great product momentum with our consumer Gemini app, which debuted on IOS last November. And we have opened up trusted tester access to a handful of research prototypes, including Project Mariner, which can understand and reason across information on a browser screen to complete tasks and Project Astra. We expect to bring features from both to the Gemini app later this year. We're also excited by the progress of our video and image generation models. Veo 2, our state-of-the-art video generation model, and Imagen 3, our highest quality text-to-image model. These generative media models, as well as Gemini, consistently top industry leader boards and score top marks across industry benchmarks. That's why more than 4.4 million developers are using our Gemini models today, double the number from just 6 months ago. And we continue to drive research breakthroughs in quantum computing. At the end of last year, we announced Willow, our new state-of-the-art quantum computing chip that can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using more qubits. Willow is an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications. This technology holds so much promise, which is why there was real excitement around this breakthrough. Third, our Products and Platforms put AI into the hands of billions of people around the world. We have seven Products and Platforms with over 2 billion users and all are using Gemini. That includes Search, where Gemini is powering our AI overviews. People use Search more with AI overviews and usage growth increases over time as people learn that they can ask new types of questions. This behavior is even more pronounced with younger users who really appreciate the speed and efficiency of this new format. We also are pleased to see how Circle to Search is driving additional Search use and opening up even more types of questions. This feature is also popular among younger users. Those who have tried Circle to Search before now use it to start more than 10% of their searches. As AI continues to expand the universe of queries that people can ask, 2025 is going to be one of the biggest years for Search innovation yet. Now, let me turn to key highlights from the quarter across Cloud, YouTube, Platforms and Devices, and Waymo. First, Google Cloud. Our AI-powered cloud offerings enabled us to win customers such as Mercedes-Benz, Mercado Libre and Servier. In 2024, the number of first-time commitments more than doubled, compared to 2023. We also deepened customer relationships. Last year, we closed several strategic deals over $1 billion, and the number of deals over $250 million doubled from the prior year. Our partners are further accelerating our growth, with customers purchasing billions of dollars of solutions through our Cloud marketplace. We continue to see strong growth across our broad portfolio of AI-powered Cloud solutions. It begins with our AI Hypercomputer, which delivers leading performance and cost, across both GPUs and TPUs. These advantages help Citadel with modeling markets and training, and enabled Wayfair to modernize its platform, improving performance and scalability by nearly 25%. In Q4, we saw strong uptake of Trillium, our sixth-generation TPU, which delivers 4x better training performance and 3x greater inference throughput compared to the previous generation. We also continue our strong relationship with NVIDIA. We recently delivered their H200-based platforms to customers and just last week, we were the first to announce a customer running on the highly-anticipated Blackwell platform. Our AI developer platform, Vertex AI, saw a 5x increase in customers year-over-year, with brands like Mondelez International and WPP building new applications and benefitting from our 200+ foundation models. Vertex usage increased 20x during 2024, with particularly strong developer adoption of Gemini Flash, Gemini 2.0, Imagen 3, and most recently, Veo. We are also seeing strong growth in our AI-powered databases, data analytics, and cybersecurity platforms. Customers including Radisson Hotels are now using Gemini to Search and analyze multi-modal data from across multiple Clouds. Our AI-powered Threat Intelligence and Security Operations products help customers, including Vodafone and AstraZeneca, identify, protect and defend against threats. Our growing portfolio of AI applications is also seeing strong customer adoption. In Q4, we introduced Google Agentspace, which helps enterprises synthesize data with Google-quality Search, create Gemini-powered agents, and automate transactions for employees. In addition, we recently gave all Google Workspace Business and Enterprise customers access to all of our powerful Gemini AI capabilities to help boost their productivity. Moving to YouTube. Nielsen data shows YouTube continues to be number one in streaming watchtime in the U.S., with our share of streaming now at a record high. On election day alone, over 45 million viewers across the U.S. watched election-related content on YouTube. Our early investment in podcasts is paying off. We integrated podcasts into the core YouTube experience, particularly with video. We are now the most frequently used service for consuming podcasts in the U.S., according to a recent Edison report. This success reflects our long-term approach of investing in emerging trends, from mobile to the living room. We now have over 250,000 creators in the YouTube Shopping affiliate program in the U.S. and Korea alone. We expanded YouTube Shopping at the end of last year to three additional countries, allowing even more creators to share their favorite products with fans and grow their businesses. Philipp will talk more about YouTube performance later in the call. Next, Platforms and Devices. Google One's performance has been outstanding, and is one of our fastest growing subscription products in terms of subscribers and revenue growth. Last month, we announced the first beta of Android 16, plus new Android updates, including a deeper Gemini integration coming to the new Samsung Galaxy S25 series. We also recently announced Android XR, the first Android platform built for the Gemini era. Created with Samsung and Qualcomm, Android XR is designed to power an ecosystem of next-generation extended reality devices, like headsets and glasses. Finally, a few words on Waymo which made tremendous progress last year, safely serving more than 4 million passenger trips. It is now averaging over 150,000 trips each week, and growing. Looking ahead, Waymo will be expanding its network and operations partnerships to open up new markets, including Austin and Atlanta this year and Miami next year. And in the coming weeks, Waymo One vehicles will arrive in Tokyo for their first international road trip. We're also developing the sixth-generation Waymo Driver, which will significantly lower hardware costs. I want to thank our employees around the world for another great quarter. 2025 is going to be exciting and we\u2019re all ready for it. Philipp, I will hand it over to you. Philipp Schindler : Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I will quickly cover performance for the quarter, then frame the rest of my remarks around the progress we are delivering across Search, Ads, YouTube and Partnerships, highlighting the impact AI is having on our business and our customers. Google Services revenues were $84 billion for the quarter, up 10%, driven primarily by 11% year-on-year growth in advertising revenues. Strong growth in Search and YouTube advertising was partially offset by year-over-year decline in network revenues. In terms of vertical performance, the 13% increase in Search and other revenues was led by financial services followed by retail. The 14% growth in YouTube advertising revenues was driven by strong spend on U.S. election advertising, with combined spend from both parties almost doubling from what we saw in the 2020 elections. Now, in Q4, we saw continued strong growth in revenues from Search. We had lots of exciting updates in December, and we're rapidly integrating our AI innovation into our consumer experiences. We've already started testing Gemini 2.0 in AI overviews and plan to roll it out more broadly later in the year. In Search, we're seeing people increasingly ask entirely new questions using their voice, camera, or in ways that were not possible before, like with Circle to Search. We're making these benefits available to more consumers. Google is already present in over half of journeys where a new brand, product, or retailer are discovered. By offering new ways for people to Search, we're expanding commercial opportunities for our advertisers. Shoppers can now take a photo of a product and, using lens, quickly find information about the product, reviews, similar products, and where they can get it for a great price. Lens is used for over 20 billion visual search queries every month, and the majority of these searches are incremental. Retail was particularly strong this holiday season, especially on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which each generated over $1 billion in ad revenue. Interestingly, despite the U.S. holiday shopping season being the shortest since 2019, retail sales began much earlier, in October, causing the season to extend longer than anticipated. People shop more than a billion times a day across Google. Last quarter, we introduced a reinvented Google shopping experience, rebuilt from the ground up with AI. This December saw roughly 13% more daily active users on Google shopping in the U.S. compared to the same period in 2023. Closing out on Search with travel, and sharing another interesting trend where we saw spend expand to travel Tuesday. This contributed to 20% year-on-year revenue growth for travel advertisers across Cyber Monday and Travel Tuesday. Moving to Ads. We continue investing in AI capabilities across media buying, creative and measurement. As I said before, we believe that AI will revolutionize every part of the marketing value chain, and over the past quarter, we've seen how our customers are increasingly focusing on optimizing their use of AI. As an example, Petco used DemandGen campaigns across targeting, creative generation, and bidding to find new pet parent audiences across YouTube. They achieved a 275% higher return on ad spend and a 74% higher click through rate than their social benchmarks. On media buying, we made YouTube select creator takeovers generally available in the U.S. and will be expanding to more markets this year. Creators know their audience the best and creator takeovers help businesses connect with consumers through authentic and relevant content. Looking at Creative, we introduced new controls and made reporting easier in PMAX, helping customers better understand and reinvest into their best performing assets. Using asset generation in PMAX. Event Ticket Center achieved a 5x increase in production of creative assets, saving time and effort. They also increased convergence by 300% compared to the previous period when they used manual assets. And finally, Measurement. Last week, we made Meridian, our marketing mix model, generally available for customers, helping more business reinvest into creative and media buying strategies that they know work. Based on a Nielsen meta-analysis of marketing mix models, on average, Google AI-powered video campaigns on YouTube deliver 17% higher return on advertising spend than manual campaigns. Turning to YouTube. We saw robust revenue growth backed by continued growth and watch time across ad supported and premium experiences. Our focus here remains on building a streaming platform that enables creators to thrive and unlock the full potential of AI. Expanding on our state-of-the-art video generation model, we announced Veo 2, which creates incredibly high quality video in a wide range of subjects and styles. It's been inspiring to see how people are experimenting with it. We'll make it available to creators on YouTube in the coming months. We continue to invest in helping YouTube creators work with brands. All advertisers globally can now promote YouTube creator videos and ad campaigns across all AI-powered campaign types in Google Ads. And creators can tag partners in their brand videos. Sephora used DemandGen's Shorts-Only channel to boost traffic and brand searches for the Holiday Gift Guide campaign and leverage creator collaborations to find the best gift. This drove an 82% relative uplift in searches for Sephora Holiday. Shorts continues its ascent and is closing the gap with long form. In 2024, the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing increased by more than 30 percentage points in the U.S., and we expect to make additional progress in 2025. We're making it easier for advertisers to benefit from Shorts on all screens. We're particularly excited by its success on connected TV, which now makes up 15% of shorts viewing in the U.S. Using a combination of ad formats, Louis Vuitton reached their overall objectives on both long-form and short-form content. Their shorts exceeded luxury goods benchmark for average view duration by 89% for equivalent video lengths, while their long-form content exceeded the benchmark by over 15%, with strong engagement from Gen Z and Millennials. Looking into the living room, we continue to be number one in streaming watch time in the U.S for nearly two years, according to Nielsen, and our share of streaming is at a record high. Viewers globally streamed over 1 billion hours of YouTube content daily on their TVs in 2024. YouTube makes multi-year investments to tap into shifting consumer behavior. The current surge in living room viewership directly reflects years of work to build the right products and partnerships. Creators are now prioritizing high-quality viewing experiences that truly shine on TV screens, inspiring even more viewers to tune in. In fact, the number of creators making majority of revenue from TV is up over 30% year-on-year. We have also invested in podcasts, where popular shows like Club Shay Shay and Lex Friedman are increasingly a visual format. YouTube creators and viewers are embracing this. In 2024, people watched over 400 million hours of podcasts each month on living room devices alone. YouTube is now the most popular service for podcast listening in the U.S., according to Edison. As always, let me wrap with the strong momentum we're seeing in partnerships, where the breadth of what Google has to offer is increasingly being recognized. Sundar mentioned our deepening partnership with Samsung. Another expanding partnership is with Citi, who is modernizing its technology infrastructure with Google Cloud to transform employee and customer experiences. Using Google Cloud, it will improve its digital products, streamline employee workflows, and use advanced high-performance computing to enable millions of daily computations. This partnership also fuels Citi's generative AI initiatives across customer service, document summarization, and search to reduce manual processing. With that, allow me a moment to thank Googlers everywhere for their extraordinary commitment and to our customers and partners for their continued trust. Anat, over to you. Anat Ashkenazi : Thank you, Philipp. We're pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing across the business as Alphabet revenue for 2024 reached $350 billion, up 14% on a reported basis and 15% in constant currency versus 2023. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with the results at the Alphabet level and we'll then cover our segment results. I'll end with some commentary and expectations over the first quarter and full year 2025. We had another strong quarter in Q4 with robust momentum across the business. Consolidated revenue of $96.5 billion, increased by 12% in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth, followed by Cloud. Total cost of revenue was $40.6 billion, up 8%. Tech was $14.8 billion, up 6%. We continue to see a revenue mix shift with Google Search growing at double-digit levels, while network revenues, which have a much higher tech rate, declined. Other cost of revenue was $25.8 billion, up 9%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisitions costs, primarily for YouTube, followed by depreciation, due to increasing investments in our technical infrastructure. Growth in content acquisition and depreciation were partially offset by our year-over-year decline in hardware costs due to the shift in timing of our made-by-Google launches to the third quarter 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. In terms of total expenses, the year-over-year comparisons reflect $1.2 billion in exit charges that we took in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with actions to optimize our global office space. As previously disclosed, those charges were allocated across the expense lines in other costs of revenue and OpEx based on associated headcount. Total operating expenses decreased 1% to $24.9 billion. R&D investments increased by 8%, primarily driven by increase in compensation and depreciation expenses, partially offset by the impact of charges for office [ph] space optimization in the fourth quarter of 2023. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 5%, primarily reflecting the optimization charges last year, as well as declines in compensation and in ads and promotion expenses due to the timing shift of the Pixel launch from Q4 to Q3. G&A expenses declined by 15%, reflecting a shift of timing in our charitable contributions, as well as the optimization charges last year. Operating income increased 31%, the score [ph] to $31 billion, and operating margin increased to 32%, representing 4.6 points of margin expansion. Net income increased 28% to $26.5 billion, and earnings per share increased 31% to $2.15. We delivered free cash flow of $24.8 billion in the fourth quarter and $72.8 billion for the full year 2024. We ended the quarter with $96 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Google Service revenues increased 10% to $84.1 billion, reflecting the strong momentum across Google Search and YouTube ads. Google Search and other advertising revenues increased by 13% to $54 billion. The robust performance of Search was once again broad-based across verticals, led by the financial service vertical due to strength in insurance, followed by retail. YouTube advertising revenue increased 14% to $10.5 billion, driven by brand, followed by direct response advertising. Network advertising revenue of $8 billion, were down 4%. In the fourth quarter, the year-over-year comparison in all of our advertising revenue lines was impacted by the increase in strength in advertising revenue in Q4 2023, in part from APAC-based retailers. Subscription platforms and device revenues increase 8% to $11.6 billion, primarily reflecting growth in subscription revenues, partially offset by the shift in timing of the launch of our made by Google devices to the third quarter, compared with the fourth quarter in 2023. We continue to have significant growth in our subscription products, primarily due to increase in the number of paid subscribers across YouTube TV, YouTube Music Premium, and Google One. With regards to Platform, we saw a slight increase in the growth rate in Play, primarily due to a strong increase in the number of buyers. Google's service operating income increased 23% to $32.8 billion, and operating margin increased from 35% to 39%, representing a meaningful margin expansion. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which continued to deliver very strong results this quarter. Revenue increased by 30% to $12 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in GCP across core GCP products, AI infrastructure, and generative AI solutions. Once again, GCP grew at a rate that was much higher than cloud overall. Healthy Google Workspace growth was primarily driven by increase in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud operating income increased to $2.1 billion, and operating margin increased from 9.4% to 17.5%. We're pleased with the work the cloud team is doing to deliver valuable solutions to the customer and generate revenue growth, as well as its continued focus on driving efficiencies across the cloud business. As for Other Bets, for the fourth quarter, revenue were $400 million, and the operating loss was $1.2 billion. The year-over-year decline in revenue and increase in operating loss primarily reflect the milestone payment in the fourth quarter of 2023 for one of the Other Bets. Turning to Alphabet level activities, the largest component of this line is our investments in AI research and development activities which support all of Alphabet. As a reminder, Alphabet level activities have included nearly all severance charges from reductions in workforce and office space charges. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the biggest factor in year-over-year comparison is the $1.2 billion in charges in the fourth quarter of 2023, almost entirely in connection with office space optimization. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the fourth quarter was $14 billion, primarily reflecting investments in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component being investment in servers, followed by data centers, to support the growth of our business across Google Services, Google Cloud, and Google DeepMind. In Q4, we returned value to shareholders in the form of $15 billion in share purchases and $2.4 billion in dividend payments. Overall, we returned a total of nearly $70 billion to shareholders in 2024. Turning to 2025, I would like to provide some commentary on several factors that will impact our business performance in both the first quarter and the full year 2025. First in terms of revenue, I'll highlight two items that will have meaningful impact on Q1 revenue across the company. First in terms of revenues, I'll highlight two items that will have meaningful impact on Q1 revenues across the company. The first is the impact of foreign exchange rates. At the current spot rates, we expect a larger headwind to our revenues from the strengthening of the U.S dollar relative to key currencies in Q1 versus Q4 2024. Second is the impact of leap year. We expect a headwind from having one less day of revenue in Q1 2025 compared with leap year in the first quarter of 2024. As for our segments, Google Services, advertising revenue in 2025 will be impacted by lapping the strength we experience in the financial service vertical throughout 2024. And in Cloud, given the revenues are correlated with the timing of deployment of new capacity, we could see variability in cloud revenue growth rates depending on when new capacity comes online during 2025. Moving to investments, starting with our expectation for CapEx for the full year 2025. As we mentioned on the Q3 call, as we expand our AI efforts, we expect to increase our investments in capital expenditure for technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking. We expect to invest approximately $75 billion in CapEx in 2025 with approximately $16 billion to $18 billion of debt in the first quarter. The expected total investment level may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, primarily due to timing of deliveries and construction schedules. In terms of expenses, first, the increase in our investment in CapEx over the past few years will increase pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of higher depreciation. In 2024, we saw 28% year-over-year growth in depreciation as we put more technical infrastructure assets into service. Given the increase in CapEx investments over the past few years, we expect the growth rate and depreciation to accelerate in 2025. Second, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas such as AI and cloud. As you just heard from Sundar, we're delivering products and solutions to customer at a rapid pace, building, testing, and launching products faster than ever before. And as I mentioned on the Q3 call, we're doing that while also focusing on driving further efficiencies in how we operate the business. Before we take questions, I'd like to recap the financial results for the year. For the full year 2024, revenue grew by 14% or by $43 billion, reaching $350 billion. Google Services and Google Cloud each continue to see double-digit revenue growth coupled with margin extension. YouTube and cloud revenues combined, ended the year at $110 billion annual run rate. And in 2024, we generate total income of $112 billion, an increase of 33% from 2023. We're pleased with the momentum we're seeing in AI innovation and monetization. We've been using AI to improve the performance of our ads business for well over a decade, and Cloud is generating billions in annual revenue from AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions. We're also excited about the potential to bring new experiences to users that will provide additional opportunities for monetization. And I look forward to sharing more in our progress throughout the year. Sundar, Philipp, and I will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, one for Sundar, one for Anat. Sundar, maybe kind of step back on Search, there's a -- it seems like there's a lot of advances to come with Gen AI and agentic possibilities with Search. Can you just sort of walk us through your big picture vision over the next few years of how you think about your Search product continue to evolve to stay at the top of the funnel and drive more engagement and monetization for your users and advertisers. And then the second one, Anat, I think about 90 days ago, you talked about sort of further efficiencies and areas of simplification on the OpEx space. Can you just sort of walk us through some examples of where you see the potential for further efficiencies to the OpEx space, excluding the DNA step-ups that we have to come in 2025. Thanks. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Brian. On Search, obviously, we view, I mean, this has been a long continual journey. AI overviews has been the next step. It's playing out positively, as we have indicated, the metrics look great, and we are obviously trading on that experience, bringing better and better models, expanding to the number of queries where it works and so on. But there's a lot more to come. I think we'll continue bringing AI in more powerful ways, in multi-modal ways. Things like what we've done with Lens Circle to Search, you can imagine the future with Project Astra. You can also imagine areas like we have done in Gemini Deep Research, possibilities where you are really dramatically expanding the types of use cases for which Search can work, things which don't always get answered instantaneously but can take some time to answer. Those are all areas of explorations and you will see us, putting newer experiences in front of users through the course of 2025. And so I do feel the opportunity space with AI, there's a lot of unlock ahead. Anat Ashkenazi : Thanks. And for the question with regards to where do we see or where do I see leverage moving forward and some of the comments I've made on the previous call. I certainly see opportunities for further productivity and efficiency, and this is one of our priority areas. And we're going to do that so that we can make sure we continue to invest in areas such as AI and cloud where we see potential for continued growth. I'll remain focused on areas that I've mentioned before, which include the technical infrastructure, so the $75 billion in CapEx I mentioned for this year, the majority of that is going to go towards our technical infrastructure, which includes servers and data centers. So ensuring we do that in the most efficient way is critical. Second is managing headcount growth, and we're going to be investing in areas of growth, such as AI and cloud, but looking across the organization and moderating that growth will be important. Optimizing the real estate footprint is one of the areas I've mentioned. We're continuing to focus on that. As well as looking at how we simplify the organization, we've previously mentioned bringing like areas together. Sundar talked about bringing some of the AI research teams together so that we can operate with increased speed, but also how we operate within the organization. Using our own AI tools to how we run the business, whether it's the code that Sundar mentioned on the previous call, writing code with AI, or even running some of our key processes using AI tools. So we're looking at all that. It's going to -- it's -- this is not a one-quarter type of effort. It's going to continue throughout the year, and we're going to continue to focus on that so that we can support the growth in other areas. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions, one for Philipp and one for Anat. Philipp, can you just talk more about the expanded rollout of ads on AI overviews and perhaps what additional things you may have learned in 4Q? And I guess in particular, just curious if you rolled out to a higher percentage of commercial queries and is it still fair to say that you're monetizing nearly on par with existing search? And then Anat, just on the -- on cloud growth, a little bit of decel 3Q to 4Q, but it sounded like you also suggested that your capacity constrained in the fourth quarter. I just wanted to push on that a little bit more. How -- is that accurate and is it fair to say that revenue growth could have been higher with much more capacity? Thanks. Philipp Schindler : So, on your first question, first of all, AI overviews, which is really nice to see, continue to drive higher satisfaction and search usage. So, that's really good. And as you know, we recently launched the ads within AI overviews on mobile in the U.S., which builds on our previous rollout of ads above and below. And as I talked about before, for the AI overviews overall, we actually see monetization at approximately the same rate, which I think really gives us a strong base on which we can innovate even more. Anat Ashkenazi : On the cloud questions, so first I'm excited that we ended the quarter at $12 billion and a 30% year-over-year growth, very impressive growth. And as I've mentioned, the prepared remark, GCP grew at a much higher rate than overall cloud. Two items to think about from a deceleration perspective. The first is we are lapping a very strong quarter of [indiscernible] deployment in Q4 of 2023. The second is the one you've alluded to. We do see and have been seeing very strong demand for AI products in the fourth quarter in 2024. We exited the year with more demand than we had available capacity. So we are in a tight supply demand situation, working very hard to bring more capacity online. As I mentioned, we've increased investment in CapEx in 2024, continue to increase in 2025, and will bring more capacity throughout the year. Doug Anmuth : Thank you both. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan : Thank you for taking the question. I'll just ask one. Sundar, with the news that came out of China a little over 2 weeks ago, I think investors have been asking a lot of questions about the long-term cost curve for AI as AI moves from the infrastructure layer to the application layer or from training to inference and maybe even custom silicon becomes more dominant across the theme. I would love to get your perspective on your take on that news a couple of weeks ago and what it might mean for Alphabet longer term. Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Thanks, Eric. Look, I think there's been a lot of observations on DeepSeek. First of all, I think a tremendous team. I think they've done very, very good work. Look, I think for us it's always been obvious, over time, there's frontier model development, but you can drive a lot of efficiency to serve these models really, really well. And if you look at one of the areas in which the Gemini model shine is the Pareto frontier of cost, performance, and latency and if you look at all three attributes, I think we lead this Pareto frontier. And I would say both are 2.0 flash models or 2.0 flash thinking models. They are some of the most efficient models out there, including comparing to DeepSeek's V3 and R1. And I think a lot of it is our strength of the full stack development into an optimization, our obsession with cost per query, all of that, I think, sets us up well for the workloads ahead, both to serve billions of users across our products and on the cloud side. Couple of things I would say are, if you look at the trajectory over the past 3 years, the proportion of the spend towards inference compared to training has been increasing, which is good because obviously inference is to support businesses with good ROIC. And so I think that trend is good. I think the reasoning models, if anything, accelerates that trend because it's obviously scaling upon inference dimension as well. And so I think, look, I think part of the reason we are so excited about the AI opportunity is we know we can drive extraordinary use cases because the cost of actually using it is going to keep coming down, which will make more use cases feasible. And that's the opportunity space. It's as big as it comes. And that's why you're seeing us invest to meet that moment. Eric Sheridan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Michael Nathanson : Thank you. I have two, one for Philipp and one for Anat. Philipp, question for you is we're starting to see more AI tools on eCommerce sites and something like research with AI recommendations is on Google Shopping. Can you talk about how that product and other AI tools are impacting shopping behavior? I've had that impact in modernization. And then I guess the $75 billion question Anat is, how do you think about long-term capital intensity for this business? It sounds like there's a bit of constraint in terms of getting things built, but how do you think about the modeling of capital intensity going forward, and what are the things that you're looking forward to in terms of whether or not this is the right level of spend? Thank you. Philipp Schindler : Look, excellent question. We've been using our advances in AI to make search for products on Google even easier, obviously. And in Q4, we actually introduced quite a transformed Google Shopping experience, which we rebuilt from the ground up with AI. And people shop more than a billion times a day across Google. Last quarter, we introduced this fully reinvented Google Shopping experience. In December, we saw roughly, I mentioned, as 13% more daily active users in Google Shopping in the U.S compared to the same period last year. So that's a good development here. And the new Google Shopping experiences, specifically to your question, uses AI to really intelligently show the most relevant products, helping to speed up and simplify your research. You get an AI-generated brief with top things to consider for your search, plus maybe products that meet your needs. So shoppers very often want low prices. So the new page not only includes like deal finding tools like price comparison, price insights, price tracking throughout, but there's also a new and dedicated personalized deals page where you can browse deals for you, and all this is really built on the backbone of AI. So we think this is a very interesting opportunity. Anat Ashkenazi : And on the question of capital expenditure, and I think you may have two questions in there, one is just the capital intensity and then how would we think about return on that invested capital. So on the first one, certainly we are looking ahead, but we are managing very responsibly with a very rigorous even internal governance process looking at how do we allocate the capacity and what would we need to support the customer demand externally, but also across the Google, the Alphabet business. And as you've seen in the comment I've just made on cloud, we do have demand that exceeds our available capacity, so we'll be working hard to address that and make sure we bring more capacity online. We do have the benefit of having a very broad business, and we can repurpose capacity, whether it's through Google Services or Google Cloud to support, as I said, whether it's Search or GDM or Google Cloud Customers, we can do that in a more efficient manner. We also look at every investment that we make to ensure that we're doing it in the most cost-efficient way to optimize our data center. As you know, our strategy is mostly to rely on our own self-design and build data centers. So they're industry-leading in terms of both cost and power efficiency at scale. We have our own customized TPUs. They're customized for our own workload. So, they do deliver outstanding superior performance and CapEx efficiency. So, we're going to be looking at all that when we make decisions as to how we're going to progress capital investments throughout the coming years. Michael Nathanson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Your line is now open. Mark Shmulik : Yes, thanks for taking the question. Sundar, I just wanted to follow-up to Brian's question from earlier. With your own Project Mariner efforts and a competitor's recent launch, it seems there's suddenly really strong momentum on AI consumer agents and kind of catching up to that old Google duplex vision. I think when you look a few years ahead, where do you see consumer agents going and really, what does it mean to Google Search outside of Lens? Is there room for both to flourish or will they eventually be in conflict with each other? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : Look, I think first of all, we are definitely seeing a lot of progress in the underlying capabilities of these models. Gemini 2.0 was definitely built with the view of enabling more agentic use cases. And so, I actually, and we are definitely seeing progress inside, and I think we'll be able to do more agentic experiences for our users. Look, I actually think all of this expands the opportunity space. I think historically we've had information use cases, but now you can have, you can act on your information needs in a much deeper way. It's always been our vision when we have talked about Google Assistant, et cetera. So I think the opportunity space expands. I think there's plenty of, it feels very far from a zero-sum game. There's plenty of room, I think, for many new types of use cases to flourish. And I think for us, we have a clear sense of additional use cases we can start to tackle for our users in Google Search. And all the early work with AI overview shows that users will react positively to that. So, I'm pretty excited about what's ahead. Operator : Your next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open. Ross Sandler : Great. One on infrastructure and then one on the guidance on revenue. So Sundar, if we look at the inference cost per 1 million tokens and not the API pricing we see for Gemini versus something like GPT-4, but the raw cost of generating inference tokens on your TPU stack. How much more efficient do you think you guys are in terms of generating 1 million tokens compared to inference costs running on your cloud peers? Do you see this as an advantage as everything shifts to inference? And then Anat, you call out lapping the financial services category strength in 2025 as a bit of a problem for Search. Could you just quantify a little bit of that? Is that kind of the same as when you guys talk about lapping the Asia outbound advertiser channel? Any numbers you could put around that headwind? Thank you very much. Sundar Pichai : Ross, like, look, the whole TPU project started, V1 was effectively an inferencing chip, so we've always, part of the reason we have taken the end-to-end stack approach is that, so that we can definitely drive a strong differentiation in end-to-end optimizing, and not only on a cost, but on a latency basis and a performance basis. We have the Pareto frontier we mentioned, and I think our full-stack approach and our TPU efforts all play -- give a meaningful advantage, and we plan, you already see that. I know you asked about the cost, but it's effectively captured. When we price outside, we pass on the differentiation. It's partly why we've been able to bring forward flash models at very attractive value props, which is what is driving both developer growth. We've doubled our developers to 4.4 million in just about 6 months. Vertex usage is up 20x last year. And so all of that is a direct result of that approach and so we will continue doing that. Anat Ashkenazi : And on the question regarding my comment on lapping the strength in financial services, this is primarily related to the structural changes with regards to insurance, it is more specifically within financial services, it was the insurance segment and we saw that continue, but it was a one-time kind of a step up and then we saw it throughout the year. I am not going to give any specific numbers as to what we expect to see in 2025, but I am pleased with the fact that we are seeing and continue to see strength across really all verticals including retail and exiting the year in a position of strength. If anything, I would highlight as you think about the year, the comments I have made about the impact of FX, as well as the fact that we have one less day of revenue in Q1. Operator : Your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. A couple for Philipp. You mentioned higher search usage with overviews. Just wondering how you're feeling about overall Search usage. Is it accelerating as you integrate more AI? I know there's a lot of traffic growth at competitors with AI, but just wondering if you're seeing a real increase in total volumes of information gathering. And then second, on YouTube, thinking about kind of maybe a move from more professional content to user-generated content, what is that doing for your usage, and how do you think about the margin impact from that? Thank you. Philipp Schindler : Maybe on -- Justin on Search usage overall, our metrics are healthy. We are continuing to see growth in Search on a year-on-year basis in terms of overall usage. Of course, within that, AI overviews has seen stronger growth, particularly across all segments of users, including in younger users. So it's being well received. But overall, I think through this AI moment, I think Search is continuing to perform well. And as I said earlier, we have a lot more innovations to come this year. I think the product will evolve even more. And I think as you make Search, as you give, as you make it more easy for people to interact and ask follow-up questions, et cetera, I think we have an opportunity to drive further growth. Sundar Pichai : And some color on your YouTube question. Look, YouTube ads overall had a very healthy growth in Q4 driven by brand followed by direct response. The U.S. election advertising led brand revenue growth, and we saw nearly double the spending from 2020. I mentioned that we also had a strong contribution from finance, retail, and the tech verticals. So overall, strong operating metrics. Watch time growth remains robust, particularly in key monetization opportunity areas, such as Shorts and Living Room, just to set the stage here one more time. On your question specifically on the UGC side, look, we have a very strong position with creators and we've always said creators are at the center of YouTube success here. They're the number one most important thing we care about and this strong position really gives us a lot of confidence here. Today we have more than 3 million channels that are actually in the YouTube Partner Program, which is really an incredible program. So we're very confident with the position we have and where this goes. Justin Post : Thank you. Operator : And our last question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Ken Gawrelski : Thank you very much. Two, please. I want to focus on Gemini and the consumer agent side. Sundar, there was some press reports that suggested you have an ambitious goal on growing the usage by the end of '25. Two questions on that, please. First, what\u2019s -- how should we think about the approach that you're going to employ to achieve this goal? Is it more aggressive marketing for Gemini as a standalone product, or is it tighter integration into existing experiences, whether it be search mail, maps, et cetera. And then the second one is, how should we think about the future monetization opportunity of Gemini? Today, it's really a premium subscription offering or a free offering. Over time, do you see an ad component and anything you can share on that, please? Thank you. Sundar Pichai : First of all, we've had strong momentum for Gemini on the app side, particularly through the second half of 2024. And some of it is we've made it more easily accessible. We've brought it to, for example, with a dedicated app on iOS, which has been super positively received and definitely getting a lot of traction there. So definitely driving organic growth by putting the product out. We just last week rolled out with our 2.0 series of models. So 2.0 Flash, I mean, I think that's one of the most capable models you can access at the free tier. So that's definitely contributing as well. And so we are rapidly trading. We've had a couple of key innovations there. Gemini Live, I think, has been definitely a hit with users, as well as for advanced users, Gemini Deep Research. So I think a combination of innovation, continually trading on the product and making it better, is driving a lot of usage. And we'll have a lot more to come as we go this year. And we obviously have a partnership with Samsung, so there are other things which will contribute to it as well. On the monetization side, obviously for now we are focused on a free tier and subscriptions, but obviously as you've seen in Google over time, we always want to lead with user experience, We do have very good ideas for native ad concepts, but you will see us lead with the user experience. But I do think we're always committed to making the products work and reach billions of users at scale. And advertising has been a great aspect of that strategy. And so just like you've seen with YouTube, we'll give people options over time. But for this year, I think you will see us be focused on the subscription direction. Ken Gawrelski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you and that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks. Jim Friedland : Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2025 call. Thank you and have a good evening. Operator : Thank you everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
